Title: MICROWAVE HOT AIR NFA POPCORN. <T>
Categories: Digest, July
Yield: 1 Servings
- microwave
- small-to-medium size paper
Sack (heavier brown sacks,
Heavier than
The bulk brown paper lunch
Bags, seems to work the
Best; they seem to
Be the "right weight".
- Orville Redenbacher's Hot
Air popcorn (this seems to
Work the
Best for me).
Put some kernels into bag, and put bag into microwave. (I fold the
open end over once.) As microwaves seem to very greatly, I won't
recommend temps or times; I usually have to experiment a little with
every "new" microwave that I encounter. I'd probably start with the
temp that you'd use for regular microwave popcorn. Of course, time is
influenced by the amt of popcorn kernels.

I hover around the microwave until the rate of popping slows down. I
then remove and enjoy! (I like it unadorned.) I'm willing to put up
with the occasional bag with a lot of unpopped kernels as I much
prefer this to the alternative. I can keep paper sacks and popcorn in
my desk easily enough.

I started doing it this way several years ago, but recently I've had
two different people comment on this, so I was inspired to pass it on
(as I'm munching and typing ;-).
