Title: MATZOH BALL SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Melted fat or oil
2 lg Eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 c  Matzo meal
1 ts Salt (optional)
2 tb Soup stock or water
Blend fat, or oil, and eggs together.  Add matzo meal and salt
mixture to egg and blend well.  Then add soup stock or water and mix
until uniform. Cover mixing bowl and place in refrigerator for 15
minutes. Using a two or three quart pot bring 1 1/2 quarts of
slightly salted water (no salt if desired) to a brisk boil. Reduce
flame, and into the slightly boiling water drop balls approximately 1
inch in diameter formed from mixture from refrigerator. Cover pot and
cook 30 to 40 minutes. Have soup at room temperature, or warmer, and
remove matzo balls from water and place in soup pot. When ready to
serve, allow soup to simmer for about 5 minutes. Makes about eight
balls.

Oh yes, the soup.  Any chicken or vegetable soup, Kosher Shel Pesach,
will do fine.  I prefer the vegetable. My favorite Jewish cuisine
book is "Jewish Cookery", by Leah H. Leonard. I'm sorry this is too
late for your Pesach Seder.
