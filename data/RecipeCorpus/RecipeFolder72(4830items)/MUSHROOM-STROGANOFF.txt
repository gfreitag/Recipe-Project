by one, and trim off the hard stems. Cut in wide strips. Strain the
liquid through cheesecloth, there should be about 2 cups. Simmer the
liquid until it is reduced by slightly more than half. Thickly slice
the fresh mushrooms. Saute the minced onion in butter until they are
transparent, then add the sliced fresh mushrooms and toss over high
heat until they have released their excess water and it is starting
to evaporate. Season with thyme, salt and pepper to taste. Add the
soaked mushroom strips and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Gradually
whisk the mushroom liquid into the sour cream, and add this mixture
to the mushrooms. Simmer gently, stirring often, for 15 to 20 min.
Stir in the brandy and sherry.  Boil the noodles in salted water
until they are just tender, but not yet soft. Serve with stroganoff
sauce, and a crisp salad.
