MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1    Recipe BASIC TOMATO SAUCE
-(see separate recipe)
1 ts Vegetable oil; divided
In a large, non-stick skillet, warm the butter or margarine over
medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute until very soft, about 6
minutes. Turn mushrooms onto a cutting board and chop again.

In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the mushrooms, ground turkey,
ground beef, bread crumbs, egg whites, Asiago cheese, oregano,
rosemary, salt and pepper. Knead the mixture together thoroughly with
your hands. To prevent sticking, dip your hands into cool water
before forming each meatball. Form mixture into 30 1-inch balls.

Put the tomato sauce into a large, heavy-bottom saucepan and bring to
a simmer over low heat. Warm 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large
non-stick skillet. Add half the meatballs to the skillet and brown
them on all sides. Spoon the meatballs into the tomato sauce. Add the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil to the skillet and brown the
rest of the meatballs, then add them to the sauce. Simmer, stirring,
for 20 minutes.

While sauce is simmering, prepare pasta according to package
directions; drain. Transfer to a large serving bowl. Remove bay
leaves from sauce; pour sauce over pasta and serve.
