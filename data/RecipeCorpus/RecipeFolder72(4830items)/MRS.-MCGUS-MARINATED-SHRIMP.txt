This is an excellent cold seafood dish for a buffet and originated in
Louisiana, probably 40-50 years ago.

Bring to boil enough water to cover shrimp. Add beer, celery tops, 3
1/2 tsp salt, and pickling spice. Add shrimp and bring to boil again.
Remove from heat and allow to cool in pot, then peel. In suitable
dish alternate layers of shrimp and onion. Combine olive oil,
vinegar, 1 1/2 tsp salt, celery seed, capers with juice, Tabasco
Sauce to taste, garlic, and heavy with the paprika. Pour sauce over
shrimp. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours. From the files of Al Rice,
