Title: NOODLES WITH MUSTARD BUTTER
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
8 oz Egg noodles
1/2 ts Salt
MUSTARD BUTTER:
4 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Dijon mustard
1 ts Fresh lemon juice
Dash of cayenne pepper
Small handful chopped fresh
-parsley
Bring 3 or 4 quarts of water to a boil. In the meantime prepare the
mustard butter.  Cream the butter with the remaining ingredients by
hand, or use a food processor or blender.

Add the noodles and salt to the boiling water.  Cook the noodles
until al dente.  (The time needed will depend greatly upon the
thickness of the noodles, so the best test is simply bite into a
noodle to determine whether it is done.)  Drain the noodles
thoroughly and toss with the prepared butter until each strand is
coated. Serve at once. Serves 6 Typed in MMFormat by
