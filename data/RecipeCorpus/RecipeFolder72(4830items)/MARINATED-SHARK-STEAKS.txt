Title: MARINATED SHARK STEAKS
Categories: Foreign, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
INGREDIENTS:
1 1/2 lb Shark steaks
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Rice or wine vinegar
-(balsamic is *delightful*
-here!)
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Oil
2 tb Chopped parsley
1    Clove garlick, pressed or
-minced
1/2 ts Freshly-ground black pepper
minced green onions and parsley

(TIP):  Fish should be cooked only until it flakes easily. Check it
often to prevent overcooking, which will not only make it rubbery, it
will render it tasteless. A good way to check is to check it for
opacity. When it has turned from translucent to white and opaque it's
done. It will finish cooking  on its own with residual heat if
removed from the heat source.

Fish  is  a high protein but low-calorie main dish.
By  using  a light marinade  you  eliminate rich butter sauces and
still maintain the delicate flavor.

Cut the shark steaks into service-sized pieces.
Place them in  a glass dish.   Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, lemon
juice,  oil parsley, garlick and black pepper. Pour the marinade over
the fish and marinate for half an hour, turning at least once.

Remove  the fish (reserving the marinade)  and broil 4 to 5 inches
from the heat - about four minutes a side.
Brush with the marinade before turning.

Serve with minced green onions and parsley. Accompaniments: Rice and
vegetable pilaf,  leaf lettuce tossed with parsley-lemon dressing, and
French or Italian sourdough bread.
