Title: OLD FASHIONED CREAM SCONES
Categories: Scones
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
3 ts Baking powder
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
4 tb Butter
2    Eggs, beaten -- see note
1/3 c  Heavy cream
2 ts Sugar
I often add dried cranberries and minced orange zest to the dry
ingredients before adding the eggs and cream.

Note: Reserve 1 Tablespoon egg white for brushing on top.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Combine flour, baking powder, 2 Tablespoons sugar and salt. Cut in
butter with your fingers, a fork or two knives. Beat eggs slightly
with cream, and stir into flour mixture. Turn out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead only until dough sticks together. Divide in
two parts. Rolls each part out into a circle that is 1" thick and 6"
in diameter. Cut each circle into 4 wedges, and put wedges on
ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes.
