Title: OKRA WITH TOMATOES & ONIONS
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Fresh young okra
3/4 lb Onion; sliced thickly
6 tb Olive oil
3    Garlic cloves; halved
1 lb Tomatoes; skinned & sliced
Salt and black pepper
1    Lemon (juice only)
Wash okra. Cut off any hard stems and dry okra thoroughly. Heat oil in
large saucepan and fry onions with the halved garlic cloves until
slightly soft, transparent, and golden. Add okra and continue to fry
until slightly softened. Add the sliced tomatoes and saute for a few
min. longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover with water,
bring to a boil and simmer until the okra is very tender, usually
about 1 hour. Squeeze in the lemon juice and cook for a further 15
min. (If using canned okra, cooking time will be much shorter. Serve
hot or cold. If to be served cold, allow to cool in the saucepan
before turning out into a serving dish. Recipe from "A Book of Middle
Eastern Food" by Claudia Roden. Alfred A. Knopf, 1972. Posted by
