Title: MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
2 pk Active dry yeast; or
1/4 c  Luke-warm water; (110 deg.f)
2 ea Eggs; lg
1/4 c  Shortening
2 ts Salt
2 ts Active dry yeast; bulk
7 c  Unbleached flour; sifted
Scald the milk in a saucepan.  Pour over the shortening, sugar and
salt in a large mixing bowl. Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast
over the lukewarm water and stir to dissolve.  Add the yeast mixture,
3 cups of the flour, and eggs to the milk mixture. Beat, using an
electric mixer set on medium speed, for about 2 minutes.  Gradually
stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Turn the
dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and
satiny, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl,
turning once to grease the top and cover. Let rise in a warm place
until double, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and divide the dough
into thirds, then let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Divide each
third into 12 pieces and shape each piece into a ball. Place 12
balls, equally spaced, in a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Repeat for
the remaining two thirds. Cover and let rise until doubled, 45 to 60
minutes. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes
or until golden brown.  Remove from the pans and cool on wire racks.
