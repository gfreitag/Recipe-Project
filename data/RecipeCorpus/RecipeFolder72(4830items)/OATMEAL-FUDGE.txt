Title: OATMEAL FUDGE
Categories: Chocolate, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Stick butter
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Milk
Bring to boil and stir while
-boiling for 3 min. exactly.
Remove from burner and add:
1/2 c  Cocoa
2 c  Oatmeal
1/2 c  Coconut
1/2 c  Pecans
1 ts Vanilla
1 pn Of salt
Oatmeal Fudge

Mix quickly and spoon out onto wax paper.

Make  sure  you  get all of  your  ingredients together first because
you must mix the second half of the stuff in as soon as you take the
boiling mixture off the stove.  It really is  good and very sweet. I
usually make just a half recipe.

Happy cooking!
