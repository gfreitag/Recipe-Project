Title: MATTHEW SCHALL'S REAL PINA COLADA GELATINE
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Rum
3/4 c  Coconut Milk
2 1/4 c  Pineapple Juice
4    Envelopes Unflavored
-Gelatin, (1 box)
1/2 c  Sugar
Start by mixing and heating fruit juices to a simmer. Pour rum (at
room temp.) into a large bowl, and sprinkle gelatin over rum avoiding
clumps. Let sit a minute, then add hot fruit juice while stirring
with a fork (a beater makes it too fuffy). Add sugar and stir until
dissolved. Chill to set.

NOTES : "If one lives in an impoverished city like New Orleans,
pineapple Jello may be difficult to find. As an alternative, I made
real coladas and gelatinized them. They came out great and were very
popular during Mardi Gras this year.
