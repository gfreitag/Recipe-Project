Categories: Poultry, Mexican, Pork, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Mulato chiles
6    Pasilla chiles
8 lb Turkey, in pieces
1 lb Pork loin, in 2" chunks
4 tb Lard
1/2 c  Almonds
1/2 c  Peanuts
1    Tortilla, coarsely chopped
4 tb Sesame seeds
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Anise
1 lb Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 ts Sugar
Prepare the chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano
Picante. Place the turkey and pork in a large kettle with enough
salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook, covered, for 1
hour. Drain, reserving the stock. Dry the turkey and pork pieces
thoroughly with paper towels. Heat the lard in a large, heavy
skillet. Brown the turkey and pork pieces, a few at a time; then
transfer to a flameproof casserole. In the electric blender, blend
the almonds, peanuts, tortilla, 2 tbs of the sesame seeds, cloves,
cinnamon, anise, tomatoes, and the prepared chiles, and reduce to a
coarse puree.

Heat the lard remaining in the skillet, adding a little more if
necessary, and cook the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add 2 cups of the reserved stock, the chocolate, salt and pepper to
taste, and sugar. Stir until chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce
over the turkey and pork in the casserole; cover; and cook over very
low heat for about 1 hour, taking care not to let it burn. Sauce
should be the consistency of heavy cream, so, if necessary, thin with
more stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before serving.
