Title: MUSHROOM-CREAM-SAUCE
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Sauces and
Yield: 1 Servings
250 g  Mushrooms -- (or more)
Butter
1/4 l  Heavy Cream
2    Garlic Cloves -- or more
Salt And White Pepper
Slice the mushrooms and cut the garlic in little pieces. Melt some
butter in a saucepan, add garlic and a little later also the
mushrooms and stew it for a while until the mushrooms are no longer
raw. Add the cream and reduce the sauce by letting it boil/simmer.
Finally add pepper and salt to your taste.

You can use some (potato) starch if you prefer the sauce less fluid. I
usually serve this with Tagliatelle.
