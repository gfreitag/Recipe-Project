Title: NEW SAUSAGE ROLLS
Categories: Appetizers, Meats
Yield: 36 Rolls
1 pk (14oz) Puff pastry
3    Cooked Italian sausages
Cut the package of puff pastry into 3 pieces. On a floured surface,
roll out 1 piece of dough so it measures 6x12-inches and 1/8-inch
thick. Cut sausages in half, lengthwise. Lay 2 halves, end to end,
curved sides down on pastry. Roll snugly. Trim off any excess dough
and tuck pastry ends under flat side of sausage. Pinch to seal. Slice
into 1-inch lengths. Repeat with remaining sausages and pastry. Place
seam-side down on a baking sheet, 1 inch apart. Bake in a 400F oven
until golden, about 25 minutes.
