To Donna C And everyone else. I have been experimenting to get a
really great tasting NY RYE. All the recipes in the books and on
board were too dense for me. I finally came up with one that my
family really liked. Let me know how you all feel.

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS FOR THE BIG 1 1/2 LB. BREAD MAKER SCALE DOWN FOR
YOUR NEEDS. Put on white bread mode. I don't have a turbo so I don't
know how it would be on that mode. Hope you'all enjoy!

Mort has made this bread for the past month and now it is our
favorite as well.  It works well with Smiley's yeast and I don't add
the gluton (cause we are out of it, <g>) and it is STILL fine! * We
use 2 or 3 T of the caraway seeds...YUM! Reformatted by Elaine Radis
