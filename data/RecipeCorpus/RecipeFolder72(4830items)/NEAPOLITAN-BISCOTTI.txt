Title: NEAPOLITAN BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 50 Biscotti
1 1/2 c  Whole almonds
2 c  All purpose flour
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/3 c  Honey
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 lg Egg
1 lg Egg yolk
1 ts Finely grated orange peel
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 F. Line large
baking sheet with foil. Butter foil. Finely grind 3/4 cup almonds in
processor. Transfer to large bowl. Add flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda and cinnamon. Whisk honey, oil, egg, yolk and orange peel
in small bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients and stir until dough
just begins to hold together (if dough seems firm and dry, let stand
10 minutes to soften). Turn out dough onto lightly floured work
surface. Add remaining 3/4 cup almonds and knead to distribute
evenly. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 12-inch-long,
2-inch-wide log. Place logs on prepared sheet, spacing 4 inches
apart. Bake until firm to touch and dark brown (logs may crack),
about 40 minutes. Cool logs on sheet on rack 15 minutes. Transfer
logs to work surface. Using serrated knife, cut logs diagonally into
1/2-inch-thick slices. Place cut side down on same foil-lined sheet
and bake until light brown and dry, about 12 minutes. Cool on sheet
on rack. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room
temperature.) These not-too-sweet cookies are based on an old recipe
seldom seen these days. Although the combination of almonds, honey
and cinnamon is still a typical one, contemporary Neapolitan biscotti
tend to be less aggressively flavored.
