Simmer all stock ingredients in water for about 45 minutes. Remove

and cut or tear into small pieces. Strain stock reserving 3 cups or
so. Add chicken and ingredients list for soup.  Bring to a simmer
while you are preparing the dumplings.

Dumplings can either be made with Bisquick or you make them with the
ingredients listed above.  Mix dry ingredients and cut in Crisco,
using a pastry blender or two knives. Add parsley or dill and stir
milk in with a wooden fork.  Do not overmix.  Drop by large spoonfuls
on top of the simmering soup.  Simmer 5 minutes with the lid off,
then cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
