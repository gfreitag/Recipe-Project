Title: MARINATED FLANK STEAK W/LEMON HERB BUTTER
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Flank steak, 1 to 1 1/2lbs
1/4 c  Ea. salad oil & dry red wine
1 tb Worcestershire
2 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Dry mustard
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Summer savory leaves
MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
1    Watercress sprigs
Lemon herb butter:  Beat 1/3 cup soft butter until fluffy; gradually
beat in 1 1/2 T lemon juice until well combined. Mix in 3 T each
finely chopped parsley and watercress, 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce,
1/4 tsp. tarragon and dash white pepper.  Shape into a roll or cube,
wrap, and chill to blend flavors. Place steak in shallow dish. In a
covered jar or blender, shake together oil, wine, worcestershire
sauce, soy sauce, mustard, garlic, salt, sugar, and savory. Pour over
steak, turning to coat well. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hrs. or more,
turning once or twice. Remove steak, reserving marinade.  Place on a
rack in a broiling pan. Broil about 4" from heat, until well browned
(about 6 minutes per side for rare), brushing occasionally with
marinade.  Slice thinly, cutting diagonally. Serve topped with thin
slices of lemon herb butter. Garnish with watercress. TIPS: Flank
steak will be most tender if cooked only to rare or medium rare stage
of doneness.  Cooked more, it tends to become rather tough. You can
substitute 2 T cider vinegar for 1/4 cup dry red wine.
