Title: MUSHROOM PT
Categories: Vegan, Appetizers
Yield: 2 Servings
1 md Onion; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
50 g  Butter*
1    Thick slice wholemeal bread
A little milk or water
100 g  Mushrooms
1 ts Sea salt
2 ts Mixed herbs, chopped
Grated nutmeg
Black pepper
*(Vegans use vegan margarine or oil instead of butter)

Wholesome and full of flavour, this mushroom pt also has a
mouth-watering softness on the palate. Serve it on granary toast,
with a slice of tomato as garnish - or take it on a picnic.

Stew the chopped onion and garlic gently in 25 g (1 oz) of the butter
until soft. Meanwhile, soak the bread in a little milk or water, and
chop the mushrooms. Now fry the mushrooms with the onion and garlic,
squeeze the bread and crumble it into the pan. Add the chopped herbs,
salt, pepper and a little grated nutmeg.

Cook all together for a minute or two, then liquidize the mixture,
together with the rest of the butter. Press into a small dish and
refrigerate for several hours.
