Title: MICROWAVE GRAINS
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 ea Brown rice
1/3 ea Barley
1/3 ea Millet
I was bored with rice, so I mixed 1/3 brown rice, 1/3 barley, and 1/3
millet.  Rinsed well, then put it in the microwave for ten minutes on
high, and let it stand for a few hours. (I just put it in a big
plastic bowl, and I didn't measure the water.)  It was yummy
underneath chili, beans, and spaghetti sauce. (3 different meals.)
