Title: MUJADDARA (SP?)
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Brown rice (dry) - OR -
3/4 c  Bulghur (dry)
1 c  Lentils
1 lg Onion
1 ts Cumin
x  Salt & pepper
~ start 3/4 cup brown rice cooking; alternatively reserve that much
uncooked bulghur - start 1 cup lentils cooking - dice and brown 1
large onion in some huge amount of olive oil (I used less than the 6
Tbs called for, which cuts down on the taste) - after 30 minutes of
the lentils cooking, toss in the rice (drained) or bulghur, the
onion, 1 tsp cumin [I've used twice as much and added some coriander
as well], and some pepper and salt. simmer another 15 minutes - brown
(caramellize) another diced onion - add the onion to the top of the
lentil/grain mixture; let sit
10    minutes

The dish has a good consistency. I've made this twice in the past
week from George Lasalle's "Orphanides: My Middle Eastern Cooking";
off the top of my head:
