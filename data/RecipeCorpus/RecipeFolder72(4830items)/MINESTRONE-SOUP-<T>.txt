3 c  Cooked cranberry beans or
Pink beans
2    Cloves garlic, minced

Puree the white beans.  Put into a big stock pot (10 qt) with the
cranberry beans.  Saute the garlic, carrots, onions and celery until
onions are just turning translucent.  Add to pot.  Add the rest of
the ingredients to the pot and fill the pot with water to within 1

soft. Add salt if desired AFTER the full cooking time.

This was one thick soup!  I thinned it out before consuming it.
