Comments Panna cotta is an Italian dessert that literally means
"cooked cream", which is usually what the traditional recipe consists
of. I took some creative liberties and added mascarpone and sour
cream.

Directions Place mixed berries in a small bowl and crush slightly
with the back of spoon. Stir in 3 tablespoons sugar. Cover with
plastic wrap and set aside. Spray four 3/4 cup ramekins with cooking
spray. In a small bowl, pour 1 tablespoon milk. Sprinkle gelatin over
and allow it to soften (10 minutes). Meanwhile, combine cream, 1/3
cup milk, vanilla, and 1/4 cup sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil
over medium high heat, stirring often. Remove from heat, add gelatin
mixture and stir until melted. Let the mixture cool. In a medium
sized bowl, whisk together mascarpone cheese and sour cream until
smooth. Slowly add the hot cream mixture into the bowl, whisking
constantly. Pour mixture into prepared ramekins. Chill until cold and
set (at least 3 hours and up to 12) Run a small knife around the edge
of the ramekins to loosen the panna cotta. If that doesn't work, dip
the bottom of the ramekin in hot water for a few seconds. Invert
ramekin onto a plate. Spoon berry sauce over panna cotta. Serve. Walt
