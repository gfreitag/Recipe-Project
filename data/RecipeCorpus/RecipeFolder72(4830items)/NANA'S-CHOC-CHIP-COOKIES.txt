Title: NANA'S CHOC CHIP COOKIES
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Butter or margarine
1/2 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 c  Caster sugar
1    Egg
1/2 c  Chopped nuts (we use pecans)
4 oz Dark chocolate, chopped, or
-dark chocolate bits
1 ts Vanilla (vanilla essence)
3/4 c  Plain flour
1/2 c  Self-raising flour
Cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy.

Add the egg, nuts, chocolate and vanilla Mix well

Gradually add sifted flours, mix thoroughly

Roll teaspoonsfull of mixture into balls.  Place on greased oven
trays. (I actually use baking paper, as the biscuits don't stick, but
it makes less mess! :-)) (Don't flatten the mixture onto the trays -
leave them as balls).

Allow room for spreading of cookies.

Bake in moderate oven (180 C) for 15 minutes.
