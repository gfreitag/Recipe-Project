Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
3 tb Dry yeast
1 ts Sucanat*
1 c  Warm water
3/4 c  Rye flour
2 c  Wholewheat flour
1 ts Salt
1 c  Oatbran
1 tb Carob or cocoa powder
1 ts Caraway seeds
1 ts Fennel seeds
2 tb Cider vinegar
2 tb Dark molasses
2 tb Corn oil
1 tb Minced onion
Dissolve yeast & sucanat in about 1/2 c water & set aside till yeast
is foamy.

Combine rye flour, wholewheat flour, salt, oatbran, carob, carawy &
fennel seeds.

In a separate bowl, combine the vinegar, molasses, oil & onion. Add
wet ingredients to the dry ingredients & blend well. Add yeast & mix
well. If the dough is too stiff or dry, add more water. If too sticky
add more flour.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface; flatten it
out; shape it into a round, shallow loaf.  Place loaf on a lightly
oiled baking sheet, brush dough with oil & let it rise in a warm spot
until the dough holds an imprint when gently touched (about 30
minutes). Bake at 375F for 35 to 40 minutes & cool on a wire rack.
Lightly brush the top with oil.
