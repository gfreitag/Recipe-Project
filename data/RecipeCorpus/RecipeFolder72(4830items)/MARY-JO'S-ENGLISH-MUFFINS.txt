Title: MARY JO'S ENGLISH MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Breads
Yield: 20 Muffins
2 tb Dry yeast
3 c  Warm water
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Dry milk
8 c  Flour, divided
6 tb Vegetable oil
In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Add the sugar, salt
and dry milk and bland. Add half the flour and whisk for 1 minute.
Set the mixture aside for 1 hour, or until the sponge falls back on
itself. Beat in the oil. Add the remaining flour and mix well. Add
extra flour if necessary to make a fairly stiff dough.

With floured hands cut out about 20 four-ounce pieces of dough and
form them into 3-inch patties. Place the patties on a greased cookie
sheet and let rise about half and hour, or until they are doubled in
bulk.

Preheat griddle to 325 to 350 F and cook approximately
7    minutes per side.

For Cinnamon-Raisin English Muffins: Add 1 tbs. cinnamon and 1 cup
raisins with the remaining flour.

For whole wheat English muffins: Substitute "crunchy whole wheat
flour mix" for white flour:

2 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups cracked wheat flour
4 cups unbleached white flour
