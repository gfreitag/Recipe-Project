1/2 lb Cultivated mushrooms --
Sliced 1/2 inch
2 c  Cherry tomatoes or 4 to 6

1 tb Cornstarch -- optional
16 oz Fusilli pasta
In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat 3 tablespoons
water, the onion, garlic, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, fennel,
oregano, basil, and fennel seed. Cover and cook, adding more water if
the mixture becomes dry, for about 10 minutes, and stir occasionally
to break up the cherry tomatoes. Stir in the canned tomatoes, crushed
red pepper, and salt, if using, and pepper and spray lightly with
olive oil. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes.

If the sauce is too thin, mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with the
reserved tomato juice. Increase the heat to high, and add the
cornstarch mixture, stirring until thickened.

Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling water, cook the pasta; drain and
remove to a warm serving bowl. Spoon the sauce over the pasta and
serve immediately.
