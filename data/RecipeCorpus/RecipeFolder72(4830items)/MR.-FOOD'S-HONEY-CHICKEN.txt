============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a shallow dish,
combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper. Place ½ cup of the
melted butter in another shallow dish. Dip the chicken pieces in the
flour mixture, then in the butter, coating completely. Place skin
side down in a single layer in a 9" x 13" baking dish that has been
coated with nonstick vegetable spray; b NOTE: My grandchildren love
this served over hot cooked rice 'cause the rice soaks up all the
rich honey flavor. Give it a try!
