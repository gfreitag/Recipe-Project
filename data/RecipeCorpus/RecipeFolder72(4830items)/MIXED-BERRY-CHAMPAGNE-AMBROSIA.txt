Title: MIXED-BERRY CHAMPAGNE AMBROSIA
Categories: Party
Yield: 6 Servings
-Dorothy Cross TMPJ72B
1/4 c  Honey; preferable berry-
-blossom honey
2 tb Fresh lime juice
2    Large sprigs fresh mint
6    Smaller sprigs for garnish
2 1/2 pt Mixed fresh berries; such
-as red or golden
-raspberries, blueberries,
-tiny strawberries,
-blackberries, pitted Bing
-or Queen Anne cherries
2 c  Chilled Champagne; or other
-sparkling white wine
In a small saucepan, combine the honey, lime juice and large mint
sprigs; warm over low heat just until the honey melts. Remove from
the heat and let steep for 5 minutes; discard the mint. Place the
fruit in a large bowl, pour the honey mixture over and stir gently to
combine. Divide the berry mixture among 6 individual goblets or
dessert dishes and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 1 hour.
Just before serving, pour the Champagne over the fruit. Garnish each
serving with a sprig of mint and serve. Serves 6.

COMMENTS: Nonalcoholic champagne, such as Ariel Brut, can be
substituted for the real thing. Any combination of berries or
cherries (or nectarines or peaches, for that matter) can be used.
Several colors make the prettiest presentation, but single-berry
ambrosia is delicious too.
