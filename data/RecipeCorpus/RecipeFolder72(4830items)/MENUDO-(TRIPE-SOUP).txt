Add salt to taste.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer
about 6 hours or until tripe is tender.  After 1 hour, skim foam from
surface of soup. Skim again as needed.  Add more water if liquid

during last hour of cooking. Ladle into large bowls. Serve chopped
green onions, cilantro, lemon wedges and hot corn tortillas

saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil. Continue to boil until
chiles are softened, about 5 minutes. Drain; discard water. Place

remove bits of peel. Makes about 1 cup. Variation: Substitute 1 1/2
cups nixtamal (cooked dried corn) for canned hominy.  Combine with
soaked tripe and calf's foot, garlic, onion and water. Cook as
directed above.
