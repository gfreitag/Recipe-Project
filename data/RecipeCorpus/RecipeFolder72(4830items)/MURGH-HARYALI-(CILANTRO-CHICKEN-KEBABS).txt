Cut each breast in half lengthwise and then cut each half crosswise
into three or four equal pieces. Lay the pieces in a single layer on
a platter. Sprinkle the salt and the juice from the lemon over them
and rub into the chicken. Set aside for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, put
the yogurt in a small bowl. Beat it with a fork or whisk until it is
smooth and creamy. Add the ginger, garlic, cumin, cayenne, and garam
masala and besan. Stir into mix. Make a paste out of the green
chiles, cilantro and 1/4 cup of water in a food processor. Add the
paste to the yogurt mixture. After the chicken has sat around for 20
minutes, hold a sieve over the chicken pieces and pour the yogurt
mixture into the sieve and push through as much as you can with a
rubber spatula. Mix well with the chicken pieces and refrigerate for
6-24 hours, in an airtight container. Preheat over to maximum
temperature (best is to use the broiler). Thread the chicken pieces
on skewers. Brush the chicken with half the melted butter and put in
the over for about 7 minutes. Take out the baking tray and skewers.
Turn the chicken pieces over and brush with the rest of the butter.
Bake for another 8-10 minutes. Serve with thick slices of onions, and
cucumbers. Serves 4-6
