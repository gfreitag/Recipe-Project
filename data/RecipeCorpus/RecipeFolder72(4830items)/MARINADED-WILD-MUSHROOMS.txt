1 1/2 lb Mushrooms, fresh
3/4 c  Oil, any type
1/2 c  Vinegar, wine
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Sweet basil, dried
1/4 ts Thyme
6    Pepper corns
1    Garlic clove, halved
1    Bay leaf
Combine ingredients, cover and heat to boiling. Simmer for 10
minutes. Add mushrooms and simmer, uncovered, 3 minutes. Transfer to
a bowl, including liquid and chill overnight, stirring occasionally.
Drain and serve as a salad or appetizer. Many wild mushrooms are
poisonous, either mildly or fatally. Use only those you know or buy
some. Willow mushrooms, called oyster mushrooms in Louisiana, occur
in late fall/winter on sides of dead willows and are ideal for this
dish. Recipe date: 12/12/87
