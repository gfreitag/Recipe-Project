This one comes from the Japanese consulate, but is obviously not a
traditional Japanese dish.  It uses cream, butter, thyme and white
pepper++not traditional Japanese ingredients.

From Hisashi Vakada, Japanese Consulate.

Saute the vegetables in a small amount of oil.  Season with salt and
pepper.  Set aside.

Cut the monkfish into 4 pieces, one for each person. Season fish with
salt and pepper; dip into a little flour and shake lightly. Put the
butter in a baking pan, add the fish, and bake in a 350F oven for
about 10 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.

Combine wine and fish stock in a saucepan.  Place over medium-high
heat and reduce until only a small amount of liquid remains in the
bottom of the pan, turn off the heat. Add heavy cream. Cook over low
heat for 3 to 5 minutes.  Add vegetables.  Drain ginger and add to
sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over fish
before serving.

Serves 4.

FISH STOCK:

Melt the butter in a stockpot; add fish bones and saute. Be careful
bones don't stick or burn.  Add onion slices and white wine. Turn
heat to high. Reduce liquid by half, skimming the top to remove
residue.

Turn the heat to low.  Add water and herbs.  Simmer for 2 to 3
minutes. Strain and reserve the stock. Discard bones.
