minutes.

On lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness.

dough to patch any tears in pastry. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Prick

minutes.

Filling: In top of double boiler over hot (not boiling) water, heat

almost boiling. Remove from heat; stir in chocolate until melted and
smooth. Blend in remaining cream. Pour into pastry shell; refrigerate
for 1 hour or until set.

Topping: In small heavy saucepan, cook sugar over medium-high heat
until melted and golden brown. Immediately plunge bottom of pan into
cold water for 15 seconds. Working quickly, dip 2 of the hazelnuts
into sugar and place on foil-lined baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining hazelnuts. Let cool. Place around edge of pie.
