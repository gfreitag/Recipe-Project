MMMMM----------------------FOR THE GARNISH---------------------------
2 c  Sesame seeds; toasted
Seeded, deveined, roasted or lightly fried, and soaked. Reserve some
of the soaking water or water/vinegar mixture.

Prepare the spices: Heat a little lard in a large, deep saucepan.
Fry halved onion until transparent and lightly browned. Add garlic
cloves, and brown. Remove garlic. Reserve. Add more lard, and fry
sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, raisins, prunes, plantains, coriander
seed, anise, and cinnamon. Remove. Drain all fried ingredients on
paper towels. Put fried ingredients, croissant, tortillas, and broth
in a blender or food processor, and blend thoroughly. It will be
necessary to blend in batches.
Heat remaining lard, and brown onion slices.  Add blended
ingredients and salt.  Simmer over low heat for 1 hour, stirring
occasionally.
Meanwhile, prepare the chiles: Blend chiles mulatos, anchos,
pasillas, and chipotle in a blender or food processor with onion,
garlic, and a little reserved soaking water. Salt. Strain chile
mixture, and gruadually stir into the simmering spice mixture,
waiting about 10 minutes between each addition. Continue to heat
mole, stirring occasionally. Add chocolate and sugar.  Add salt if
necessary.
Simmer mole for 2 to 3 hours.  Cover saucepan with lid or aluminum
foil to avoid splattering.  The mole also can be prepared outdoors on
a brazier to avoid splattering or over firewood, which gives the
sauce a rustic flavor.  Add broth until the mole is slightly thick.
The mole is ready when it is very thick, with a thick top layer of
fat. Taste, and add more salt if necessary.
Prepare the chicken: Heat water in a large stock pot. Add chicken,
onions, garlic, carrots, celery, bay leaves, and salt. Cook over low
heat for 30 minutes. Cool chicken in broth. Then add chicken pieces
to the mole sauce, and cook for 30 minutes.
Serve mole, garnished with toasted sesame seeds, from a clay pot,
or serve on individual plates, sprinkling sesame seeds over the
mole-covered chicken. This dish often is served with red rice,
frijoles de oila, and freshly made tortillas.
This mole recipe will yild more sauce than necessary for one meal.
Use extra sauce to accent fried or poached eggs or in stuffings for
enmoladas, mole-chicken pie, or chicken crepes with cheese and cream.
It is an excellent complement to rice.  The mole sauce freezes well.
