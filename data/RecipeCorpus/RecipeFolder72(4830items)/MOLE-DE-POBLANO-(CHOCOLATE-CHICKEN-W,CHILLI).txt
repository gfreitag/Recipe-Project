Recipe by: Bernard Salmon <li899sab@kauri.vuw.acupnz> Put the chicken
pieces in a pan with the onions and garlic, cover withwater bring to
the boil and simmer for 30 minutes or 'til the chicken is almost
cooked. Drain off and reserve the stock, and dry the chicken pieces.
Melt the lard in a heavy based pan and gently fry the chicken pieces
on all side 'til they are lightly tanned.

Meanwhile, remove the stems and seeds from the chilis, tear them up
and soak the pieces in 300ml boiling water for 30 minutes. Then, in a
liquidiser, puree the chilis with their water, the onions, garli
tomatoes, nuts and seeds, spices, seasoning and chocolate. Remove the
chicken pieces from the pan and pour off any excess fat. Fry the
puree in the remaining lard for a few minutes, then add the meat with
enough of the chicken stock for the sauce just to cover the meat, and
continue to simmer gently for 30 minutes, or 'til the chicken is
thoroughly cooked. Ideally the mole should be put aside for 24 hours
at this point to allow th flavours to develop.

When you are ready to serve the mole, reheat it, adjust the seasoning
to taste, and add a little sugar if you feel it necessary. Serve it
with plent of tortillas, white rice, beans and guacamole.

Serves 6.
