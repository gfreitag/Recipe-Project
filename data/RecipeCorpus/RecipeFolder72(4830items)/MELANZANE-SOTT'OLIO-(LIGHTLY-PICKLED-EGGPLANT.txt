Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Quart
2 lb Japanese eggplant
4 c  Red wine vinegar
4 c  Water
1 tb Coarse salt
30 ea Fresh mint leaves
5 lg Garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
2 c  Olive oil, or as needed
Peel the eggplants & cut them into 1/4" thick slices. Bring the
vinegar, water & salt to a boil in a heavy saucepan. In the boiling
liquid, immerse as many of the eggplant slices as possible in one
layer. Lower the heat to a simmer & set a weighted plate on top of
the eggplant to keep it submerged.  Cook for about 10 minutes, until
it is soft & easily pierced. Remove with a slotted spoon. Repeat with
the remaining slices of eggplant. If the liquid becomes too
concentrated, add 1 c more of both water & vinegar. Arrange a layer
of eggplant slices in a glass bowl. Sprinkle with some mint, garlic &
red pepper flakes. Repeat until all the layers are used up & cover
with olive oil. Cover & allow to marinate at room temperature for 2
days. Serve as part of an antipasto or with any salad. VARIATION:

it should be just piercable by a knife but not soft. Drain well &
proceed as above.
