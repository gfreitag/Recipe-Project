Title: OATMEAL BREAD (2 LOAVES)
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Quick oats
2 c  Boiling water
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 pk (1*scant*Tablespoon) yeast
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Warm water
1 tb Salt
5 c  White flour
Combine oats, whole wheat flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, and
pour the boiling water over it.  Stir to combine.

Meanwhile, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.

When the oat mixture is lukewarm, add the yeast.  Stir in the white
flour, cup by cup.

When dough is stiff enough to handle, turn onto floured board and
knead 5-10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, cover, and let rise until
doubled. Punch down and let rise again. Shape into 2 loaves and place
in greased 9x5x3" pans.  Bake at 350 F for 30-40 minutes. Cool on
rack.

[Notes:  This originally called for 2 T. margarine to be added to the
initial oat mixture.  Oil is unnecessary in bread, but it does delay
staleness.  I usually use half white flour and half wheat. This bread
is VERY good, and makes great toast.]
