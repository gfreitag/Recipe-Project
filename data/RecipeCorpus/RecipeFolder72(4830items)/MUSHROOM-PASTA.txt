WIPE MUSHROOMS TO REMOVE any dirt. Slice chanterelles and cultivated
mushrooms, trim and discard the stems of shiitake mushrooms or root
tips of oyster mushrooms. Bring 4 quarts of cold, salted water to a
boil over high heat. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat
and add the mushrooms, garlic, shallots and salt. Cook, stirring, for
15 minutes. Add sherry, increase the heat to high. Cook 2 minutes.
Add cream. Cook until liquid reduces to a sauce-like consistency and
is thick enough to coat a spoon. Remove from heat. Keep warm until
pasta cooks. Add pasta to the boiling water, cook until desired
doneness, drain and toss with mushroom sauce. Place on a serving
platter or in a large serving bowl and serve immediately. Offer
grated cheese.
