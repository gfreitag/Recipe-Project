Title: MOJO (GARLIC CIRTRUS SAUCE)
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 c  Olive oil
6 ea To 8 cloves garlic, thinly
-sliced or minced
2/3 c  Fresh sour orange juice or
-lime juice
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper, to taste
Note: Sour orange juice can be found in Latino markets. Heat the
olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and
cook until fragrant and lightly toasted but not brown, about 30
seconds. Add the sour orange juice, cumin, and salt and pepper. Stand
back: The sauce may sputter. Bring the sauce to a rolling boil.
Correct the seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste. Cool before
serving. Mojo tastes best when served within a couple of hours of
making, but it will keep for several days, covered, in the
refrigerator. (The name means Moors and Christians, a reference to
the North Africans who once dominated Spain. This traditional dish is
a peaceful co-mingling of textures. To eat it, ladle the cooked beans
over a bed of fluffy rice and garnish with chopped scallions.) MOJO
