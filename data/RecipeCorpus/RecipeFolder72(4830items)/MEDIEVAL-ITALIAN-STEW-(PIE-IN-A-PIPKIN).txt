Title: MEDIEVAL ITALIAN STEW (PIE IN A PIPKIN)
Categories: Beef, Fruits, Harned 1994, Italian, Stews
Yield: 1 Batch
3 lb Stew beef; cut in 1/2" cubes
2 md Onions; chopped
Cooking oil
1/2 c  Raisins
1/4 ts Each cloves and cinnamon
1/4 ts Each nutmeg, mace and pepper
1 tb White vinegar; or to taste
Salt; to taste
Brown the beef in a skillet in a small quantity of oil. Place browned
beef *and its juices* in a stewpot. Add more oil (if necessary) to
the skillet; saute onions until tender and translucent.  Add onions
to stewpot. Add raisins and spices to the meat mixture, along with a
small quantity of water (approximately 1/2 cup). There should be just
enough water to prevent scorching and to help form the gravy.

Bring stew to a boil and reduce immediately to a simmer. Simmer,
covered, until meat is tender (about 1-1/2 to 2 hours). Stir
occasionally. Add water as necessary. When beef is cooked, add
vinegar and salt. Cook a few minutes more.

translation of a medieval Italian cookbook. The recipe is called "Pie
in a Pipkin" which means (crustless) meat pie in a stewpot. It has a
nice thick gravy and a sweet/tart flavor."
