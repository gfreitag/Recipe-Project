Yield: 8 Servings
2 1/2 c  ;Water, lukewarm
1 pk Yeast, dry
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Oil
3/4 ts Salt
4 c  Flour, unbleached
2 c  Flour, whole wheat
1/2 c  Onion; minced
1 ts Garlic; minced
Approx. Cook Time: 3:00 In a
large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the water, the yeast, and sugar and
let stand until foamy; about 5 minutes. Add the rest of the water,
the oil, and the salt, then gradually add four cups of the unbleached
flour and all of the whole wheat flour, one cup at a time, mixing
well after each addition with a wooden spoon. Transfer the dough to a
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes,
adding enough of the remaining unbleached flour to prevent sticking.
Shape the dough into a ball, place in a buttered bowl and turn to
coat. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft- free
place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough into
eight pieces and shape each piece into a ball. On a floured surface
with a floured rolling pin, roll out each ball into a round about
seven inches in diameter. With a pastry brush, brush each round with
cold water. Cover with a towel and let stand 30 minutes. Meanwhile,
preheat the oven to 500 F. (yes, five hundred). Place a heavy-duty
baking sheet in the oven to heat for 15 minutes. Wet your hands in
cold water and make an indentation in the center of each dough round
about two inches in diameter. With a fork, prick all over the
indentation in a circular fashion. Sprinkle with the onion and
garlic. Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the
rounds lightly with cold water and place on the baking sheet. Bake in
the lowest part of the oven until the breads are light golden and
baked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, wrap in a
clean, damp kitchen towel, and let rest for 10 minutes.
