Dissolve yeast in water. Mix in 2 cups of the flour, butter, milk,

stiff dough. Turn onto a floured board and knead until smooth. Put in
a greased bowl, turn the dough over and cover with a clean cloth. Put
bowl in a warm place with no drafts and let dough rise until doubled
- about one hour.

Combine for filling. Punch dough down and roll into a 20" x 8"
rectangle. Cut into four 20" x 2" strips. Spread filling on each
strip and fold over lengthwise. Twist two strips together then twist
double strips together and form in a circle on a greased cookie
sheet. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise until doubled. Brush
with beaten egg and sprinkle with chile powder. Bake at 350 Deg F for
40 minutes.
