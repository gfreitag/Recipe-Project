Title: MAYAPPLE JELLY
Categories: Canning, Fruits, Harned 1994, Jam/jelly, Wild foods
Yield: 1 Batch
1 3/4 c  Mayapple juice; strained
1/8 c  Lemon juice
3 1/2 c  Sugar
3 oz Liquid fruit pectin
Wash ripe mayapples, cut away the stem and blossom ends, and any waste
parts.  Cut the fruit into pieces and place in a large kettle with
water to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer until mayapples are
tender, mashing during cooking.  Strain the juice through a
cheesecloth or let it drip through a jelly bag.

To the strained mayapple juice, add lemon juice and sugar. Bring the
mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, then stir in pectin. Again
bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and boil hard until the jelly
stage is reached.  Remove jelly from heat, skim, and pour into hot,
sterilized jelly glasses.  Seal at once with hot paraffin.

Double the recipe if you have plenty of mayapple juice. The amount
used in this recipe is the yield of about 2 cups of sliced mayapples
simmered in 3 cups of water.

Yield: Four small glasses of pale amber jelly with an almost tropical
flavor.

Serve mayapple jelly on hot breads or for a dessert with cream cheese
and soda crackers.

Note:  While  the author says to seal the jars with paraffin, I think
this method is no longer recommended by canning experts, and I'd
process in a hot water bath instead.
