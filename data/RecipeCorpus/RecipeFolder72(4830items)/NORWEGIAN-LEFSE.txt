There are many different types of this flat bread. This version should
remain soft rather than crisp (hence the name lefse, or soft cake).
PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. In a large bowl, combine water, butter, salt,
rye flour and all-purpose flour and beat well. Stir in whole wheat
flour and beat until you have a smooth dough that resembles dough for
a baking powder biscuit. Divide dough into 4 parts. Cut each portion
into quarters. Flour a board and roll each piece of dough to make a
thin 10- to 12-inch circle. If desired, use lefse rolling pin to make
a pattern on the dough. Place 2 or 3 dough circles on ungreased
baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven 3 to 5 minutes--NOT until
completely browned. Cool on a rack. Wrap airtight.
