Place fruits in the bottom of a lightly buttered 9 x 12-inch glass or
enamel baking dish.

In a separate bowl, mix the sugar, oats, flour, cheese and salt
together. With a hand mixer or with your fingertips, quickly mix
butter bits into sugar mixture to form a coarse meal. Mixture should
be loose and crumbly, work quickly to avoid melting the butter.

Gently sprinkle topping mixture over fruit and bake in a preheated 375
degree oven until the top is lightly browned and fruits are bubbling,
about 35 minutes depending on fruit. Serve warm with a scoop of
Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.

Yield: 8-9 servings
