COOKBOOK. To make fruit sweetner - cook four cups of fruit juice
until it is reduced to one cup. If you like it sweeter add Sweet One.
OR if a recipe calls for 1/2 cup fruit sweetner, use 1/2 cup frozen
fruit juice plus half as much (1/4 cup) granulated fructose. ~ Sherry
adds Sweet One instead to desired sweetness. If 2/3 cup is called for
use 2/3 cup concentrate plus 1/3 cup granulated fructose. Commercial
fruit sweeteners are available at health food stores. Good juices to
use are apple, orange, pineapple, pineapple- orange, and grape.
