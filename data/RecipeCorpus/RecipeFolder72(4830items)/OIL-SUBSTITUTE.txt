Title: OIL SUBSTITUTE
Categories: Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  Arrowroot Powder
The best substitute for the oil seems to be a tablespoon of arrowroot
mixed in a couple cups of water and boiled until it thickens to
oil-like consistency.  (I got the "arrowroot for oil" substitution
from Graham Kerr.)
