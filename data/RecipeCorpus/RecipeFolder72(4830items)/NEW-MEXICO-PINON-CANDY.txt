Piloncillo is unrefined sugar that is purchased in hard cones. It
comes in colors from beige to brown.

Heat piloncillo and water to boiling in 2-quart saucepan, stirring
constantly. Reduce heat slightly. Cook, without stirring, to 236F on
candy thermometer or until small amount of mixture dropped into very
cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from water.
Remove from heat. Immediately remove thermometer. Stir in butter.
Cool 8 minutes without stirring. Stir in pine nuts and vanilla. Beat
with spoon until slightly thickened and mixture just coats pine nuts
but remains glossy, about 1 minute. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto
waxed paper. Let stand until candies are firm. Store tightly covered
at room temperature.
