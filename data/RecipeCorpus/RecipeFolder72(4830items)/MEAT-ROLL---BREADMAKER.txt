The following is in the introduction to the chapter of this book
headed Pizza, Meat Pies, & Hand Pies.  If you have a Panasonic SDBT6P
or a National SDBT6N you may make some of these breads on the Variety
Bread Cycle.  This cycle enables you to remove the dough, place
fillings into it and replace it into the machine for baking. Follow
the directions given in your owner's manual.....
Owners of all other machines should make the recipes on the dough
setting, remove, fill according to following directions and bake (in
your conventional oven). A small amount of flour may be used when
rolling dough ro prevent if from sticking.
To make the meat filling:  Cut cheese into 1-inch cubes and mix
together with cooked, drained but still hot meats. Cheese should warm
enough to serve as the "glue" for the filling. If cheese is not
melting into meat, warm in microwave for a minute or two.  Roll as
jelly-roll or stromboli... For jelly-roll - remove dough from machine
and roll into a rectangle. Spread filling on top. Starting from wide
end, roll dough jelly-roll fashine to encase filling, pince ends
closed, - place on a nonstick bakin pan and let rise for 1/2
hour.....OR For Stromboli - remove dough from machine and roll into a
rectangle.  Spread filling ingredients over the middle third of the
rectangle so it runs the lenght of the wide end. Fold one side over
top of the filling and then the other sideon top ot that; pinch ends
closed.  Place, seam side down, on a lightly buttered baking sheet,
cover and let rise for about 30 minutes. Lightly olive oil top....
Bake either way in a preheated 350 oven for 20 to 25 minutes.....
