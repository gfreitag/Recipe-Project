Recipe from Jigme Topgyal, a Tibetan.

In his native Tibet, these would be made with a flour ground from
roasted barley called "Tsampa". The [alternate] filling usually is
made with ground chicken mashed with onions, daikon, fresh ginger,
garlic and cilantro. [A] Vegetarian filling contains chopped cabbage,
bok choy, tofu, green onion, ginger and garlic.
