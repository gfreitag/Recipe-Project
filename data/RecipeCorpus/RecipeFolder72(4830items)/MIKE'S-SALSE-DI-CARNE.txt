Title: MIKE'S SALSE DI CARNE
Categories: Italian, Beef, Main dish
Yield: 1 Serving
2 T  Olive oil
1 md Onion, finely chopped
2 md Carrots, finely chopped
2 ea Celery stalks, finely choped
3 ea Cloves garlic, pressed
1 T  Dried parsley
1 lb Lean ground beef
2 T  All purpose flour
1 cn Campbell's Beef Broth 10 1/2
-oz plus equal amount water
Freshly ground black pepper
-and salt to taste
I first process the carrots in the food processor to get them really
chopped finely.  Then process the onion and celery to a course fine
chop. Heat the oil in a large sauce pan and saute the onion, carrots,
celery, garlic and parsley. When they start to soften, add the ground
beef and fry until the meat browns.  Then stir in the soup, water,
salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered gently for an hour or so.  Watch
the liquid content of the sauce.  The sauce should thicken but still
retain a little of the moisture. When ready to serve, thicken the
sauce with the 2 plus or minus tablespoons of flour to make it thick
and sticky. Can be served over any spaghetti or linguini, but best
IMHO served over or on the side with Mike's Capellini with Garlic.
