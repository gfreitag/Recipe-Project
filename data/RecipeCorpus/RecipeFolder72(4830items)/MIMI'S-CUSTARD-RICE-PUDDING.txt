1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

baking dish with about 1 tsp. unsalted butter.

3. Beat eggs into milk and strain through sieve into mixing bowl.
Stir in all the remaining ingredients except cinnamon or nutmeg and
cream. Pour into buttered baking dish and smooth top until level.

4. Place baking dish in slightly larger baking pan. Pour in enough
boiling water to come halfway up the sides of baking dish. Bake in
preheated oven for 30 minutes. Stir pudding gently so that rice and
raisins are distributed evenly throughout. Continue baking for
30    minutes, then stir again.

5. Carefully smooth top of pudding until level, then sprinkle with

pudding is set, adding more boiling water to baking pan if needed to
maintain level. Lift pudding from water bath and cool at room
temperature. Serve slightly warm or well chilled. Sweet cream can be
poured over individual protions arranged in saucers.
