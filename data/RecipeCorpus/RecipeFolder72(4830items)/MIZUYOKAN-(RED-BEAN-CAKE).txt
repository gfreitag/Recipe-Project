12 oz Azuki beans - cooked
2 pk Gelatin, unflavored
1 1/4 c  Sugar, granulated

1. PREPARE AHEAD: Place the drained, cooked beans in a 4 quart pot.
Add 2 quarts of cold water and, over high heat, bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to its lowest point and cook uncovered for about 3
hours, or until the beans are very soft.

2. Pour the beans into a coarse sieve set over a large bowl and puree
them by rubbing them through with the back of a large spoon. Transfer
the puree to a very fine sieve set over another bowl, and rub them
through again.

3. Wrap the pureed beans in a kitchen towel and twist to squeeze them
dry. The beans may be refrigerated, tightly wrapped in the towel, for
as long as
1    week.

4. TO COOK: In a 1-1/2 to 2 quart saucepan, stir together the gelatin,
sugar and salt. Pour in 2 cups of cold water and bring to a boil over
moderate heat, stirring constantly. Add the pureed beans and return
to a boil, still stirring. Then pour the beans into an 8" cake pan,
cool and refrigerate overnight or until firm. Slice into 2" wedges
and serve as dessert or a swee course.
