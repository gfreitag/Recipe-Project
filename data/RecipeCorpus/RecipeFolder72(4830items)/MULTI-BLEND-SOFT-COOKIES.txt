Title: MULTI BLEND SOFT COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Batch
4 1/2 c  AM Multi Blend Flour
2 pk Dry active yeast
1 ts Sea salt (optional)
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Honey (or less to taste)
2 1/2 c  Warm water
2 tb Apple cider vinegar
1/4 c  AM Unrefined Vegetable Oil
1 c  Raisins
Combine flour, yeast, cinnamon and salt in mixing bowl. Combine
vinegar, oil, honey, water and raisins in a second bowl. Add liquid
mixture to dry and mix thoroughly. Batter will become quite stiff,
but should not be dry. If dry, add a little water.  Drop on cookie
sheet. Spread cookies out (they spread very little in baking). Bake
in 350 F. oven about 15-20 minutes or until done.  Makes 4-6 dozen.

Yeast-Free Variation: Substitute a tablespoon of baking powder for the
yeast.  Use cool, but not warm water.
