Title: MOM'S BAKED BEANS
Categories: Entrees, Legumes, Mom
Yield: 4 Servings
Ham chunks (or bacon)
Ketchup (or tomato paste)
Mustard
Onions, pearl
Liquid smoke
Brown sugar
Pork and beans (canned)
To lots of ham chunks, add some ketchup, a little mustard, and plenty
of onions.  Add several dashes of liquid smoke and some brown sugar,
also the canned beans. Might need a little vinegar and salt. Mix in
pan; should be pretty soupy.  Bake at 325 degrees until done, about
an hour.

Vicki's note:  Use the leftover sauce from her ginger-barbecued
chicken.
