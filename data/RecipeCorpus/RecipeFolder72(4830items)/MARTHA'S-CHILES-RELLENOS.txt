Categories: Ethnic, Tex-mex, Dairy
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  Monterey Jack cheese
1 x  Whole chiles; fresh or cannd
MMMMM------------------FOR EVERY 2 CHILES ALLOW-----------------------
1 ea Egg;separated
1 tb Flour
1 x  Oil-1 1/2" deep in skillet
MMMMM-----------------RANCHERO SAUCE-SEE RECIPE----------------------
Cut the cheese into oblong pieces about an inch wide and 2 inches
long, and place inside the peeled chiles. (see note following
directions) Beat the eggwhites until stiff. Beat the yolks in a
separate bowl, combining with the flour. Lightly fold the yolk
mixture into the whites. Drop the peppers into the mixture, one by
one. Heat the oil in the skillet to moderately hot, then picking the
chiles up with a spoon, place them in the pan, and fry until golden
brown on both sides. Serve piping hot, topped with Ranchero Sauce.
(recipe to be posted) Note: If you are using fresh chiles, they must
be peeled, as the batter will not adhere to the slick skins of the
chiles. Do this by charring the chiles either over an open flame or
under the broiler. Then steam them in a hot towel, and when they are
cool enough to touch, remove the skins. I got this recipe from Martha
Campbell, a mexican senorita who had married a friend of ours, and
was our neighbor back in the '50s. She was an excellent cook, and
gave me many fine recipes. Chile Rellenos are often made with other
stuffings than cheese. I have other recipes where they are stuffed
with meat, sardines, rice, and a combination of meat and vegetables.
Martha often made this same recipe using bell peppers. Actually, any
pepper and almost any stuffing can be used, according to your
personal tastes. Whatever cheese or other stuffing you choose, they
are delicious! -----Barb
