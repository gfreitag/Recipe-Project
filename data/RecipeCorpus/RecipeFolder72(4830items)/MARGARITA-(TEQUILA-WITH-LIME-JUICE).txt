Title: MARGARITA (TEQUILA WITH LIME JUICE)
Categories: Mexico, Beverages
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Lime slice
Salt, coarse (kosher)
1/2 oz Lime juice
1 1/2 oz Tequila
1/2    Tripe sec
4    Ice cubes
1. Rub the inside rim of a 4 oz chilled tumber with the slice of
lime. Pour salt into a saucer or cup and dip in the glass so that a
thin layer of salt adheres to the moistened rim.

2. Combine the lime juice, Tequila, Triple Sec and ice cubes in a
mixing glass and place a bar shaker on top. Grasping the glass and
shaker firmly together with both hands, shake them vigorously 9 or 10
times. Remove the shaker, place a strainer on top of the mixing
glass, and pour the Margarita into the salt-rimmed tumbler or
cocktail glass.
