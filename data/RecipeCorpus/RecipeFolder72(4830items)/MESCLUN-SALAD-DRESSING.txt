Title: MESCLUN SALAD DRESSING
Categories: Salads, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Mesclun greens
1    Garlic clove
1    Shallot; chopped
2 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Olive oil
Just as the ingredients in your salads will change with the seasons,
your dressing should vary according to the greens. Milder greens such
as mache are best with a light coating of good olive oil and lemon or
vinegar. The best dressing is one that highlights the greens, not
itself. You may want to add a tablespoon of plain yogurt to a basic
vinaigrette, this will tame the sharper greens.

DIRECTIONS:

1.) Rub salad bowl with garlic.

2.) Mix shallots, mustard, vinegar in bowl.

3.) Pour in olive oil, whisking until blended.  Add mesclun leaves and
toss.
