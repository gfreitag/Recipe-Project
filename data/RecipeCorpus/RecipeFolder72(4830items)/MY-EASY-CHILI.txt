the onions are limp, add the beef, and brown, breaking up with a
spoon. (Drain if you like). Add puree, paste, chili powder if you
didn't brown it, beans, and 16 oz. water. And salt & pepper if you
like it. Cover and simmer over low heat for 2 hrs., stirring
occasionally.
Add more water if it gets too thick. Good served over mashed
potatoes. You may need more water, depending on the cooking
temperature. And you can adjust the amount of chili powder to taste.
And you can add spices of your choice. This is an easy dish for
camping.
