Title: NEVER FAIL SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Hot water
2 tb Honey or sugar
2 tb Butter or margarine
1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter
4 c  (to 6) flour
1 x  Cake yeast
2 ts Salt(optional)
Mix hot water, honey or sugar, butter or margarine in a large ceramic
mixing bowl. Cool to lukewarm and add yeast, sourdough starter, salt
and flour a cup at a time enough to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto
a floured board and knead for 5 to 8 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl
and cover; let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down and let rise
for 30 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured board and let sit ten
minutes. Form into long or round loaf, or into rolls and place in a
well greased pan or cookie sheet and let rise again until doubled.
Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 45 to 55 minutes or until
brown. Makes 1 large loaf or 8 to 12 rolls. SUGGESTIONS: The bread
will rise more quickly if salt is omitted. Use only ceramic or wood
bowls and utensils as metal spoils sourdough.(I use a large
corningware bowl and a plastic whip to mix, then rinse and reuse same
bowl to let kneaded ball rise in). Wash utensils promptly as this
stuff sets up like cement when left to dry!  This recipe will make 4
thin baguette loaves, two small regular loaves or one MONSTER loaf in
a regular bread pan. Grease pans generously with crisco or other
shortening. From The Dough Boys Bakery in San Francisco
