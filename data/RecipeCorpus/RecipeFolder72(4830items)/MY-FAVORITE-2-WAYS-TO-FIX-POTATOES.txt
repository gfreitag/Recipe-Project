Title: MY FAVORITE 2 WAYS TO FIX POTATOES
Categories: Digest, July
Yield: 1 Servings
None
1) Slice them up, put on a cookie sheet, and bake at 450. After about
15 minutes, flip them over, sprinkle on desired seasonings (I like
dill and oregano) and continue to bake. Keep flipping as desired (I
flip often because they stick).  When they're brown, you've got
delicious, hot potato chips. I even eat these for dinner sometimes
when I'm lazy. Also, they puff up really neat.

2) Wash and cube 2 or 3 potatoes (for 1 person, with leftovers). Heat
potatoes in a skillet with some water. After about five to ten
minutes, add more water (enough to let it steam for a while) and
frozen peas (I add up to half a package, because I really like them),
cover and let steam for 5 to 10 minutes. Add curry powder or garam
masala, mix, and continue cooking until potatoes are soft enough.
Add more water (or even better, broth) if need be.  I grind some
pepper in, too.

This is really good wrapped in a flour tortilla the next day, with or
without a little rice and/or black beans.
