Title: NEW ZEALAND LAMB
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Boneless leg of lamb
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  Oil
1/2 c  White wine
1 ts Crushed garlic
1 ts Salt
1 ts Dried rosemary
1 ts Pepper
1 tb Red pepper flakes
Marinate in the fridge for a good long while.  A week isn't too long.
Grill in a Webber kettle with the lid on and the vents almost closed,
15-20 minutes on each side.

A leg of lamb is great for a crowd.  Because the thickness is quite
uneven, some parts will be well done while others are medium rare.
Who says you can't please all the people all the time!
