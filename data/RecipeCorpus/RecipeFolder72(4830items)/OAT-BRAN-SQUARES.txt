Title: OAT BRAN SQUARES
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 55 Servings
1 1/2 c  Oat bran
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Baking soda
4 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1 ts Honey
1/4 c  Hot water
"Oat bran is a good source of fiber. These crackers are not only
healthy, they also taste good. They are worthy of a large glass of
freshly-squeezed orange juice.

18 to 22 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~ F.
325~ F

Combine the oat bran, flour, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl or
in the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal.

Dissolve the honey in the hot water and blend it into the flour
mixture. If the dough is too wet for rolling, quickly add a little
more flour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll to about 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife,
cut the dough into 2-inch squares. Place them on a lightly greased or
parchment-lined baking sheet. Prick each square in 2 or 3 places with
the tines of a fork. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until medium
brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 50-55.

VARIATIONS: Substitute wheat bran for oat bran. For a more delicate
cracker, roll the dough thinner and reduce the baking time to
compensate.
