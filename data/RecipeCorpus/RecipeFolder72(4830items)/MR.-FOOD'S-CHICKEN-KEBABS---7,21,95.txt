Title: MR. FOOD'S CHICKEN KEBABS - 7/21/95
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
2/3 c  Vegetable oil
2 tb White vinegar
1/2 ts Parsley, freeze-dried
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 1/4 lb Boneless skinless chicken
Breasts -- cut in 2" cubes
1    Medium-sized  red bell
Pepper -- cut in large
Chunks
1    Medium-sized  green bell
Pepper -- cut in large
Chunks
2    Medium-sized  onions -- cut
In large chunks
6    Metal or bamboo skewers
In a large bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, parsley, onion powder,
paprika, salt, and black pepper.  Add the remaining ingredients
(except the skewers) and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1-2
hours. Remove the chicken and vegetables from the marinade,
discarding excess marinade, and thread the chicken and vegetables
evenly on the skewers. If using bamboo skewers, they must first be
soaked in water for 15-20 minutes. Preheat the grill to medium-high
heat.  Place the kebabs across the grill rack and cook for 6-8
minutes or until the chicken is cooked and no pink remains, turning
halfway through.
