Title: MEYER LEMON CURD
Categories: Pies, Jams, Sauces, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Lemons; grated peel only
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  Sugar
3    Egg yolks
GRATE THE LEMON CAREFULLY, avoiding the white area under the skin,
which has a bitter flavor. Beat the egg yolks well and pour them
through a strainer into a small non-corrosive saucepan. Then add the
lemon peel, the lemon juice and the sugar. Cook over medium-low heat,
stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens. Take care not to let
it boil or the yolks will curdle. Set the lemon curd in the
refrigerator to cool. When cooled, use immediately or cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate. Makes 1 Pie
