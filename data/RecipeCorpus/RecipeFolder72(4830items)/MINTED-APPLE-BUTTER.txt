Title: MINTED APPLE BUTTER
Categories: Fruits, Low-cal
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Apples, cored, peeled
1/2 c  Water
1 tb Dry mint (3 tb chopped fresh
1 ts Ascorbic acid color keeper
Serve with ham, lamb, gingerbread, muffins, pancakes.

My note: Original directions called for apples to be chopped and
cooked with cores and peels. After discarding what looked like a lot
of applesauce stuck to the peel and picking bits of seeds out of my
teeth, I would suggest cooking the peels and cores separately to get
some apple juice.

Cook apples with water, mint and color keeper (sold with canning
supplies) in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, simmer about 15 min. until
apples are tender. Mash. Continue to simmer about 10 min until thick.
Press through a sieve or use a blender if you have already separated
the peel and cores.

Ladle into hot clean jars leaving 1 cm headspace. Wipe jar rims.
Process 10 min in boiling water bath. Store in a cool, dark, dry
place.
