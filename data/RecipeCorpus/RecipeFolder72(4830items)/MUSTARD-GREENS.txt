Title: MUSTARD GREENS
Categories: Vegetables, Southern
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Mustard greens
1/2 lb Bacon
1    Yellow onion
1/2 ts Pepper
2 tb Vinegar
Wash the greens carefully about 5 times (like spinach, they can hide
an incredible amount of grit) by soaking, then swishing in the water,
then shaking out above the water and checking for dirt in the water.
Repeat until there has been no grit twice. Now, a hand-sized clump at
a time, slice into thin strips (about 1/2 inches wide is fine).

Cook the bacon in a deep dish to render the fat. Remove the bacon and
saute the onion slices until they are just beginning to turn brown.
Add the sliced greens and stir over medium heat until they wilt, then
add the reserved bacon and cover the dish. When cooked, add pepper
and vinegar, then serve.

How long you allow mustard greens to cook is a matter of taste.
Traditionally, they are cooked to death (in excess of an hour). I
prefer them cooked for about 10-15 minutes after wilting. It is not
usually necessary to add water, but do not allow them to dry out.
There should be some "pot liquor" in the bottom when you're done,
which people normally fight over.
