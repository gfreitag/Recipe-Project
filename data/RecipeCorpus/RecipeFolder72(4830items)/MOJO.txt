Title: MOJO
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Cup
1/3 c  Olive oil
8    Garlic cloves, minced
2/3 c  Sour orange juice or lime
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
Salt and pepper, to taste
Heat the olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat.  Add the
garlic and cook until fragrant and lightly toasted but not brown,
about 30 seconds.

Add the sour orange juice, cumin, and salt and pepper.  The sauce may
spatter.  Bring sauce to a rolling boil.  Correct seasonings, adding
salt and pepper to taste.

Cool before serving.  Mojo tastes best when served within a couple of
hours of making, but it will keep for several days, covered, in the
refrigerator.
