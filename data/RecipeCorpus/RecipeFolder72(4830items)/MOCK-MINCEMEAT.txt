Categories: Preserves, Relishes, Pies, Vegetables
Yield: 10 Quarts
15 lb Green tomatoes

3 lb Raisins
1 c  Cider vinegar
12 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb Cinnamon

5 ts Salt
Wash, core and chop unpeeled green tomatoes.  Grind tomatoes in a food
processor, food mill or the old-fashioned way in a sausage grinder.
Drain through a colander lined with cheesecloth into a pan. Measure
juice after draining and discard. Place tomatoes in a large enamel or
stainless steel kettle; add a measurement of water equal to the
amount of discarded tomato juice. Bring mixture to a boil.  Remove
from heat and drain mixture as above. Measure juice and discard.
Return tomatoes to kettle, add water equal to amount of water
discarded. Bring to a boil and repeat draining process. Return
tomatoes to kettle and add amount of water equal to discarded tomato
juice. Wash, core and chop apples. Add apples, raisins, vinegar,
sugar, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and salt to tomato mixture. Cook
until thick (1 to 1 1/2 hours), stirring frequently. Mixture will
stick and burn quickly. Ladle hot mincemeat into hot sterilized jars,
leaving 1" headspace. Adjust caps.  Process 20 minutes in boiling
water bath. Note: This mincemeat can be used as a pie filling for
cakes, in cookies or eaten as you would jelly on biscuits, English
muffins or toast. It also makes a great topping for ice cream. One
quart of mincemeat is sufficient for a 9-inch pastry shell.
