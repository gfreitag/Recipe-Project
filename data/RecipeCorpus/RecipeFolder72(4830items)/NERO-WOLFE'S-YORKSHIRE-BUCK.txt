Categories: Main dish, Cheese, Eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Butter
1 lb Cheshire cheese, grated
1 c  Ale (not beer)
7 lg Eggs
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Dry mustard
2 ds Tabasco
6 sl Canadian back bacon
3    English muffins

Melt the butter in the top of a double boiler. Add the cheese and as
it begins to melt, add the ale slowly, stirring constantly. Beat 1 of
the eggs and add it, along with the salt, dry mustard, and Tabasco.
Continue to stir until the cheese is melted and the mixture is
smooth. Lower the heat and keep hot. Poach the remaining 6 eggs and
keep them warm while you fry the bacon on a griddle. Split and toast
the English muffins and spread them with a thin coating of Dijon
mustard. Put the muffins on a serving plate, pour on the cheese, and
top with a slice of bacon, a poached egg, and some more cheese. Serve
as hot as possible. Run the muffins under a hot broiler to glaze the
tops, if you like.
