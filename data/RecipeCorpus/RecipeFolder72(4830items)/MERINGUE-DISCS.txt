Categories: Desserts, June 1996 i
Yield: 16 Servings
Melted butter
Flour
5 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Almonds, blanched -- whole
4 lg Egg whites
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1 tb Cornstarch -- sifted
1 ts Cornstarch -- sifted
1/2 ts White vinegar -- distilled
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Trace 8 3 1/4-inch circles on
each; turn over. Lightly brush parchment with butter and dust with
flour. Tap off excess. In a food processor, process 5 1/2 tablespoons
sugar and almonds to a fine powder. Heat oven to 225 F. In electric
mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Increase speed to medium high; slowly add
remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Beat until glossy and firm, 5 minutes.
Reduce speed to low, sprinkle cornstarch over, and mix 15 to 20
seconds. Add vinegar; mix 15 to 20 seconds more. Fold in almond
mixture with a rubber spatula. Spread 1/4 cup of the mixture onto
each circle on parchment. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes, rotating pans
between shelves and reversing positions halfway through. Transfer
meringues, on parchment, to racks to cool.
