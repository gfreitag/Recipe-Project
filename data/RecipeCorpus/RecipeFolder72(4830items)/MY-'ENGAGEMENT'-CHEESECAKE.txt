MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
16    Graham crackers*
4 tb Butter
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 lb Cream cheese
1 pt Sour cream
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
1 ts Vanilla
2 tb Lemon juice; fresh is best
5    Eggs
1 pn Salt
*Could use Cinnamon Crisp Cookies instead.
Blend the sour cream and cream cheese well and add the egg yolks
(which have been beaten first) and the other ingredients. Whip egg
whites until stiff and fold cheese and yolk mixture in CAREFULLY.
Make sure it is all incorperated. Pour into a springform pan and bake
at 350 degrees for one hour. Then leave door closed for one hour; and
then oven door ajar for last5 hour (3 in all). Cake is creamy and
smooth and may crack a bit on top. Good reason to make a strawberry
topping.

This cake was given to Jeannie Toll by one of Mort's old girlfriends
about 37 years ago. She gave it to me when Mort and I told her about
our engaement...hence the title. Betty Mondress gave me her 'recipe'
card as mine dissappeared years ago. I used my copy of the LEVITTOWN
SISTERHOOD COOKBOOK; (Pa..circa 1957) until it disintegrated. Of
course i submitted it as my own...<G>. Ellen; did you know that? Mom
was 'bad'in her younger days!!!
