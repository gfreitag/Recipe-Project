12    Double graham crackers
14 oz Chocolate-covered caramel

crackers; set aside. In a saucepan, heat and stir the candies and
cream over low heat, until the candies melt. Spread the mixture over
the graham crackers then quickly sprinkle with nuts; p Note: If you
don't buy the pecans already toasted, it's easy to do yourself:
Spread them out on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees just until
lightly browned. (Keep an eye on them, 'cause it doesn't take too
long!) And if you'd rather use walnuts or p Microwave Method: Place
the candies & cream in a microwavable glass bowl. Microwave on a
