Title: OATCAKES (TRADITIONAL METHOD)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
4 oz Oatmeal
1 ts Fat
;Water, hot
1 pn Salt
1 pn Baking soda
As the dough stiffens when lying about, it is best to make a bannock
at a time, using the above quantities, the next being prepared whilst
the one is on the girdle [not a typo!].

Put the oatmeal into a bowl and add the salt and soda. Melt a
teaspoon of dripping or fat (bacon fat, goose fat, or poultry fat are
all excellent). Make a well in the centre of the meal, put in the
dripping, and add as much hot water as will make a stiff paste.  Rub
plenty of oatmeal on to the baking board; turn out the mixture and
form into a smooth ball. Knead and roll out as thinly as possible.
Rub constantly on both sides with dry meal to prevent sticking, and
keep the edges as even as possible by pinching wit finger and thumb.
Give a final rub with meal, cut into a round, using a plate, and then
cut the bannock into farls (fardels or quarters) or into smaller
pieces. Place on a moderately hot girdle and bake steadily till th
cakes curl up at the edge; then toast the other side slightly before
a clea fire or finish in the oven.

If you have neither a girdle nor a thick-bottomed frying-pan, you may
bake the oatcakes in a moderate over for 20-30 minutes, till quite
dry and curle at the edges.

Buttered oatcakes are particularly good with marmalade, honey,
cheese, frie herrings, and sardines.
