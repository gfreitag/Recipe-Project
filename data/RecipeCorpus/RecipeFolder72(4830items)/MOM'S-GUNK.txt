Title: MOM'S GUNK
Categories: Condiments, Mom
Yield: 1 Batch
2 c  Salt
1 1/2 c  Monosodium glutamate
1 c  Garlic powder
1 c  Paprika  (or more)
2 tb Mustard, dry
1 tb Ginger, powdered (heaping)
2 tb Black pepper (or less)
2 tb Oregano, ground
1 tb Thyme
1/2 pk Chili powder (optional)
Mix the ingredients roughly in a plastic bag; shake around. Pulverize
mixture in blender (mixes flavor better) in several small batches. (If
spices get hot, they lose their flavor.)

Note:  Can use 1/2 of a small package of chili powder when you are
short on paprika; gives a different, hot taste.
