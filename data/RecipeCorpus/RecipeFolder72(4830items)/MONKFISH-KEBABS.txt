Title: MONKFISH KEBABS
Categories: Fish, Barry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Monkfish
1    Red or 1 green pepper
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE MARINADE---------------------------
Juice of a lemon
4 tb Olive oil
1    Clove of garlic
Salt and Pepper
1 ts Freeze-dried rosemary or
-Fresh sprigs
Cut fish into 1 inch cubes. wash pepper and deseed it. Cut into 1 inch
pieces. To make marinade, mix olive oil, lemon juice, crushed clove of
garlic and rosemary in a glass or china bowl. Do not use metal. Add
salt and pepper. Put in fish, turning occasionally. Keep in marinade
in fridge for 90 minutes to 2 hours. It can stay in the marinade for
up to six hours, but not longer. When you're ready to cook kebabs,
put fish on to skewers, not more than 3 or 4 cubes on each skewer,
with pieces of pepper between each cube. Begin and end with pepper.
Make sure all the pieces touch, but don't squash together. Push all
up to sharp end, leaving a long handle to hold easily under grill or
on barbecue. Line grill with foil - saves washing up! - and grill for
5 to 6 minutes a side. Do not put them too close to the heat - they
will burn on the outside before they are cooked inside - these cubes
are really meaty. They should take about 10 to 12 minutes to cook
properly so they are succulent inside with wonderful borwn crispy
bits on the outside. Serve with a rice pilau or even just crusty
bread with some lemon juice to squeeze over them.
