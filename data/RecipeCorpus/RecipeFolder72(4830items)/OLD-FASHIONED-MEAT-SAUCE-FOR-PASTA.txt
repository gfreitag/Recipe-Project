Title: OLD FASHIONED MEAT SAUCE FOR PASTA
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 5 Quarts
12    Plum Tomatoes
1/2 c  Olive Oil
1 1/2 c  Shredded Parmesan
2 ts Oregano Leaves, Dry
2 ts Rosemary, Dry
1 ts Marjoram Leaves, Dry
1 ts Sweet Basil
2 ts Salt
2 tb Granulated Sugar
1    Whole Garlic, Minced
1 1/2 lb Ground Beef
2 c  Mushrooms, Sliced
1 c  Tomato Paste
Blanch & peel half the tomatoes. Place in a slow cooker with half of
the olive oil, the marjoram, rosemary, oregano, sugar, salt, sweet
basil and garlic. Slow simmer for 24 to 48 hours or until the tomato
solids are completely reduced. Blanch and peel the remaining
tomatoes, remove the seeds and puree. Add to the slow cooker along
with the tomato paste and continue to cook, very slowly, for another
24 hours. Saute the ground beef and add to the slow cooker along with
the remainder of the olive oil. Continue cooking for at least half a
day. During the last four hours of cooking, add the shredded parmesan
cheese and blend in well. Add the mushrooms 15 minutes or so before
serving. If you are planning meat balls, add them with the cheese and
remove before serving. Serve the sauce over or alongside the pasta.
