Title: NUTTY RICE PUDDING (INDIA)
Categories: Desserts, Rice
Yield: 8 Servings
INGREDIENTS
100 g  Rice
4 c  Whole milk
400 g  Sweetened condensed milk
Chopped nuts like walnuts,
Pistas, almonds
Raisins (optional)
1 pn Cardamom powder (optional)
Heat 1 tsp butter in a cooking dish and fry the rice until pale golden
brown. (I usually use Basmati rice for this, but you can use any
rice) Once the rice has fried, add milk and cook and the rice. This
will take 30 minutes, check and stir the rice and milk occasionally
and be careful not to burn the bottom of the vessel ( a
double-broiler works well here). After the rice is soft, add the
condensed milk and cook for another 7-10 mins stirring constantly
unti the pudding reaches the consistency you like best. Remove from
fire and serve garnished with nuts, cardamom powder and raisins. The
pudding can also be chilled and served cold. NOTES: If you like your
pudding to be more sweet, add a couple of teaspoons of sugar to taste
after you have added the condensed milk. Full-fat milk works best to
get a creamy, thick pudding, if you are calorie and fat conscious,
use skimmed milk to cook the rice. You can also use less or more of
rice in your pudding according to your taste and preference.
