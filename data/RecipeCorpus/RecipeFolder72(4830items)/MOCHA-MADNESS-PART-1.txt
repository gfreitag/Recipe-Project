COCOA POWDER Make the chocolate ice cream: Put the chocolate into a
medium bowl. In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir the yolks,
sugar and salt until blended. In a heavy medium saucepan, bring the
cream and milk to a gentle boil. Remove the pan from the heat.
Gradually whisk about 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the beaten
egg yolks until blended. Return this mixture to the saucepan.

Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a
wooden spoon, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the custard has thickened
slightly. Do not allow the custard to boil. Itis done when you can
run your finger down the back of the coated spoon and the path
remains in the custard. Immediately remove the pan from the heat, and
pour the custard over the chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds and
then whisk until smooth. Strain the chocolate custard through a
fine-meshed strainer into a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl over
a larger bowl of ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10 minutes,
or until cool. Remove the bowl from the ice water and stir in the
vanilla. Cover the surface of the custard with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for 2 hours, or until very cold.
