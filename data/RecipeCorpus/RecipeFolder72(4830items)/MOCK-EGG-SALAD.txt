Real egg salad contains quite a bit of fat from the egg yolk. This
version provides the egg salad taste and protein with almost no fat.
Serve it stuffed in a tomato on a lettuce leaf, or open-faced on
whole wheat toast, garnished with cucumber slices.

(ER Note:  try making one or two servings at a time and freeze extra
chick peas in meal-sized amounts.)

Coarsely mash chick peas.  Combine with dressing and other
ingredients. Mix until well blended.  Food processor may be used but
a coarse texture is more like a real egg salad.
