Title: MEATBALLS (SAME DAY)
Categories: Italian, Beef
Yield: 15 Servings
1 lb Ground chuck
3 ea While, smilin' eggs
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
1 x  Salt and pepper to taste
1 lb Ground pork
1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs*
4 ea To 6 garlic cloves*
1 x  Fresh Basil leaves***
* Or enough to hold the mixture together. Try to use leftover French
or Italian bread, and whole wheat crumbs work well also. ** Chopped
very fine *** If you have them on hand (GrandMa Rose always adds
fresh basil) YIELD: 15-18 medium meatballs, or 40-45 tiny meatballs.
Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Toss gently with your
hands until the meat has become thoroughly blended with all the
seasonings.
The mixture should be farily moist. 2.  To form the meatballs, wet
your hands in a small bowl of lukewarm water and then pick up about
1/3 cup of the meatball mixture. Roll it in the palm of your hands to
form a smooth ball about 1 inch in diameter. 3.  Drop the meatballs
directly into your basic tomato sauce recipe. Or, if you prefer a
crusty meatball, fry in approximately 3 tablespoons of olive oil on
med heat for about 5 min, turning to brown evenly.  Then drop them
into gently boiling tomato sauce as they are browned. Meatballs take
about 20 min to cook well. (Remember to scrape the bottom of skillet
and pour meat particles into sauce.)
