Title: MOP FOR ALL BARBEQUE MEATS
Categories: Sauces, Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 tb Salt
1 1/2 tb Dry mustard
1 tb Garlic powder
1/2 tb Ground bay leaf
1 tb Chili powder
1 1/2 tb Paprika
1 tb Louisiana Hot Sauce
1 pt Worcestershire sauce
1/2 pt Vinegar
2 qt Bone stock
1/2 pt Oil
Make the bone stock just the way you would start a soup - buy good
stout beef bones from the butcher and boil them. Add all the other
ingregients and let stand overnight before using. Use this to rub
over meats or to baste them while they are cooking.  Put it on with a
little dish mop of the kind you see in the dime store. As you use it,
the flavor will change and improve, for you are constantly
transfering smoke and grease from the meat back to the mop
concoction.  If you have any left over, keep it in the refrigerator.
