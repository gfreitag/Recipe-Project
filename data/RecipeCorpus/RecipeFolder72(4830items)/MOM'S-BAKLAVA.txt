Title: MOM'S BAKLAVA
Categories: Desserts, Mom, Cathe
Yield: 1 Batch
3 c  Almonds, ground
-(1 lb)
4 c  Walnuts or pecans,
-ground (1 lb)
3/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Water
1    Cinnamon stick
1 1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Lemon peel, grated
2 ts Cinnamon, ground
1 1/2 c  Butter, melted
1 lb Filo, thawed
Spread nuts in a shallow baking pan and toast at 300 degrees F. for 10
minutes or until lightly browned. Cool.

Combine 3/4 C sugar, water and cinnamon stick in a saucepan. Boil
until clear.  Add honey and heat until well-blended. Cool and remove
cinnamon stick.

Combine 1/2 C sugar, lemon peel, and ground cinnamon in a large mixing
bowl.  Mash together with back of a spoon to blend citrus oil with
sugar. Add cooled toasted nuts and mix well.

Butter a 9x13 inch pan.  Line it with 3 sheets of filo, each of which
has been brushed with melted butter. Let filo overlap sides of pan.
Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of nut mixture. Repeat, alternating 2 sheets of
buttered filo and nut mixture, ending with filo. (After the second
set of sheets overlap the edges of the pan, start folding the sheets
in half after they are buttered.  They will fit almost perfectly in
the pan.)

After you put in the final sheet of filo, fold the filo that has been
hanging off the pan back onto the top sheet of filo so you have a
neat, sealed package. Using a razor blade or very sharp knife, cut
through the top layer of filo, making lengthwise strips 1 1/2 inches
wide. Cut diagonally, making diamonds.

Bake at 325 degrees F. for 1 hour or until golden brown. Remove from
oven, place pan on rack, and quickly cut pieces through completely.
Immediately pour cooled honey syrup over the baklava. Stop when you
run out of syrup or when the baklava stops sizzling when the syrup
hits it. This will help keep it crispy and keep it from becoming
soggy. Cool and serve. Makes about 4 dozen pieces.
