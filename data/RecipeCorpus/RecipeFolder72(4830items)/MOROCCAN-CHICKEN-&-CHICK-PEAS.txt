Title: MOROCCAN CHICKEN & CHICK PEAS
Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
1 cn Chick peas/garbanzos
3 lb Chicken pieces
1 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Cumin ground
Salt
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
2 tb Oil
1 lg Onion, finely chopped
Juice of 1 lemon
Dry chicken pieces with paper towels.  Combine turmeric and cumin
with 1 t salt and the cayenne pepper and rub into the chicken. Let
stand for 15 minutes. (I use less chicken when I make this dish,
sometimes I also substitute boneless breast or tenders) Heat oil in a
frying pan and brown chicken pieces on all sides. Remove to a plate
and add onion to pan. Fry gently until soft, add garlic and cook a
few seconds. Pour onion mixture into chick peas and add chicken
pieces and 1 Tablespoon of the lemon juice. Cover and simmer gently
until chicken and chick peas are tender and liquid is considerably
reduced. About 1/2 hour. Taste and add salt if necessary, and more
lemon juice to give a pleasant tang. Remove chicken pieces carefully,
place chick peas and liquid in a deep dish, put the chicken on top
and garnish with lemon wedges.
