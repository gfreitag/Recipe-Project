*NOTE: Original recipe used 3 T olive oil...I didn't want all that
fat but did want some of the taste so I changed it. **NOTE: Original
recipe used 1/4 C stock...you might need to add more if you use less
olive oil. ***NOTE: We used Portobello, crimini, shiitake, oyster and
chanterelle. They were truely wonderful!!

This Middle Eastern dish produces quite a bit of liquid that you drain
before serving; save these juices to make a flavorful soup stock.

Heat oil and stokc in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms
and garlic; cover and simmer until soft and brown, 8 - 9 minutes. Add
tomato; cook 1 min more. Stir in lemon juice, mint, salt and pepper;
remove from heat.  Drain and serve at room temp.

Serves 6 (Recipe states it will serve 4 but it serves at least 6
using the mushrooms that we used.)
