-seeds, orange peel

1 oz Ouzo (optional)
1/2 c  Water

The Greeks wrap coins in foil and knead them into this bread. They
believe anyone who finds a coin will have good luck in the coming
year.

Dissolve yeast in warm water and set aside.  Put spices, orange
peel,bay leaf, and ouzo in a pot with the 1/2 cup water and bring to
a boil. Set aside to steep and cool. Heat milk and remove from heat.
Add the butter and allow the milk to cool slightly.  Put the flour,
sugar, and salt in a large bowl.  Mix in eggs, yeast, milk mixture,
and flavored water (remove only the bay leaf) Stir the mixture until
all the flour has been absorbed.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until
smooth, about 20 minutes.  Place in a buttered bowl, and flip the
dough so the top is greased as well. Cover with a towel dampened with
hot water. Set in a warm, draft free place to rise until doubled in
bulk, about 4-6 hours.

Punch down the dough and knead for about 5 minutes. Shape into one
large round loaf and decorate the top with walnut halves. Set aside
to rise once more, about 2 hours (uncovered). Bake in a preheated 350
F oven for 1 hour.

Makes 1 loaf.
