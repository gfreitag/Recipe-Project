Title: MOZZZARELLA CHEESE PUFFS
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Flour; sifted
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Paprika
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
6 oz Mozzarella cheese; shredded
Recipe by: LouiseGray@aol.com Sift the dry ingredients together.
Cream the butter and the cheese. Add th dry ingredients and mix well.
Shape the mixture into small balls about 1" i diameter. Place them on
a lightly greased baking sheet and bake them for about 15 to 20
minutes at 350 degrees.

Note:  I just throw all the ingredients in my Kitchen-Aide mixer and
when t ingredients form a clump of dough, then I form the balls. I
also substitut different cheeses.  I might use cheddar with chopped
walnuts or provolone, sun-dried tomatos, and basil.. Just use your
imagination.
