Title: NEW WAVE EGGNOG
Categories: Beverages, Holidays
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
4 c  Half-and-half
1 1/2 c  Sugar
12 ea Large egg yolks
2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Dark rum
1/2 c  Brandy or cognac
1/2 c  Bourbon or scotch
1 pt High-quality vanilla ice cre
In a medium saucepan, combine the half-and-half and sugar. Cook over
low heat, stirring often, until the mixture comes to a low simmer. In
a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks till combined. Gradually whisk the
hot mixture into the yolks. Return the yolk mixture to the saucepan.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until
the custard lightly coats the spoon. (An instant-read thermometer
inserted in the custard will read 180 degrees F.) Immediately strain
the custard through a sieve into large bowl. Cool to room
temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until very
cold, at least 4 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, whip the
cream until soft peaks form. Stir the whipped cream, rum, brandy, and
bourbon into the chilled custard. (The eggnog can be prepared up to 1
day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.) Pour the eggnog into a punch
bowl. Place the vanilla ice cream in the punch bowl and serve. Makes
about 1-3/4 quarts. Source: "An Edible Christmas" (A Treasury of
