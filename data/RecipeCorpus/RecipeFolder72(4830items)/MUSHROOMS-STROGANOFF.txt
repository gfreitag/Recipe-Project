Title: MUSHROOMS STROGANOFF
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Onion; finely chopped
1    Garlic clove; crushed
25 g  Butter
-OR sunflower margarine
225 g  Small button mushrooms
-- finely sliced
1 ts Moutarde de Meaux (1-2 tsp)
100 g  Thick set yogurt

Based on a classic Stroganoff recipe, this version loses the wine
(and of course the beef!), and makes a delightful dish with
mushrooms, garlic, grainy mustard and thick yogurt. Serve it warm, on
a bed of rice, with a side salad.

Soften the onions and garlic in the butter or sunflower margarine
until translucent - about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and stir
until they are beginning to cook through but are not too soft. Strain
off most of the juices, reserving 2 tbs. Stir in the mustard and salt
to taste and mix thoroughly. Mix the reserved cooking juices into the
yogurt, and stir into the mushrooms. Heat through and serve warm.
