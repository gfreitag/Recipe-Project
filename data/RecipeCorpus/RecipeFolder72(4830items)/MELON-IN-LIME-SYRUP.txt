Categories: Desserts, Vegan
Yield: 3 Servings
1    Ogen or Charentais melon
150 ml Water
75 g  Sugar
2    Limes; juiced, rind grated
Serves 3-4

Chilled melon in a lime syrup makes an elegant sweet course, served
with crÂŠme fraiche or thick set yogurt. Light, fresh, summery food.

Cut the melon in half and discard the seeds. Cut out the flesh with a
melon baller. Put the water and sugar into a pan and bring to the
boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil hard to a thick syrup,
and then dilute with the lime juice. Add the rind, then pour over the
melon balls and leave for 1 hour at room temperature. Chill
thoroughly before serving.
