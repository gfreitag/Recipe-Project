Cut the lamb into 1-inch pieces. Heat the olive oil in a large
casserole over medium heat. Add the lamb and chopped onion and saute
5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the cinnamon, ginger, cumin,
saffron, chilies, garlic, cilantrol, salt, pepper, orange peel,
honey, juice of 1 lemon, and enough chicken broth or water to just
cover ingredients. Cover the casserole and simmer very slowly 2
hours, stirring occasionally.

Add the yellow onions, stir well, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, or
until onions are just tender.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

With a slotted spoon, transfer ingredients to a large bowl. Raise
heat to high and reduce liquid by half. Add juice of the remaining
lemons, stirring well. Return ingredients to casserole, stir until
blended, taste for seasonings, and place in the preheated oven,
uncovered. When the top of the cammama is slightly glazed, serve
immediately, garnished with a few sprigs of cilantro, and accompanied
by rice, Date and Onion Sambal, a salad of diced cucumbers and ripe
tomatoes dressed with oil, vinegar, and salt, and a basket of warm
pita bread.

AFTERTHOUGHT: You may substitute boned chicken thighs for the lamb if
you wish.
