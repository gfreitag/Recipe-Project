Title: MONGOLIAN HOT POT
Categories: Oriental, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Boneless lean lamb
4 oz Bean thread noodles
1/2 lb Spinach
1/2 lb Chinese cabbage
1 qt Chicken stock
1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
2 tb Finely chopped scallions
1 ts Minced garlic
1 tb Finely chopped cilantro
MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
2 tb Sesame paste
-=OR=- peanut butter
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
2 ts Chili bean sauce
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Hot water
USING A CLEAVER or sharp knife, slice the lamb into very thin slices.
Soak the noodles in warm water for 5 minutes, then drain them and cut
them into 5-inch lengths. Separate the spinach leaves from the stalks
and wash them well. Discard the stalks. Cut the Chinese cabbage into
3-inch pieces. Combine all the ingredients for the dipping sauce in a
small bowl and mix them well. Each guest should have his or her own
small portion of dipping sauce and a plate containing lamb, spinach
and Chinese cabbage. When you are ready to begin, bring the stock to
a boil and light the fondue. Ladle the stock into the fondue pot and
put the ginger, scallions, garlic and coriander into the stock. Each
person selects a piece of food and cooks it quickly in the pot. When
all the meat and vegetables have been eaten, add the noodles to the
pot, let them heat through, then ladle the soup into soup bowls. This
dish also works successfully with other foods such as steak, fish
balls, oysters, shrimp, squid, mushrooms and lettuce, although it
will no longer be a Mongolian Hot Pot, but more like the Cantonese
Chrysanthemum Pot.
