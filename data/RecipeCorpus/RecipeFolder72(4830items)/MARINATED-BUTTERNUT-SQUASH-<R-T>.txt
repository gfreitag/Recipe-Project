Title: MARINATED BUTTERNUT SQUASH <R T>
Categories: Fatfree, Side dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 md Butternut squash
1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
2 tb Water
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper; freshly ground
2 tb Mint; chopped
Recipe by: Donna Nicoletti in Eat More, Weigh Less pg. 258 Peel skin
from the squash and cut it in half. Carefully remove the seeds and
stringy matter.  Cut the squash into medium dice from the center.

In a saute pan, put the balsamic vinegar and water, salt and pepper,
and heat.  Add the squash and cook for just a few minutes; it should
remain firm.  Remove the squash and liquid from the heat and put into
a separate bowl.  Cool completely.  Add the chopped mint and serve as
a garnish or side dish.

This is quite good.  I didn't peel away the skin - just diced it and
then removed the skin - was much easier to do this way for me. Reggie
