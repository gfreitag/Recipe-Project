Title: MURKHA DAL
Categories: Indian
1/4 c  Butter
Yield: 2 Servings
2 ts Black Mustard Seeds
1    Onion -- Finely Chopped
2    Cloves Garlic -- Finely
Chopped
:
1 TB Ginger Root -- Grated
1 ts Turmeric
2    Green Chiles -- Finely
Chopped
:
1 c  Red Lentils
4 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Coconut Milk
1 ts Salt

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a moderate heat. Add the
mustard seeds and cover the pan. When you can hear the seeds popping,
add the onion, garlic, and ginger root. Cook, uncovered, until they
are soft and the garlic is brown, about 7 - 8 minutes.

Stir in the turmeric and green chilies and cook for 1 ~ 2 minutes
until the chilies soften a little.

Add the lentils and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the
lentils begin to turn translucent.

Add the water, coconut milk, and salt. Stir well. Bring to a boil,
then reduce the heat, and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the desired
consistency is reached. You may like it more liquid than I do, in
which case 40 minutes will be about right, but cook it longer if you
prefer a thicker consistency. (However, if you intend to reheat the
dal later rather then eat it straightaway, cook for only 30 minutes
to allow for reheating time.)

Serve immediately while piping hot.
