Title: MOONG DAL
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 c  Moong dal, roasted
1/2 c  Water
1 1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Turmeric
3 tb Ghee
1 pn Cumin seeds
2 sm Bay leaves
2 ea Red chiles
2 md Yellow onions, thinly sliced
1 1/4 ts Ginger, grated
2 1/2 tb Raisins
1/4 c  Coconut, fresh, chopped
1/4 ts Cardamom, ground
1/4 ts Garam masala
1/4 ts Sugar
4 tb Cilantro, chopped
Wash dal & bring to a boil.  Add salt & turmeric, remove any scum that
gathers on the surface.  Cover & simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until
tender.  (Mark's note: the recipe doesn't say, but I presume that it
is calling for split moong beans: whole ones take a whole lot longer
to cook than this).

Heat ghee in a large pot & add cumin seeds, bay leaves, chiles,
onions & ginger.  Fry for 2 minutes, stirring. Add raisins & coconut
& mix in the cooked dal. Add the remaining ingredients & simmer over
low heat, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  If the resultant dal is
too thick, thin it with a little water. It should be conssitency of
pea soup.
