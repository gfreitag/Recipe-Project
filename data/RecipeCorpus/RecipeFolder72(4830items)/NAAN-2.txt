Title: NAAN 2
Categories: Indian, Breads
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
1/2 c  Flour, whole wheat
4    Egg
1 c  Cream, heavy
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
Ghi
Mix flours, eggs, cream, salt, baking powder, and soda to make a soft
dough (like pizza), and knead 10-15 minutes. Add 2 ounces of oil or
melted butter and knead again for 5-8 minutes. Form into a ball,
cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until double in
size. When the dough is ready, a finger pressed in the dough will
make an impression. This will take from 1-2 hours, depending on
temperature and humidity.

Divide the dough into 8-10 balls.  Dipping your fingers into the bowl
of oil or butter, lightly pat each ball to coat with fat. Cover again
with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the
oven to 450 degrees.

Wet your palms with oil or butter and pat each ball into a flat
circle, making the circle thinner in the center and a tiny bit
thicker at the edge. Pull one side to make the circle into a teardrop
shape. Each nan should be about the size of your hand.

Place the naan on a cookie sheet and brush the tops with oil or
butter. Bake 10-12 minutes until the nan become puffy. To make them a
perfect golden color, place the baked nan under a broiler for a
minute or two. Serve at once.
