Title: MILOPITA ( GREEK APPLE PASTRY )
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Commercial filo sheets
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
8    Apples*
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Allspice
1 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Currants or raisins
1/2 c  Walnuts
1/2 c  Butter; melted
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 c  Powdered sugar
*Note- Apples should be cored, peeled and chopped.  If desired, 2 cups
canned apples (drained) may be substituted. Defrost frozen filo to
room temperature, 2 to 4 hours. Mix filling in a bowl tossing
ingredients with a spoon.  Set aside.
Lay 5 sheets filo flat, one on top of each other, with a little
melted butter brushed between the sheets. Spread 1 cup of filling
along one end. Roll filo over the apple filling so you will have a
long filled tube. Fold side edges over 1/2" so filling won't fall
out. Continue rolling.
Place in a buttered baking pan or cookie sheet. Brush tops
generously with melted butter.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Sift
powdered sugar over tops and sides as soon as it is taken out of the
oven and while still hot.  When cool, cut into 2" pieces and serve.
