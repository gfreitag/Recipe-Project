Title: NO PAIN SALSA
Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Salsa
Yield: 6 Servings
14 1/2 oz Red Gold tomatoes
L large onion
3    Or 4 bannana peppers (not
-hot!)
1 lg Handful fresh cilantro OR
2 tb Dry cilantro
1/2    Clove of garlic
1 tb Lemon juice
Put into blender and blast until its chopped up real good. This makes
about a pound of salsa.  In fact it fits into an empty Sams Choice
Salsa jar just fine. She also sometimes puts green peppers into the
recipe which doesn't make it hot either. This recipe satisfies my
need for salsa, however, I like it hot sometimes myself.
