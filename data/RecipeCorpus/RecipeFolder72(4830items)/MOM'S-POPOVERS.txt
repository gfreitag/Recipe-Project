Title: MOM'S POPOVERS
Categories: Quick bread, Mom
Yield: 1 Batch
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
2 lg Eggs
1 tb Butter, melted
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Grease 2 heavy (cast iron) muffin
pans and put in oven to get hot.

Sift together flour and salt.  Beat eggs with rotary beater; add milk
and butter.  Sift in flour, beating only enough to make a smooth
batter. Fill hot, greased muffin pans 1/3 full. Bake at 450 degrees
for 30 minutes, then lower temperature to 350 degrees and bake about
15 to 30 minutes, or until firm, brown and "popped." KEEP OVEN DOOR
CLOSED WHILE BAKING!

VARIATIONS:

*  Daddy substitutes meat juice from roasts for the milk (like
Yorkshire Pudding).  Don't add salt; if there is any fat in the
juice, that should go toward the tablespoon of butter.

*  For a cheese version, add 1 more egg and 2 T more butter. When
water sizzles on hot pan, pour 1 T batter into each cup and sprinkle
each with 1 teaspoon shredded cheddar; fill cups with rest of batter
till 3/4 full. (Uses a total of 1/4 C cheese.)

*  For a variation with pecans, add 1/3 C, chopped. Cook at 475
degrees for 15 minutes, then at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.

*  For eggnog popovers, add 1 T dry, instant eggnog, 1 T rum and 1/4 t
nutmeg.  (For only 6 popovers.) Follow cooking instructions for
Caraway Rye Popovers...

*  Caraway Rye:  Decrease flour, substitute w/ 1/4 C rye flour. Add
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.  (For only 6 popovers.) Cook at 400
degrees just till crusts are very firm; prick with fork to let steam
escape and return to oven (turned off) 5-10 minutes to crisp.
