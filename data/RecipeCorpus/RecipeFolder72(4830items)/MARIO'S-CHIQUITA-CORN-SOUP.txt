discard. Cut away top. Slice the pepper lengthwise and scrape away
seeds. Chop remaining pepper and set aside.

Cut tortillas into bite-size pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a
skillet over medium-high heat. Add tortilla pieces and cook until
brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Set aside.

Place 3 cups corn kernels in blender and process until smooth. Heat 2
tablespoons olive oil in large heavy pan over medium-low heat. Add
remaining 1 cup corn and cook 1 minute, stirring often. Add pureed
corn and continue, to cook 5 minutes, stirring constantly.

Add whipping cream, milk and salt to corn mixture, stirring gently;
heat 10 to 15 minutes (do not boil).

Garnish each serving with equal amounts of crispy tortilla pieces,
Monterey Jack cheese, diced poblano pepper and black pepper. Serve
immediately. Makes 6 servings.
