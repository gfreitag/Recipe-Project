Title: MR. FOOD'S SKILLET CORNED BEEF & CABBAGE
Categories: Meats, Corned
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
8 c  Shredded green cabbage
- (1/2 a large head)
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
30 oz Whole potatoes, drained
14 1/2 oz Sliced carrots, drained
3/4 lb Deli-style corned beef,

======================================================= ====== In a
large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the cabbage and
saute for 6 to 8 minutes, until very soft but not brown. Add the salt
and pepper; mix well. Add the potatoes, carrots, and corned beef; mix
to distribute evenly. Reduce the heat to med NOTE: I like to rinse my
canned potatoes and drain them well before using. And, sure, you can
shred the cabbage yourself, but if you're low on time, make it easier
on yourself and buy it already shredded in a package.
