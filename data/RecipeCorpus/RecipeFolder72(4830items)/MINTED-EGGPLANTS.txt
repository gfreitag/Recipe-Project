Title: MINTED EGGPLANTS
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lg Eggplants
1 tb Salt
1 tb Olive oil
1    Juice of lemon
4 tb Freshly chopped mint
1 ts Ground cumin
1    Garlic clove, crushed
Black pepper
5 oz Yogurt
4 tb Freshly chopped mint
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Cut eggplants into 1 cm thick slices & layer them in a colander with
the salt.  Let them drain for 30 minutes. Wash them under cold water
& dry them on paper towels. Beat together oil, lemon juice, mint,
cumin, garlic & pepper.  Beat together, separately, the yogurt, mint
& cumin.

Heat the grill to high.  Lay the eggplant slices on the hot rack &
brush them with half the lemon mixture. Grill them until they begin
to brown. This will take about 2 minutes. Turn over, brush with the
rest of the lemon mixture & brown.

Serve grilled eggplants hot with the sauce separately as an
appetizer. Or place the eggplant on a large platter & spoon the sauce
over the top & serve as a vegetable accompaniment for middle eastern
dishes.
