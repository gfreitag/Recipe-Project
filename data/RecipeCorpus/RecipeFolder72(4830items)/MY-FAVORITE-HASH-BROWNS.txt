1.  In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the potatoes and cover
with water; cook for 20 to 30 minutes, until just tender. Remove from
the heat, drain, and cool.  Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick
rounds, then into quarters. 2. In a large skillet over medium heat,
heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and garlic, cover, and sweat
until translucent. 3. Add 1 tablespoon of butter, let it melt, then
add the potatoes. Continue to fry and turn the potatoes as needed to
keep them from burning, scraping the crisp bits from the bottom of
the skillet. Add additional oil and butter only if absolutely
necessary.  When the potatoes begin to turn golden brown, stir in the
sage and parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue
to saute and scrape the potatoes from the bottom of the pan until
they are deep golden brown.

Serves 8.
