Categories: Dak, Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
-SHARON WERTZ(SBVD40A)
2 1/2 ts Yeast
1 c  Oatmeal
2 c  Bread flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 tb Gluten
2 tb Honey
1 ts Salt
1 tb Oil or applesauce
1 1/4 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
1 ts Cinnamon
You can add the raisins and nuts at the beginning of the cycle or at
the "beeps"  You may need to add more water. Here in AZ I have to add
a couple more tablespoons of water when the weather is very dry. If
the machine seems to strain to knead the dough, add a little more
water. Use the sweet bread cycle, as the sugar and raisins make the
crust brown quickly. I put a piece of foil on top to brown the top
crust a bit more.
