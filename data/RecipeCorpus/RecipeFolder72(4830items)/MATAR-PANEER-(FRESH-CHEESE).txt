Paneer is a fresh cheese with plenty of texture and protein. In this
traditional northern Indian dish, Paneer is combined with gree peas
in a spicy tomato-ginger sauce. Fresh Paneer is quite crumbly, so it
is generally cut into cubes and sauteed until golden before combining
with other ingredients. For variety, try adding some finely minced
fresh cilantro and a little freshly ground black pepper to the
mixture before cubing and frying.  If you do have any left over,
serve it warm in whole wheat pita bread topped with sliced tomaotes
and crunchy red onions.

PANEER:

FOR PANEER: Bring milk to a boil. As soon as it begins to bubble,
stir in lemon juice; remove from heat. Allow to rest 15 minutes; the
curds will separate from the whey. Strain curds through a triple
layer of cheesecloth; squeeze out as much whey as you easily can.
Discard whey. Knead flour into curds, place on a plate; pat to 3/4
inch thickness. Refrigerate while preparing sauce. For sauce, place
all ingredients except peas in a blender or food processor; blend to
a smooth paste. Pour into a large skillet, bring to a boil; simmer,
uncovered, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, remove Paneer from
refrigerator, cut into 1 inch cubes. Heat the 2 tbsp oil in a
on-stick skillet, saute cubes until golden on both sides. Add paneer
cubes and peas to sauce. Simmer for ten minutes or until peas are
cookes. Serve with steamed rice. Makes 4-5 servings.
