Title: MENEMEN (TURKISH SCRAMBLED EGGS)
Categories: Turkish, Eggs, Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Onion
4    Tomatoes
4    Green hot peppers
5 tb Butter
8    Eggs
Salt
Pepper
1 ts Mild paprika powder
Chop the onion finely. Cut a cross in the top of the tomatoes and put
them in hot water. Remove the skins. Cut the tomatoes into small
pieces. Wash the peppers and cut them into very small rings. Heat the
butter in a big skillet. Sautee the onion until soft, then add
peppers and tomatoes and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes. Beat the
eggs with salt and pepper and paprika powder. Pour mixture over
vegetables. Keep stirring with a fork until set. (Serve on nice fresh
homemade or -of course- Turkish bread)

Be careful with the peppers. Peppers used here are the Turkish kind, a
cross between parika's and hot peppers. Remove the seeds to make them
less hot.
