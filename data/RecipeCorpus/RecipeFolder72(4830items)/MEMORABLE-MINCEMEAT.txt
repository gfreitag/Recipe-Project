From Blue Ribbon Cook Book, Winnipeg Manitoba 1905 - Mince Pie Hints
Dried apples soaked in water a few hours make a very fair substitute
for fresh apples in mince pies. Dried cherries and other fruit
prepared with sugar can be soaked 10-12 hours in a very little water
and then both water and fruit used instead of raisins. They will be
much cheaper and will answer very well.  Economical housewives will
often find hints like these very serviceable.
