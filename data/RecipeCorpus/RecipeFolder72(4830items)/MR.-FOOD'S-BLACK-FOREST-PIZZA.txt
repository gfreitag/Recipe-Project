8 oz Pkg cream cheese, softened
2 tb Confectioners' sugar
8 oz Frozen whipped topping,

=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the
prepared batter evenly over the bottom of a 12 inch pizza pan that
has been coated with nonstick baking spray. Bake for 20 to 25
minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out
clean; let cool. In a large bowl, with an electric beater on medium
speed, beat the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and whipped
topping until smooth. With a wet table knife, spread the mixture
evenly over the brownie pizza, then spoon the cherry pie filling
evenly over that. Cut and serve immediately, or cover and chill until
ready to serve. NOTE: Before serving, how about topping this pizza
with an extra dollop of whipped cream?
