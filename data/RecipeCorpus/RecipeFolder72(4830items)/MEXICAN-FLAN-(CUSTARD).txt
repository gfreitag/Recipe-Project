Title: MEXICAN FLAN (CUSTARD)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
8    Eggs
2/3 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
26 oz Evaporated milk, undiluted
2 ts Vanilla
Traditionally this is made with a layer of caramelized sugar on the
bottom of the pan: heat white sugar in a heavy pan until it melts and
turns light brown, then quickly and carefully pour it into the baking
pan and tilt the pan so it runs all over the bottom.

Beat eggs, mix in sugar and salt, then milk and vanilla. Pour into a
glass baking dish and set the dish in a pan of hot water in the oven
at 350 degrees. Bake uncovered for 1 hour or until solid. I think it
comes out better if you don't stir it while it's cooking.
