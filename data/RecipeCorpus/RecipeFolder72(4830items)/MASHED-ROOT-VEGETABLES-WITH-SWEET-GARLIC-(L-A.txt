A simple blending of celery root, potatoes and parsnip makes these
mashed root vegetables as smooth as silk without much fat. The russet
potatoes have just the right starchy texture to thicken the mixture.
Celery root browns quickly once its surface is exposed to the air, so
have the salted water boiling, ready for the peeled celery root and
potatoes.

Plunge celery roots, potatoes and parsnip into pot of boiling
water. Cook 10 minutes. Add garlic cloves. Cook until vegetables are
tender, about 10 min. more. Drain vegetables.
Put hot drained vegetables, butter, salt, nutmeg and pepper into
processor fitted with metal blade. Puree mixture until very smooth,
stopping to scrape down sides of bowl, about 1 to 2 minutes. Adjust
seasonings to taste. Transfer to greased 5-cup capacity baking dish.
Cover dish with foil. Can be made several hours ahead and kept at room
temperature.
To serve, bake at 300 deg. until hot or reheat in microwave oven.
Spoon hot mixture onto 6 heated dinner plates, dividing evenly. Ladle
hot venison ragout over, again dividing evenly. Serve immediately.
