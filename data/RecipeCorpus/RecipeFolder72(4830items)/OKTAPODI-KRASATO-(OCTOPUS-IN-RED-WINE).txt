Title: OKTAPODI KRASATO (OCTOPUS IN RED WINE)
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/4 lb Young octopus
8 tb Olive oil
12 oz Shallots
1/2 c  Red wine
6 tb Red wine vinegar
8 oz Canned tomatoes;
-roughly chopped
2 tb Tomato puree
4    Bay leaves
2 ts Dried oregano
Black pepper
2 tb Parsley; chopped
First clean the octopus.  Pull off the tentacles, remove and discard
the intestines and the ink sac, the eyes and the beak. Skin the
octopus and wash and scrub it thoroughly to remove any traces of
sand. Cut it into 1 1/2 to 2 inch pieces and put it into a saucepan
over medium heat to release the liquid.  Stir the octopus until this
liquid has evaporated.

Pour on the oil and stir the octopus to seal it on all sides. Add the
whole onions and cook them, stirring once or twice, until they colour
slightly.

Add the wine, the vinegar, tomatoes, tomato puree, bay leaves,
oregano and several grindings of pepper.  Stir well, cover the pan
and simmer very gently for 60 to 75 minutes, checking from time to
time that the sauce has not dried out.  If it does - and this would
only happen if the heat were too high - add a little more wine or
water. The octopus is cooked when it can be easily pierced with a
skewer.

The sauce should be thick, like a runny paste.  If any of the liquid
separates, remove the lid from the pan, slightly increase the heat
and stir until some of the liquid evaporates and the sauce thickens.
Discard the bay leaves and stir in the parsley.  Taste the sauce and
adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Serve, if you like, with rice and a salad.  A Greek essential is
country bread to mop up the sauce.
