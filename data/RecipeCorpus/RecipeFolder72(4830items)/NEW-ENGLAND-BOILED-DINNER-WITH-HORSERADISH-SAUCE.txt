Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Corned beef brisket, cured
4 qt Water
1 ts Pickling spice
1    Garlic clove, halved
2 c  Trimmed brussels sprouts
-(about 12 ounces)
12 sm Boiling onions

1 tb All-purpose flour
1 tb Sugar

2 ts Margarine
1. Trim fat from brisket. Place brisket in a large stockpot, and add
water, pickling spice, and garlic. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce
heat, and simmer 1 hour. Add Brussels sprouts and next 4 ingredients
(Brussels sprouts through rutabaga) to pot, and bring to a boil.
Cover and simmer 1 hour or until brisket is tender. Remove brisket
and vegetables from pot; reserve 1 cup cooking liquid. Let brisket
stand 5 minutes, and cut into thin slices. Set vegetables aside, and
keep warm.

2. Combine flour, sugar, and mustard in a small saucepan; stir in
vinegar until smooth. Gradually add 1 cup reserved cooking liquid,
stirring with a whisk until blended. Bring to a boil over medium-high
heat. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Remove from heat;
add horseradish and margarine, and stir until blended. Serve
horseradish sauce with brisket and vegetables.

Note: Even though this recipe has 40% calories from fat, a single
serving has only 18.5 grams of fat. Add some New England brown bread
and the calories from fat should amount to less than 30%.

This updated boiled dinner becomes a complete meal with a molded
cranberry-orange salad, brown bread, and apple juice.

Yield: 6 servings (SERVING SIZE: 3 ounces brisket, 2 onions, 1
carrot, 2 parsnip pieces, 2 rutabaga pieces, 1/3 cup Brussels
sprouts, and 2 tablespoons horseradish sauce).
