Place  the  popped corn in a large greased bowl or pan. In a heavy 2
qt saucepan, stir together corn syrup, sugar, water and vinegar.
Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until mixture boils.
Continue cooking, stirring occasionally,  until temperature reaches
260 degrees on a candy thermometer or until a small amount of mixture
dropped in very cold water forms  a ball hard enough to hold its
shape, yet plastic. Remove from heat; stir in margarine.  Slowly pour
over popcorn, stirring to coat well.

When cool enough to handle, yet still quite warm, quicly shape into
balls with  well-buttered  or oiled hands. Wrap individually in
plastic wrap. Makes about 10 3 inch balls.

** Option ** Substitute 2 Tblsp of praline liqueur for
2    tblsp of the water.
