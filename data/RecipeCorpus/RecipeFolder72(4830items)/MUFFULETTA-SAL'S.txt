Great sandwich!!!! What makes a muffuletta sandwich i the "dressin" or
topping, the sandwich is made on a round loaf of French/Italian
bread, the loaf is split and it consists of the above meats and
cheeses and topped with the toppings ingredients which have been
chopped coarse by hand or in a processor.

When making the basic sandwich place mix on meats and top with
cheese...place under broiler to melt cheese and heat meats and toast
top of sandwich.  If you are ever in NOR'LEANS THE WORLD FAMOUS
CENTRAL GROCERY IN THE FRENCH QUARTER SERVES THE BEST.  ENJOY...SAL
