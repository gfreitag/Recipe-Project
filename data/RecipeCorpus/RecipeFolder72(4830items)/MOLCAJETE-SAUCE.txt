A molcajete is a Mexican mortar and pestle made of stone. This is one
of the simplest hot sauce recipes and one that has endless
variations. It's the perfect way to use up peppers from your garden.

Roast the tomato in a skillet or comal until the skin is a little
charred. Combine all ingredients in a molcajete and mash or put them
in a blender and blend quickly, do not puree. Salt to taste. Serve
with chips, eggs or eat it straight out of the bowl.
