UNFORMATED RECIPE
I just made these and they are SO SWEET that I think my lips are now
permanently puckered! 1 quart whole milk, heated to a temp of 110F.
(I did this in a large fry-pan. Stir in 2 well-beaten egg yolks. (Do
this quickly) Dissolve 3 rennett tablets in 1 TBSP cold water - this
is a little difficult. I had to really smash them up. When dissolved,
add it to the milk mixture. Cover (I used a small towel) and leave it
in a warm spot for about 1 hour. When the mixture looks set, take a
knife and cut down the middle vertically and horizontally, and then
cut through the center of each triangle again. Put the mixture back
on the stove on the lowest setting. (I had to put the grid from the
other side of my cooktop on top of the other grid to get the
temperature low enough. If it looks like it's boiling, the temp is
too high). When the pieces start to move apart from each other (about
15 minutes later) you will need to add 1 pound piloncillo or light
brown sugar around the spaces in between each piece. This takes a
little time and patience. Let it cook for 2 more hours on this low
setting. When done, let it cool at room temperature. Then, roll the
pieces up, starting at the tip, and secure with a toothpick. Put the
pieces in another dish, and pour the syrup from the pot over the
chongos. They should be eaten at room temperature and can be stored
for a few days in the refrigerator, but cannot be frozen. This is the
perfect dish for someone craving "something sweet"! P.S. Almost
forgot - stick a few pieces of cinnamon around with the brown sugar.
