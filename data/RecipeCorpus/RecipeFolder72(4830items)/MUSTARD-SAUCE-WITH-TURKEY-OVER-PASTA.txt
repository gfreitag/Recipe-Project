Title: MUSTARD SAUCE WITH TURKEY OVER PASTA
Categories: Poultry, Quick and e
Yield: 1 Servings
4 tb Butter
1/4 c  Flour
3 c  Chicken broth
2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Dijon mustard, heaping
3 c  Cooked turkey, cubed
1 lb Pasta
Melt butter in large pan. Stir in flour to make a roux. Slowly mix in
hot chicken broth. I used broth made from the turkey carcass. Boil to
thicken. Add cream, mustard and stir until mixed. Add turkey and heat
until warm. Serve over hot pasta. I used red pepper pasta

NOTES : Great to use up leftover turkey. Major hit with the men in the
house. Served them with steamed brusse lsprouts. Great combination.
You could use cooked chicken.
