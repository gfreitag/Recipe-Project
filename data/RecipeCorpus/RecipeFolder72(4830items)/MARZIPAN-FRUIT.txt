Title: MARZIPAN FRUIT
Categories: Candies, Holiday, Christmas, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Almond paste
2 1/4 c  Confectioner's sugar
1 ea Egg white; beaten lightly
* Blend the almond paste and sugar together. Add enough egg white to
create the consistency of modeling clay.

BANANA Color the marzipan light yellow and roll it into the banana
shape. Dissolve cocoa in a little water and, with a small paint
brush, streak the fruit with brown lines.

APPLE Color the marzipan light green or green yellow. Shape into apple
shape and make an impression on top with a chopstick. Finish the
apple with a brown stem and a green leaf (made of marzipan)

STRAWBERRY Color the marzipan red and shape it into a strawberry.
Roll the berry in granulated sugar. Make the hull with green marzipan.

ORANGE Make a smooth ball of orange-colored marzipan; then press a
piece of paper towel against the sides to create the texture of
orange skin. Push a whole clove into the stem end of the orange.

This recpie makes one full-sized fruit or eight miniatures. Using
chopsticks or toothpicks help the modeling process. Paste food
coloring is the best, though liquid works o.k.
