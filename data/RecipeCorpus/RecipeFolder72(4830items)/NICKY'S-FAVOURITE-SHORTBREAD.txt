Title: NICKY'S FAVOURITE SHORTBREAD
Categories: Christmas, Cookies
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Unsalted butter (room temp.)
1/2 c  Icing sugar
2 c  All purpose flour*
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
Slivers of glaced cherries
* 1 3/4 c if measured before sifting

Cream butter and sugar together until silky.  Add sifted dry
ingredients and mix until blended, but just. Turn out on a lightly
floured pastry cloth, & with lightly floured hands, gather into one
lump. (This may appear sloppy & maybe hopeless.  As in pastry, you
will go wrong if you are too heavy handed or afraid of it!) Toss it
just a bit to get it to lump and pat out into a square about 1/3 inch
thick; square off your edges with a large knife or spatula, smooth
with a stocking rolling pin and cut into 1 inch squares. Place
slightly apart on ungreased cookie sheet with a sliver of cherry on
each.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes. They should be just
pale brown on bottom. WATCH IT, THEY BURN VERY EASILY. Remove gently
please, they are still having birth pangs; place to cool on trays
covered with waxed paper. Store in cans, they keep for weeks in a
cool place, and their flavour mellows.
