Title: MAUREEN'S CARROT FRUIT CAKE
Categories: Gifts, Cake, Desserts, Fruits, Holidays
6 ea carrot -- grated
Yield: 8 Servings
2 2/3 c  sugar
1 lb raisins
2 2/3 c  water
2 TB butter
2 ts cinnamon
2 ts cloves, ground
2 ts allspice
2 ts salt
4 c  flour
4 ts baking soda
1 lb pecans -- (or walnuts)
1 lb candied fruit

Combine carrots, sugar, water, raisins, salt and spices in a large
pan and boil 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool. Stir in the
flour, soda then the candied fruit and nuts. Pour batter into well
greased and floured loaf pans or one large bundt pan. Bake in 325 to
350 degree oven for one hour.

If you wish to season this with spirits use about 1/2 cup of rum or
brandy and after the cake has cooled thorougly, pour the alcohol
gently over the cake. It may be best to do this just a little at a
time over the period of 30 min. or so. Wrap tightly in foil and store
in a cool place for as long a 3 months. After I give this cake as a
gift, I recommendthat, after opening, it be stored in the
refrigerator.
