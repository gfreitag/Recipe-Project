Title: NITER KEBBEH (SPICED BUTTER OIL)
Categories: Africa, Ethiopia, Salads
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Butter, unsalted; cut into
-small pieces
1    Onion, small; chopped coars
-ely
3 tb Garlic cloves; chopped fine
4 ts Ginger root; chopped fine
1 1/2 ts Turmeric
1    Cardamon pod
1    Cinnamon stick; 1"
1    Cloves, whole
1/8 ts Nutmeg, ground
1. In a heavy 5 quart saucepan, heat the butter over moderate heat,
turning it about with a spoon to melt it slowly and completely
without letting it brown. Then increase the heat and bring the butter
to a boil. When the surface is completely covered with white foam,
stir in the onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cardamon, cinnamon,
clove and nutmeg. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible point and
simmer uncovered and undisturbed for 45 minutes, or until the milk
solids on the bottom of the pan are a golden brown and the butter on
top is transparent.

2. Slowly pour the clear liquid niter kebbeh into a bowl, straining it
through a fine sieve lined with a linen towel or four layers of
dampened cheesecloth. Discard the seasonings. If there are any solids
left in the kebbeh, strain it again to prevent it from becoming
rancid later.

3. Pour the kebbeh into a jar, cover tightly, and store in the
refrigerator or at room temperature until ready to use. Kebbeh will
solidify when chilled. It can safely be kept, even at room
temperature, for 2 or
3    months.
