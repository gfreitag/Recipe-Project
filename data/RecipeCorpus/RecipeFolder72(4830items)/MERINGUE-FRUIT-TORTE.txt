Title: MERINGUE FRUIT TORTE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
MERINGUE
2    Egg whites at room temp.
1/2 ts White vinegar
pn Salt
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
LEMON SAUCE
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Cornstarch
1 ts Grated lemon peel
1/3 c  Water
1/3 c  Fresh lemon juice
1    Egg, beaten
2 c  Cut-up fresh fruit
Garnish:  Mint leaves
To make meringue:  In bowl, combine egg whites, vinegar, and salt.
Beat until soft peaks form.  Add sugar, 1 tbsp (15 ml) at a time;
beat until stiff peaks form.

Line a baking sheet with parchment or brown paper (aluminum foil may
also be used).  Draw a circle with an 8-inch diameter. Spoon
egg-white mixture on paper pattern; with a spoon shape mixture into a
circle with sides about 2 inches higher than centre.  Or prepare
individual meringues 2 inches in diameter.

Bake single meringue in 250F oven for about 1 1/2 hours or until
slightly coloured.  Turn off oven and leave meringue to cool for 2
hours or overnight before removing from oven. Carefully remove from
paper. (Bake individual meringue for 50 to 60 minutes).

To make lemon sauce:  In small saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch,
and lemon peel.  Stir in water and lemon juice; cook over medium
heat, stirring constantly until slightly thickened.  Carefully stir
one-quarter of hot mixture into beaten egg to prevent egg from
coagulating; return to hot mixture, stirring constantly. Cook and
stir for 4 minutes or until thickened.  Cover and refrigerate.

Just before serving, combine cut-up fruit with lemon sauce. Spoon into
meringue shell and serve, garnished with mint leaves.

My Note:  Lemon sauce can be made with two egg yolks if you are
unconcerned about cholesterol.  Check the meringue at about 40
minutes - tastes good without the extra drying time for eating the
same day.
