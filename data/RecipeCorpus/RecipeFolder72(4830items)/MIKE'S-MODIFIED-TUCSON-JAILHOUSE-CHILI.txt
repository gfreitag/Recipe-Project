Dice onions and garlic.  Saute beef and sausage.  When starting to
turn color, add the onion and garlic and saute till meat is brown.
Add the rest of the ingredients, simmer for a couple of hours. If the
beef is real cheap and tough, longer simmer for tender.  If you used
good stuff a couple of hours to let the flavors blend will do it.
