Title: MIDEASTERN ARROZ CON POLLO
Categories: Chicken, Rice, Salli's
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Pine nuts
3 tb Olive oil, divided
1    3 to 4 pound chicken, cut up
White pepper
Juice of 3 lemons
2 c  Long-grain rice
2    Onions, chopped
3    Garlic cloves, minced
1    8 oz. can tomato sauce
1/8 ts Cinnamon
Salt
3    Carrots, chopped
3    Celery stalks, chopped
1    Green bell pepper, diced
1    16 oz. bag frozen peas
Saute pine nuts in 1/2 TBSP. olive oil over medium-low heat until
lightly browned, about 1 minute. Set aside. Place chicken in
9x13-inch baking dish. Drizzle with 1 TBSP. olive oil and the lemon
juice. Sprinkle with pepper. Cover tightly with foil and bake in a
350-degree oven for 45 to 55 minutes, until juices run clear.
Meanwhile, saute the rice in 1/2 TBSP. olive oil over medium heat
until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Saute the onion
and garlic in 1 TBSP. olive oil over medium heat. Stir in tomato
sauce, cinnamon, salt to taste, carrots, celery and green pepper.
Simmer until the vegetables are just cooked, 6 to 8 minutes. Cover
and set aside. When the chicken is done, remove it from the pan and
set aside until it's cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, carefully pour
the pan juices into a large measuring cup and add enough water or
chicken stock to make 4 cups. Add the rice and cook, covered, over
medium-low heat until the rice is done, about 20 minutes. While the
rice is cooking, debone the chicken and cut into bite-size pieces,
discarding the skin and bones. Put the chicken chunks in the covered
pan with the cooked vegetables to keep warm. Cook the peas according
to package directions and add them to the chicken-vegetable mixture.
When the rice is done, combine it with the chicken-vegetable mixture
in the baking dish or another serving piece. Garnish with pine nuts
and serve.
