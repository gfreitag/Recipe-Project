Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk and about 1/2 cup of flour. In
a large bowl, blend butter, sugar, salt and eggs. Add yeast dough and
mix thoroughly. Gradually, add 2 1/2 cups flour to make a medium
dough. Place in a greased bowl and brush with melted butter. Cover
with a damp cloth and allow to rise until double in volume, about 3
hours. Use 1 cup or more flour to knead dough and roll into a 4 to 5
foot long rope. Form into a oval on a 14 x 17" greased cookie sheet,
connecting ends of the rope with a few drops of water. Press the doll
(or bean) into the dough from underneath. Cover with a damp cloth and
let rise until double in volume, about 1 hour. Bake @ 325 degrees for
35 to 45 minutes or until lightly browned. Brush top of cake with
corn syrup and sprinkle with alternating bands of colored sugar. Cake
freezes well.
