chicken in a 9" x 13" baking dish that has been coated with nonstick
vegetable spray. Sprinkle the chicken with the flour, coating evenly.
In a small bowl. combine the remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour
evenly over the chicken and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake
for 30 minutes , then uncover and bake for 30 to 35 more minutes, or
until the juices run clear and no pink remains. Note: Although
removing the skin from the chicken reduces the fat, this recipe works
just as well with the skin on.
