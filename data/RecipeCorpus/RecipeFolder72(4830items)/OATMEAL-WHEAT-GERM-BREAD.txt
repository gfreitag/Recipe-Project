Categories: Breads, Brdmachine

1 1/2 c  Water
1 ts Salt
2 tb Oil
3 tb Honey
2 tb Powdered milk
2/3 c  Oatmeal
1/4 c  Wheat germ

Combine all ingredients into bread machine pan.  Set for white bread.
I use the 2 hour bake setting.

This bread has a nice light brown color and a fine texture, one of our
favorites.
