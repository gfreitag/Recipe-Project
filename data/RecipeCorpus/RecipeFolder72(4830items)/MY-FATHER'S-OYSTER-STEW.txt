Title: MY FATHER'S OYSTER STEW
Categories: Stews, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pt Oysters
1/2 c  Oyster liquor
1 qt Milk
1 pt Half & half
1 c  Cream
2 tb Butter
Salt; to taste
Pepper; to taste
Heat milk, half and half, and cream to the boiling point but do not
boil. At the same general time, but obviously later because the
volume of liquid is smaller, heat the oyster liquor in a separate
pan. When the milk is hot, throw the butter in to melt. Add some salt
and lots of pepper (I like to use a coarse grind pepper). When the
liquor is hot, add the oysters. Continue to heat the liquor plus
oysters until the oysters just begin to curl at the edges, maybe two
minutes. Then dump the oysters and liquor into the milk.  "Correct
the seasonings" and serve it forth.

My wife likes to add paprika to hers at the table. I like oyster
crackers with mine, and in general like the little commercial ones
rather than the more elegant and expensive ones. You can fiddle with
this recipe all you want - more milk and less cream, or vice versa;
more pepper and salt (I like lots of both); fewer oysters - it really
comes down to your taste.
