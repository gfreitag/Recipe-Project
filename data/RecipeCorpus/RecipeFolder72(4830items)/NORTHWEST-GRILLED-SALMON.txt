Title: NORTHWEST GRILLED SALMON
Categories: Fish, Grilled foo
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Whole salmon fillet -- * see
Note
2 tb Butter -- melted
3 tb Honey -- melted
1 tb Dill weed
2 c  Alder wood chips -- opt
Have the samon filleted leaving the skin on. This is important. Keep
cold. Melt together and melt the butter and honey in the micro or
another way. Lay the fillet out skin side down and pour over or
quickly brush on the honey and butter. Sprinkle the dill weed over.
By having the filet cold the honey and butter mixture will congeal
and the filet will be easy to handle. Place the filet skin side UP
over a moderate grill. As soon as the meat just starts to firm up
turn to skin side down. (The skin will keep the filet together)
Remove from the grill as soon as the meat starts to flake. On large
filets I use two spatulas.Serve with a green salad and augratin
potatos.
