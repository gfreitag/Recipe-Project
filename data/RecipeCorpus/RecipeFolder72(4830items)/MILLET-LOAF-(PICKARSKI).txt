**************************************************** *******

Rinse the millet and put it in a medium saucepan with the water and
1/2 teaspoon sea salt.  Cook the millet, covered, over medium heat
for about 30 minutes or until soft; the millet should absorb all of
the water. (If the grains are too moist, the loaf will not bind
properly.)

Saute the carrots, celery, onions, and garlic in oil for 6 minutes, or
until the onions are translucent. Add the seasonings, including the
remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Mix the cooked millet and the
vegetables together, along with the nuts or seeds, if you wish. Mix
the two flours together and add them to the millet mixture, blending
it well so the loaf will hold together.

Lightly oil and flour a large loaf pan.  Press the millet mixture
into the pan and bake in a preheated oven at 400 degrees F for about
one hour. (If the millet mixture is warm when you put it in the pan,
reduce the baking time to about 45 minutes.)  Allow the loaf to cool
for 10 minutes, then carefully remove it from the pan. To avoid
breaking the loaf, you may wish to slice it while it is still in the
pan.
