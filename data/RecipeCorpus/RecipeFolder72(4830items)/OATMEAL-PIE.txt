Star OATMEAL PIE

Cream together butter and sugar. Add cinnamon, cloves and salt. Stir
in syrup. Add eggs, one at a time, stirring after each addition until
blended. Stir in rolled oats. Pour into pie shell and bake in
moderate oven (350~ F) about 1 hour, or until knife inserted in

Pie is rich, delicately spiced.
