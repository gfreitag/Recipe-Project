Categories: Desserts, Hungary
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Flour
2 ea Tb brandy
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 lb Butter or margerine
1 ts Baking powder
3 ea Eggs
2 ea To 3lb hrtnng .milk
Powdered sugar
Cream the butter (margerine) and sugar.  Add the eggs, milk, brandy,
salt, and baking powder. Gradually add the flour until the dough is
not sticky. Put dough on a board and knead in any remaining flour.
Wrap in plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for a few hours or
overnight.... makes it MUCH easier to roll. Cut dough into small
sections, covering all but the one you are working on. Roll dough out
to 1/16" thickness. Cut out pieces about 3. " to 4" long and about
1-1/2" wide. Make a slit about 1-1/2" long down the center of each
piece and pull one end through the slit so that the sides twist.
Deep fry about six pieces at a time until golden in color and drain
on paper towels. Avoid the urge to speed things up by doing more at
one time... you will only cool the shortening too fast and end up
with a heavier, less crisp result. Sprinkle lavishly with powdered
sugar when cool.  Enjoy! By the way, the brandy is important for more
than just flavoring.  When the pieces of dough hit the hot
shortening, the brandy vaporizes and forces its way out of the dough,
preventing shortening from getting in, making for a much lighter
result. As you can guess, this gets pretty frantic with only one
person doing it; for best results, and more fun, work with a friend,
one person rolling and cutting, the other person frying. OGTZFAK
