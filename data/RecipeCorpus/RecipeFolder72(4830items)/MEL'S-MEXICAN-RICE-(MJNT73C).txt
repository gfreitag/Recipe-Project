Title: MEL'S MEXICAN RICE (MJNT73C)
Categories: Side dish, Beans, Mexican
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Long-grain rice;uncooked*
2    Cloves garlic; crushed
1/4 c  Corn oil
5 c  Chicken broth; **
* NOT Uncle Ben's converted type or the precooked type. ** When using
substitutions (see below) always remember to keep the proportions of
rice to liquid the same. Heat the oil on med-high in a large skillet
or 4-5 quart pot. Add the garlic and sautee about 1 minute. Add the
rice and fry it, stirring frequently, until the rice is golden brown.
Add the liquid and stir. When it comes to a boil, lower to a simmer,
stir once more and cover. Cook until all water is absorbed. This is
the basic recipe, and there is a lot more you can do with it. For
example: Substitute 1/2 cup tomato juice, or a pureed tomato, for
part of the liquid. Substitute part of the liquid with black bean
soup broth. Add 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots. Add 1/2 cup sliced
mushroom and green onion. Use beef or other broth instead of chicken.
Add 1/2 cup cooked chick peas(garbanzo). Substitute part of the rice
with some vermicelli. The possibilities are really endless if you use
your imagination. Just stick to the basic recipe and proportion of
rice to liquid. From Melanie Miguel
