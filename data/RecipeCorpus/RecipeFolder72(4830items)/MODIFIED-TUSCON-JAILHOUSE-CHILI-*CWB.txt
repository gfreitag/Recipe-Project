Title: MODIFIED TUSCON JAILHOUSE CHILI *CWB
Categories: Chili, Crockpot
Yield: 1 Servings  ***A VERY HOT CHILI***

Serves six to eight

INGREDIENTS

2 pounds lean ground beef 6 cloves garlic 1 can (four ounces) diced
green chilies (Casa Fiesta brand) 1 can (four ounces) nacho-sliced
jalapeno peppers (Casa Fiesta brand) 6 TBS chili powder 1 can (six
ounces) Hunt's tomato paste 1 can (sixteen ounces) diced tomatoes 1
TBS balsamic vinegar 1 TBS Extra-Virgin olive oil 1 can (twenty one
ounces) Bush's Best pinto beans, drained 1 whole bay leaf 3 ts ground
cumin 1 ts salt 1 ts pepper 2 TBS brown sugar 1 large yellow onion
weighing about one pound

PREPARATION

Dice onion, and puree garlic.  To puree garlic, put a clove under a
knife blade, hit the blade, which will remove the peel, then dice the
clove, add a little salt, and crush the diced clove under the blade
of a heavy knife until pureed.

Saute onions in olive oil; when onions clear, add garlic puree. Stir
quickly (less than a minute) to avoid onions browning. Remove sauteed
onions and garlic from skillet. Brown beef in skillet; drain well. Add
sauteed onions and garlic, stir quickly, then pour into crockpot. Add
all other ingredients and stir. Cook eight hours on low, four hours
on high.

OPTIONAL: Best cooled and re-heated.  Garnish with grated sharp
Cheddar cheese and sliced green onions; serve with corn chips.
To use dried instead of canned beans, soak two and two-thirds cups
(one pound) pinto or kidney beans overnight in three times their
volume of water. Add salt to the water the next morning, and
slowly bring to a boil.  Boil ten minutes, cover, and let simmer
for two hours until beans are tender.  Drain before using in
recipe. Family Circle Great Ideas, Vol 12, No. 4, originally posted
