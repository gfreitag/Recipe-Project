3    Eggs (extra-large)
1/3 c  Green onions; chopped

Preheat oven to 450.  Bake pastry shell for 5 minutes; remove to

For filling, in a bowl whisk together milk and eggs. Stir in onions,

pastry shell. Bake at 325 for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan
steam broccoli spears over simmering water for 5 minutes. Drain; set

before baking.  226 calories per serving.
