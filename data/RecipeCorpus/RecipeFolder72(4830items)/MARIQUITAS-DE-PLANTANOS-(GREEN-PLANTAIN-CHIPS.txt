Title: MARIQUITAS DE PLANTANOS (GREEN PLANTAIN CHIPS
Categories: Snacks, Cuba, Update
Yield: 2 Servings
2 lg Green plantains, peeled and
-cut into paper-thin slices
Peanut or vegetable oil for
-deep frying
Salt to taste
1 ea Place the plantain slices
-in a bowl, cover them with
-cold water, and
soak 30 minutes. (If you are frying right away, you do not need to
soak in water.) 2. Drain the slices and pat dry with paper towels. In
a frying pan or deep fryer over medium-high heat, heat 2 to 3 inches
of oil to 375 degrees, or until a slice of plantain sizzles when it
touches the oil, and fry the plantain chips a handful at a time,
turning them with a slotted spoon until they are golden brown and
crisp. Do not fry too many chips at once, or the oil temperature will
fall and the chips will be soggy rather than crisp. Drain on a
paper-towel-lined platter, transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with
salt, and serve hot. Makes 2 to 2 1/2 cups of chips Mary Urrutia
