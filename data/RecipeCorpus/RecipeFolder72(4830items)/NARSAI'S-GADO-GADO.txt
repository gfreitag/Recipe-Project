This is from Narsai David, a Bay Area restaurateur and food critic.
Haven't tried it yet, but most of the stuff Narsai comes up with is
great. Gado Gado is an extremely good Indonesian way to consume
veggies even if you're not too fond of 'em.  This calls for raw
veggies, but more authentic recipes call for blanching the veggies
first. This is probably for sanitary purposes more than anything.

Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the onion and garlic and saute
until they are brown.  Add the consomme, soy sauce, peanut butter,
cream, ginger and Tabasco sauce and cook slowly for about 10 minutes.
Puree the mixture in blender or food processor.

The dip may be served warm or cold with an assortment of raw
vegetables of your choice..

Serves 6.

NOTE:  If this dish is to be served cold, double the amount of
consomme to 2 cups.

From the San Francisco Chronicle, date unknown.
