yogurt and place over bowl. Refrigerate and drain for at least 10
hours. Before continuing with recipe, carefully remove cheesecloth

teaspoon salt. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for

Pour into a 9-inch nonstick pie plate and spread evenly over bottom

Parmesan cheese. Bake 25 minutes or until pie is bubbling hot
throughout. Remove from oven and top with basil.
