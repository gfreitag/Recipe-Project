Title: MR. FOOD'S AMERICAN GOULASH
Categories: Casseroles
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Ground beef Up to 2lbs
1/2 md Green bell pepper, chopped
1 sm Onion, chopped
28 oz Spaghetti sauce
1 tb Garlic salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
8 oz Uncooked elbow macaroni
1/2 c  Water
=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 350 F. In a large skillet,
brown the ground beef, bell pepper, and onion over medium-high heat
for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring to crumble the beef, and cook until no
pink remains in the beef; drain off the excess liquid. Add the
remaining ingredients except the cheese; mix well. Place in a 2 1/2
quart casserole dish that has been coated with nonstick vegetable
spray; cover and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and top
with the mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 more
minutes, or until heated through and the cheese has melted. Note:
This is a perfect dish to make ahead and freeze. You can even freeze
it in individual portions. That way the kids can microwave a dish
after school or anytime they need a quick meal.
