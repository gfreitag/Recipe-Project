1/2" round cutter. Brush each dough round with some of the melted
butter or margarine. Make an off-center crease in each round. Fold
each round along the crease so the large half is on top. Press folded
edges firmly. Place rolls, 2-3" apart on baking sheets. Cover and let
rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake in
a 375=B0 oven for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. (Makes 36
