Title: MARION'S GLAMORGAN SAUSAGES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lg Onions, chopped finely
5 oz Wholemeal breadcrumbs
4 oz Cheddar cheese, grated
-(and vegetarian, of course)
1/4 ts Mustard powder
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt (optional)
Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl adding a sprinkling
of water or milk if it doesn't stick together (the original recipe
uses and egg yolk but I don't). If you've got a food
blender/processor everything will stick together better.

Take a large spoonful of the mixture and dip it into flour then roll
it out into a sausage (or whatever shape you fancy). Coat your hands
in flour too so it doesn't stick to you so much.

Then shallow fry them for 5-10 mins - extra virgin olive oil if you
can (it smells sooooo good)

If you've got too many sausages, cover refrigerate them - they'll
keep for a day or two.  Or fry them anyway - they're just as good
cold.
