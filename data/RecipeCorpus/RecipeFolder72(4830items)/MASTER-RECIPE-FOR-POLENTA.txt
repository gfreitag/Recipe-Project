Title: MASTER RECIPE FOR POLENTA
Categories: Grains, Italian
Yield: 7 Servings
Salt
2 c  Coarse italian cornmeal
*Use this recipe to make the basic polenta required for preparing the
"Polenta `Lasagne' with Beef, Tomato, and Red Wine Sauce", "Soft
Polenta with Porcini Mushroom Sauce", and "Polenta Crostini with Tuna
Butter and Capers."  Many of these dishes require that you cook the
polenta, cool it, and cut it into squares. However, the soft polenta
prepared to serve with Porcini Mushroom sauce has a looser texture.
If you find that the polenta made from this master recipe is too
stiff for the soft polenta and mushroom dish, stir in 1/4 c boiling
water to "loosen" it. TO COOK: Bring 7 c water to boil in a large
saucepan. Add 1T salt. Stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden
spoon, add cornmeal in a slow, constant steam o prevent lumps from
forming.  Simmer, stirring consntly until polenta is very thick and
creamy and pulls awarom the sides of the pan, 25 to 30 min. Proceed
immediately a ructed in the individual recipes. MICROWAVE VERSION:
(Just as good but er) Put 1 T salt, the cornmeal, c water in a 4 qt
microwave-safe bowl.  Cover and chis mixture on high power, stirring
every 6 min until cr 24 min in all. Proceed immediately as your are
ucted in the individual recipe of your choice. Makes 7 cups. *
Because polenta contanly cornmeal, salt, and water, the texture of
the cornme important. Unless you have access to a specialty foop or
want to use mail order, the exact texture of the cornme  you find
taly is unavailable in the US.
To find out how to best approximate Italian po, using cornmeal that
is available here, COOK'S tried m it with fine-ground, coarse-ground,
and an equal re of the two types (in all cases, Goya brand meal wad).
