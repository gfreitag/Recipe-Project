Olio di Arrosto: Heat the oil with all the other ingredients and cook,
stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes or until garlic is quite brown. Add a few
drops of water or white to produce the steam which will bind the
flavours to the oil. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard the
garlic and fresh herbs by simply lifting them with a fork. If you
used dried herbs, strain the oil, but be sure that the salt and
pepper are not removed. Note: You may add a shank bone or any other
bone for a more authentic flavor. YIELDS: 1/2 CUP Meat Sauce: (Sugo
di Carne) Place the olio di arrosto in a large saucepan. Chop onion,
carrot, celery, and parsley together, very fine. Add to saucepan,
with oil and lightly brown for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add meat and brown thoroughly, stirring frequently.
Add wine and raise the heat to let the wine evaporate completely.
Add the tomato paste and cook over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes,
stirring frequently.
Add beef stock or water and cook, covered, over very low heat for
