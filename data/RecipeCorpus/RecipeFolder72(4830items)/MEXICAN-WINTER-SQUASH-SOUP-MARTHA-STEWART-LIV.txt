1. Rinse squash, trim ends, cut in half lengthwise, and discard
strings and seeds. Put into a saucepan with stock, cutting again if
necessary, to make squash fit into pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
to low, and simmer, covered, until just tender, about 20 minutes.
Remove squash, and when it is cool enough to handle, cut away skin
with a small, sharp knife and chop flesh into roughly 1-inch squares.

2. In a large, heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan, warm butter over
medium-low heat. Add leeks and 1/4 t salt, and cook until tender,
about 45 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and chile powder, and cook for 1
minute.

3. Add reserved squash and stock, tomatoes, chipotles, cilantro
bottoms, remaining salt, and pepper to taste, and bring to a boil.
Cook over low heat for 30 minutes. Puree in a blender or food
processor.

4. Return soup to saucepan and through. Garnish each serving with a
tea- spoon of sour cream and chopped cilantro.
