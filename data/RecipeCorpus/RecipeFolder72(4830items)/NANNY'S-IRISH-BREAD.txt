Title: NANNY'S IRISH BREAD
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
4 c  All Purpose Flour
3 ts Baking Powder
1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
1 c  Sugar
16 oz Sour Cream
3 ea Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 x  Raisins-as much as you like
Mix together all dry ingredients: the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
baking soda. In a separate bowl, mix together all wet ingredients:
the sour cream, eggs, and vanilla. Now mix the dry ingredients into
the wet ingredients. Mix thoroughly. Should be a slightly sticky
dough texture. Add the raisins to taste. My family likes a lot of
raisins, so I put in enough so that there's a raisin in almost every
bite! Bake at 325 degrees for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until skewer
comes out clean.
