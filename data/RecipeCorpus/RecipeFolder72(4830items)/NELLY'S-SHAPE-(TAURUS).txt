Title: NELLY'S SHAPE (TAURUS)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 c  Milk
3 1/2 ts Gelatin
4    Eggs, separated
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Sweet sherry
2 tb Marmalade
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Toasted slivered almonds
Servings:  6

Place 3 tbsp milk in large bowl, sprinkle gelatin over milk. Let soak
while you prepare custard.

Mix egg yolks with sugar in top of double boiler, place over barely
simmering water, mix in remaining milk. Stir continuously until
mixture thickens into a custard. Remove from heat and immediately
pour over softened gelatin, stir, so gelatin becomes thoroughly mixed
in. Mix in the sherry and chill for 20 to 30 minutes.

Beat egg whites until they form soft peaks, fold into custard. Turn
into serving dish and chill for several hours. The custard will
separate, leaving a foamy top and a jelly bottom.

Place the marmalade in a small saucepan and warm it very gently over
low heat.  Spread it evenly over the top of the pudding. Turn the
cream into a bowl and beat it stiff. Spread over marmalade, sprinkle
with nuts.

The sensual and seductive taste of this dessert should satisfy the
Taurean's love of things both sweet and pleasurable, its pale soft
topping suggesting the foamy waves of the sea from which Venus was
born.
