Title: OATBURGERS
Categories: Low-fat, Main dish
4 c  water
Yield: 12 Burgers
1/2 c  soy sauce
1/2 c  nutritional yeast
1    large onion diced
1/2    Tbs garlic powder
1/2    Tbs Italian seasoning
4 1/2 Cups old fashioned rolled oats.

Bring to a boil all ingredients except the oats. (I use a 3 quart
pot, why do you ask?) Turn heat to low and stir in 4 1/2 cups rolled
oats. Cook for about 5-10 minutes until the water is absorbed. Don't
overcook. Not a major warning here, but if it is too soupy, add some
oats at about 5 minutes and cook for a few more minutes instead of
cooking it longer. I haven't had to add any oats the last 5 or 10
times I've made this). Fill a rectangular non-stick baking pan with
the mixture (we are making square burgers here, a lot easier than
forming little circles). Your pan should be anywhere from 9x18 or
larger. Depends upon how thick you want them. I like them about 1/2
of an inch thick. I wouln't make them any thinner, because they'll be
tough and will dry out . (Note: I wrote everything down but the pan
size when I made these the last time, and I usually fill one or two
of whatever is clean. You may need two pans. Sorry.) Total cooking
time is 45 minutes. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes. Then use a utensil
that won't scratch your pan to cut the giant burger into little
burgers, and flip them. Cook another 20 minutes. Taste great hot or
cold.
