Title: MY BUBBE'S BLINTZAS
Categories: Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM----------------------BLETLACH (LEAVES---------------------------
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Flour
1 c  Water
4    Egg
Butter
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 lb Cottage cheese
1    Egg yolk
1 tb Sugar
1 pn Salt
Sift the flour with the salt and salt.   Beat eggs well, add water.
Add flour gradually to eggs, stirring constantly, until batter is
smooth and thin. Heat a small frying pan, Teflon makes life easy, and
smear with a very thin coat of butter. When pan is hot, put in about
1/4 cup batter, tilt pan until it covers. Cook until it begins to
blister and is shiny. Turn out on table cloth. I always use one, but
I guess you can use paper towels. Continue until all the batter is
used. Should make 10 or 12 circles.

Mix the filling ingredients well. Now it's time to 'build your
blintzas' as my daughter used to say. Put some filling off center on
each circle. Fold the bottom up and the top down. Tuck in sides, or
fold in, before you put the op down. Confused? Just try it, it's easy.

At this point you can store them  in  the fridge, or freeze them. They
freeze well. To finish, just fry them in a small amount of butter,
until browned

Great, served with sour cream. They are a bit complicated, but not
really difficult. and they freeze so well. Use well seasoned pams, 6".
