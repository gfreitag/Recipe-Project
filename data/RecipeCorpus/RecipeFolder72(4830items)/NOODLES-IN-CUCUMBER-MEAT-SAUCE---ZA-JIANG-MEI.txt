PREHEAT A WOK OR SAUCEPAN over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot,
lightly brown the pork; break up clumps. Add rice wine; stir together
for 1 minute or until the pork is dry. Push meat up the sides of the
wok. Add ginger, garlic and half the green onions to the center of
the wok; saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the hoisin
sauce, hot bean paste, sugar and soy sauce to the center; stir-fry
until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Mix the sauce with the pork, add
chicken stock and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce to simmer and
continue cooking, stirring occasionally until sauce has thickened
into the consistency of spaghetti sauce, about 10 minutes. Swirl in
half of the sesame oil. Keep warm. Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil.
Separate strands by gently pulling the ball of noodles apart. Add
noodles to boiling water; stir with a pair of chopsticks. When water
reaches the second boil, add 1 cup cold water and let it come to a
boil again. Pour into a colander. Rinse with cold water. Drain
thoroughly and set aside. Toss with remaining tablespoon sesame oil
and remaining green onions. Divide noodles among 6 flat soup plates
or bowls. Spoon meat sauce on top. Garnish with cucumber, black
sesame seeds and fresh coriander leaves.
