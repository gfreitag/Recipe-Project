Title: MIKE'S BBQ SAUCE FOR RIBS
Categories: Bbq sauces
Yield: 1 Batch
10 1/2 oz Can Campbell's beef broth
-plus one can water
6 oz Can tomato paste
1/2 c  Worchestershire sauce
1 T  Liquid smoke
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Gulden's mustard
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 T  Chile powder
1 t  Habenero hot sauce
Throw  all the ingrediants into a pot, mix and bring to the point
where it just starts to boil.  I guess a very gentle simmer would be
a good term for it.  You want some of the liguid to boil off, but you
do not want to burn the sauce.  Cook uncovered until you reach the
consistency that you would like.  I'll usually cook for about 4
hours, stiring quite a bit.

If you like a thicker sauce, leave out some of the water.

If you don't like to sweat with your ribs, you might cut down on the
amount of chili powder and/or the hot sauce.
