Title: MICROWAVE YOGURT
Categories: Dairy
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Lowfat or skim milk
1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk (optional)
2 tb Fresh yogurt
Pour the milk into a quart glass container.  If you want to add
nonfat dry milk to make the yogurt "creamier" now's the time. Heat in
microwave until the milk reaches about 175 degrees. (Takes about 9
minutes.) Remove from microwave and cool until the milk reaches about
100 degrees. Add two tablespoons active yogurt. Stir well, a whisk is
good. Cover with plastic wrap.  Wrap in a towel. Replace bowl in
microwave. Heat on low about 30 seconds. Heat on low 30 seconds every
30-60 minutes for about 4 hours. You'll have yogurt. If you walk away
all day but leave it nice and warm, it'll turn into yogurt, too, but
will take longer. And since you won't be there, you won't notice.
Refrigerate and laugh at Dannon's high prices.
