2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
2 ts Shortening
2/3 c  -Water, lukewarm
Vegetable oil; for frying
Jam, honey, or powdered
-sugar
In a med. bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt; cut in
shortening until mixture has the appearance of fine crumbs. Sprinkle
in water, 1 tbsp at a time.  Use a fork to toss until the flour is
moistened and dough almost cleans side of bowl.  Dough should be
soft, but not sticky. On a lightly floured surface, knead until
smooth. Form into ball, cover, and refrigerate 30 mins.  Heat oil in
a lg. skillet to 400~. Tear off a piece of dough about the size of a
peach. Pat and stretch until thin and round, about 6" to 8" in
diameter. Poke a hole through the middle, and drop into sizzling
vegetable shortening.  Fry circles, turning once, until golden brown,
about 1 min. on each side. Bread will puff beautifully. Serve with
jam, honey, or powdered sugar.

Note - in New Mexico at fairs, craft shows, and Indian Pow Wows,
you'll see long lines of people waiting to get their hot fry bread.
Folklore tells us that poking a hole in the center lets out the evil
spirits.
