Soak beans overnight in plenty of water to cover. Drain beans and
combine in a pot with the 2 quarts water, onion and bay leaf. Bring
to a boil and skim off any foam that rises. Reduce heat, cover, and
simmer for 1 hour. Add 2 tsp. salt; continue to simmer. Heat olive
oil in a large saucepan or non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and
add the leeks. Cook, stirring, until leeks soften, about 5 minutes.
Add the pumpkin and garlic and sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. salt. Continue
to cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pumpkin begins to
soften. Ladle in some stock from the beans.  Stir together and
transfer the pumpkin mixture to the bean pot. Cover and simmer 30 to
50 minutes, until the beans are thoroughly tender, even mushy.
Taste; adjust salt and add pepper. Remove the bay leaf and cloves
from the onion. Return the onion to the soup. Put the soup through
the fine or medium blade of a food mill and return to the heat. Stir
in the slivered sage and heat through gently, stirring. Serve,
garnishing each bowl with additional fresh sage.
