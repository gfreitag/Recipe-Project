wait 30 seconds.  Set bowl of chocolate in pan of water. Stir
chocolate mixture until melted and smooth.  Or, melt in a microwave
on LOW (30%) for about 2.5 minutes.  Remove chocolate from heat and

into mold, glasses, or onto dessert that it will enhance. The mousse
sets quickly and should not be manipulated too much. Cover and

* A Note About Coffee:

This is from the Cocolat book.  I trust Alice, you should too.

"Normally, to use it properly as a flavoring, we require maximum
taste with minimum liquid.  Rather than use coffee extract or
flavoring from a bottle, I use one of the premium brands of instant
coffee or espresso powder (but NOT freeze dried crystals).  Two
brands that I like are Medaglio d'Oro and Cafe Salvador.

"If (like me) you are too much of a coffee snob to ever dream of
actually drinking instant coffee, you are probably thinking of using
strong brewed coffee or real espresso. I recommend against this. [It]
will deliver too much liquid and not enough flavor.  So, relax this
time and open the jar."
