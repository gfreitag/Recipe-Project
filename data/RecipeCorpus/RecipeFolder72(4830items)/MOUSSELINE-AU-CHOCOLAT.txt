Title: MOUSSELINE AU CHOCOLAT
Categories: Mousse
Yield: 6 Servings
4    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Sugar -- extra fine
1/4 c  Orange liqueur
6 oz Semisweet chocolate
4 tb Strong coffee
1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter --
Softened
1/4 c  Orange peel  -- glazed --
Optional
4    Egg whites
1 pn Salt
1 tb Sugar
2 c  Creme anglaise -- vanilla
Flavored OR
Whipped cream -- sweetened
Beat the egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture is thick, pale
yellow and falls back upon itself forming a slowly dissolving ribbon.
Beat in the orange liqueur. Set mixing bowl over not-quite-simmering
water and continue beating for 3-4 minutes until the mixture is foamy
and too hot for your finger.  Then beat over cold water for 3-4
minutes until the mixture is cool and again forms the ribbon. It will
have the consistency of mayonnaise. Melt the chocolate with coffee
over hot water. Remove from heat and beat in the butter a bit at a
time, to make a smooth cream. Beat the chocolate into the egg yolks
and sugar, then beat in the optional orange peel.  Beat the egg
whites and salt until soft peaks are formed sprinkle on the sugar and
beat until stiff peaks are formed. Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into
the chocolate mixture. Fold in the rest. Turn into serving dish,
dessert cups or petits pots. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or
overnight. Pass the sauce or whipped cream separately. Source:
