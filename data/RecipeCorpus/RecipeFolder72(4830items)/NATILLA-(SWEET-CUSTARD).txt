Title: NATILLA (SWEET CUSTARD)
Categories: Desserts, Cuba, Update
Yield: 6 Servings
8 lg Egg yolks
4 c  Milk
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
Cinnamon for dusting or 1 cup sugar for the crust 1. In a bowl, mix
the egg yolks with 1 cup of the milk. In another bowl, mix the
cornstarch with another cup of milk, then add the sugar and the
remaining milk. Strain the egg-yolk mixture through a fine strainer
into the cornstarch mixture and stir to combine well. 2. In a heavy,
medium-size saucepan over medium heat, cook the mixture, stirring
constantly, until thickened, 20 minutes. Remove from heat, add the
vanilla, and stir to blend. 3. Pour into a serving bowl, let cool to
room temperature, cover, and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. Before
serving, dust with cinnamon. If you are caramelizing the custard,
cook the sugar in a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring
constantly after it starts to bubble, until it is golden brown, 6 to
8 minutes. Drizzle it over the custard and refrigerate until the
caramel sets. If you want a crisp sugar crust, pour the custard into
an ovenproof mold, and refrigerate as directed above. Before serving,
sprinkle the sugar over the top, and place under a preheated broiler
just until the sugar melts. Watch closely, as the sugar burns
quickly. Serve within 10 to 15 minutes. Makes 6 to 8 servings NATILLA
