1 cn Solid-pack tuna; drained
8 oz Elbow macaroni; cooked
4 tb Butter
2 tb Onion; minced
1 1/2 tb Green pepper; minced
2 tb Flour (instant)
3/4 ts Salt

1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Frozen green peas; (opt)
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
1 c  Sharp cheddar cheese;
-shredded, divided
2 sl Bread; buttered and cubed
Paprika; generous sprinkle
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cook macaroni until tender, drain. Melt
butter in same pot, add onions and green pepper and saute over low
heat 5 minutes. Add flour, salt and pepper and stir to blend well.
Add milk and mushroom soup and stir over low heat until smooth. Add
macaroni, flaked tuna, peas and 1/2 the cheese to sauce and stir to
blend well. Pour into 2-quart buttered casserole, top with remaining
cheese. Top cheese with 2 slices battered day-old bread cut in cubes,
and sprinkle bread with paprika generously. Bake at 350 degrees for
35 minutes, or until nice and brown. This casserole reheats easily
over low heat in saucepan, or in microwave at 50%.  Like most
casseroles, it tastes even better reheated.
