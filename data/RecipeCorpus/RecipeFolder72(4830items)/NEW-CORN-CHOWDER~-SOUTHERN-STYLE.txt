1    Leek
1/2    Carrot; cut lengthwise
1    Stalk celery; chopped
1/4    Bay leaf
1 pn Sage
1 pn Thyme
2    Thick slices bacon, diced
1 c  New corn pulp

"The key to this delicious soup is to gently scrape the kernels off
the corn cob with a table fork so the skins remain on the cob,
leaving you with only the fresh pulp."

Use a 12" square of cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni of the
first 7 ingredients and set aside.  In a large saucepan over medium
heat, first soften the bacon, then add the corn, onions, and celery
and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken broth,
potatoes, tomatoes, and the bouquet garni. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat and slow boil for 1 hour. Remove the bouquet garni. Add the
cayenne pepper. Meanwhile, using your fingers, dissolve the
cornstarch in heavy cream at room temperature. Add cornstarch/cream
mixture to soup and stir until heated through.

This recipe comes from the A. T. &  S. F.  RR.
