Title: MY CINNAMON RAISIN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
MMMMM--------------------MM BY HELEN PEAGRAM-------------------------
2 1/2 c  Milk
2 oz Fresh yeast OR
2 tb Dried yeast
3 1/2 oz Sugar
2 ts Cinnamon (or to taste)
2 lb Strong plain flour (bread)
1 ts Salt
3 1/2 oz Margarine or Butter
1/2 c  Raisins (or to taste)
Place the milk and margarine in a saucepan ( I use microwave) and heat
gently until butter melts. MIx the yeast and sugar together in the
mixing

bowl. Cream the yeast and sugar with a little warm milk. (the milk
should

be at blood heat of 99 F)

Add the remaining liquid at 98.6 F, the flour and the salt and
commence kneading the mixture at speed 2. Cut dough in half and roll
each half out

on lightly floured surface. Sprinkle half of raisins on each rolled
out half and roll up. Place each shaped loaf in pan. Allow to rise
until the dough is double its original size and bake at 375 for 30-35
minutes.

This is a delicious sweet bread and great toasted.  I doubt I will
ever buy raisin bread again.  Too easy to make my own now.
