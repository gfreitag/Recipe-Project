Title: MISO SOUP (BROWN)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Water
1    Inch piece of kombu, rinsed
1    Handful of hijiki, wakame,
Arame - your choice
1    Tub of White Wave lowfat
Tofu
1    Onion coarsely chopped
2    Carrots sliced
1/8    To 1/4 cup miso paste (I
Like the brown best)
Rinse the kombu (kelp; you can get it in health food stores in the
Macrobiotic section or in an Asian market) and put it in the water in
a large pot.  Add the seaweed(s) of your choice. I always add wakame;
hijiki tastes too strong for some people, but I love that too. Bring
to a boil.

While you're boiling the water, you can water, saute the onion, or
just throw it into the water when it's almost at a boil. Turn the
heat way down and add the carrots and the tofu.

Put the miso into a bowl.  Pour some of the water from the pot over
it (you kill some of the miso's good stuff if you boil it, so you
shouldn't put it into the boiling water). Stir the miso thoroughly
into the water and then add this back to the pot. Miso is really high
in sodium, so you can adjust how much you add to taste. My
macrobiotic cookbook says 1 tsp. per cup of water, but that tastes
_really_ light to me.

Remove the kombu piece (it's the tough one) and serve. I put brown
rice in mine, since I don't like to eat brown rice plain.

This soup has all kinds of items that the macrobiotic people say will
cure you of cancer (thinking of an older digest question). Both miso
and the seaweed are supposed to be excellent for your health
according to Michio Kushi, et al.  YMMV.
