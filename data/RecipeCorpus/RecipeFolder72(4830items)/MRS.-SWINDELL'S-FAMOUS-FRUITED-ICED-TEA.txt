"At one time, I intended to teach law, so I went to Boston to get a
Master's of Law degree; while there I lived with the Swindells
family. Mrs. Swindells made a superb iced tea with a pronounced
citrusy flavor. She insisted on using bottle spring water for a clear
tasting iced tea, the sweetest and most flavored oranges and English
Breakfast Tea."

In saucepan, combine sugar and spring water and bring to a boil;
continue to boil until liquid is clear, about 5 minutes. Chill
thoroughly. Place tea bags in heat-resistant pitcher, add boiling
water and let steep for about 5 minutes. Remove and discard tea bags.
Let cool and refrigerate until chilled. Add orange juice, lemon juice
and pineapple juice and chilled sugar syrup. Refrigerate for a few
hours, preferably overnight. Serve over ice in tall glasses.
