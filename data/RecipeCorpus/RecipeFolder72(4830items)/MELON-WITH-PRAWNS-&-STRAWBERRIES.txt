For the dressing:
8 oz Strawberries
1 ts Caster sugar
2 ts Olive oil
1 tb Unsweetened orange juice
2 ts Chopped fresh parsley
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
Freezing: not recommended
Preparation time: 20 minutes

Peel and chop the avocado and place it in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle it
with the lemon juice to prevent it from discolouring.

Halve the melon, discard the seeds and scoop out the flesh using a
melon baller (or cut it into cubes).
Gently combine the melon, chopped celery, strawberries and prawns
with the avocado and refrigerate until needed.

Meanwhile, puree the dressing ingredients in a food processor or
liquidiser. Arrange the lettuce on 4 plates and divide the prawn
mixture between them. Pour the dressing over and serve immediately.

Cook's notes: when melons are ripe they should 'give' slightly when
pressed at the stalk end.

Wrap up melons well if storing them in the refrigerator as otherwise
they will permeate everything around them with their heady scent.
