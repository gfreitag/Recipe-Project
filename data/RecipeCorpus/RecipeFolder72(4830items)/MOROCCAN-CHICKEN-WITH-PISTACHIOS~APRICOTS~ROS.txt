*Make certain you use a pot marigold (Calendula) rather than an
African marigold (Tagetes) Cook the rice in boiling, salted water for
15-20 minutes, or until just tender; it should still be a little
chewy. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan, put in the onions and fry
quickly for 2 minutes. Add the apricots, pistachios, pine kernels,
sprinkling them with cinnamon as they cook. Using a slotted spoon,
remove the mixture from the pan and stir into the rice. Cover and
keep warm. Heat the remaining oil, put in the chicken strips and fry
quickly, sprinkling with a little more cinnamon. Do not overcook the
chicken, which should be tender and juicy. Mix the cooked chicken
into the rice, season if necessary and spread the mixture in a wide
shallow dish. Sprinkle with rose water and decorate with the rose and
marigold petals. Serve at once.
