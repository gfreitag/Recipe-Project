Title: MUSHROOM CASSEROLE WITH WILD RICE
Categories: Casserole, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Wild rice, washed
350 lg Mushrooms, sliced
75 g  Butter
175 g  Tomatoes, skinned & chopped
5 tb Single cream
5 tb Soured cream or yogurt
Salt, pepper
Lemon juice
Serves 2-3

This delectable casserole of mushrooms, tomatoes and soured cream is
served inside a ring of wild rice. The creamy sauce is mopped up by
the rice and makes a memorable supper dish.

Drain the washed rice, cover with boiling water in a large saucepan
and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5 minutes and leave to stand in the
same water for half an hour. Then drain and cover with fresh water,
and simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the rice is tender but still
crunchy. Drain, and arrange around the edge of a warmed serving-dish.
Cover with foil and keep warm while you prepare the mushrooms.

Cut the mushroom slices into strips and toss in the butter over a
gentle heat for 6-8 minutes until cooked through but not too soft.
Add the single cream and the tomatoes, mix well and simmer together
for a further 4-5 minutes. Stir in the soured cream or yogurt and
heat through gently. Season to taste with salt, pepper and a little
lemon juice.

Place the mushroom mixture in the centre of the serving-dish,
surrounded by the wild rice, and it is ready to serve.
