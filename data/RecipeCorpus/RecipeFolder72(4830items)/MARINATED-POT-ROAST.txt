3 1/2 lb Top, eye or bottom round
-beef
Marinade:
1 c  Red wine
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 tb Worcestershire or soy sauce
1    Onion, finely chopped
1    Clove garlic, finely chopped
2    Carrots, finely chopped
2    Stalks celery, finely
-chopped
3    Sprigs parsley
1/2 ts Thyme
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Peppercorns
The meat will be so tender you can cut it with a fork.

Soak the clay pot in cold water for 10 minutes. Tie the beef with
string in four places so that it will retain its shape as it cooks.
Combine all the marinade ingredients in the clay pot. Marinate the
beef for at least 24 hours, turning the beef several times. Add
sufficient water or beef broth to the marinade to cover 3/4 of the
height of the beef. Place the pot in a cold oven. Adjust the heat to
450 degrees F. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Serve with horseradish.
