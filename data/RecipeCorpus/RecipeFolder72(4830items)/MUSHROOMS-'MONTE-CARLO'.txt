Title: MUSHROOMS 'MONTE CARLO'
Categories: Main dish, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
225 g  Button mushrooms, washed
3 tb Olive oil
1 sm Sprig mint, finely chopped
1    Lemon; juiced
3 tb Parsley, chopped
Salt and pepper
A light, refreshing supper dish that goes beautifully with eggs or on
a bed of rice. Lovely for summer weather, when the cool minty and
lemony flavours come into their own. Delicious hot or cold.

Leave the mushrooms whole if small, otherwise halve or quarter them
according to size. Heat the oil in a heavy pan, add the mushrooms and
cook gently. After 5 minutes, season with salt and pepper and add the
chopped mint and lemon juice. Cook until the liquid is reduced.
Sprinkle with parsley and serve at once with a plain omelette,
scrambled eggs or rice.
