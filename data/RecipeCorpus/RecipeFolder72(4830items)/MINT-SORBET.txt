Title: MINT SORBET
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
6 lg Sprigs of mint
6 tb Sugar
1 1/4 c  Water
Juice of one large lemon
1    Egg white
4    Sprigs mint to decorate
Wash the mint and shake it dry. Heat the sugar and water together
until the sugar is melted.  Add the mint and leave it to steep in the
sugar syrup off the heat for about twenty minutes to half an hour.
Taste it to see if the mint taste has developed enough. If it's not
strong enough you can reheat the mixture to the boil again and then
let it stand for another ten minutes.

When it tastes about right to you, strain the liquid into a rigid
container and add the lemon juice.  Leave to cool, then freeze until
it's semi-frozen (about 45 minutes to an hour). Beat the egg white
until it's stiff enough to stand up in peaks (an electric whisk is
good for this) and fold it gently into the semi-frozen mixture.
Return to the freezer for about an hour. By this time it should have
formed a fairly firm mush. Spoon it into glasses and decorate with
the mint sprigs. You can vary this recipe by using grapefruit juice
instead of lemon and using a bit less water and a bit less mint.
