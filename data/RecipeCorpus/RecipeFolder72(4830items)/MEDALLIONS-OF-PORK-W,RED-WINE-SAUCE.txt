Gourmet -- NY Times. Medallions of Pork with Red-Wine Sauce

Place pork slices on a flat surface. Pound lightly with a mallet.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Combine ginger, thyme, vinegar, bay
leaf, clove, wine, and honey in a bowl and blend well. Place sliced
pork in a dish and pour mixture over it. Marinate for 10 minutes.
Drain the pork medallions and pat dry. Reserve marinate. Place meat
in a single layer in skillet in the hot oil. Cook for 5 minutes, turn
and cook for 5 minutes more over medium high heat. Reduce heat and
cook meat for 2 minutes more. Transfer meat to a dish and keep warm.
In skillet add the shallots and cook stirring until wilted. Add the
reserved marinate and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom. Cook
until marinate is reduced to 3/4 its original amount. Swirl in the
butter and pour the sauce over the medallions. Remove bay leaf and
sprigs of thyme before serving.
