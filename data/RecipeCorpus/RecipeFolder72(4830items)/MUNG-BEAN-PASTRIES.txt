Categories: Bakery, Thai, Desserts, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Dozen
1/2 c  Mung bean flour
3/4 c  Sugar
2 dr Red or green food colouring
1/4 c  Rice flour
3/4 c  Coconut milk
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Yellow mung beans, optional
In a large bowl, combine the mung bean flour, sugar, food colouring &
2 c cold water.  Stir until the flour is almost dissolved. Strain
through cheesecloth into a pot. Over medium heat, stir the liquid
until all remaining solids are completely dissolved & the mixture is
thick & sticky enough to coat a spoon. Cool for 15 minutes. Cover a
baking sheet with waxed paper. Drop the mixture by the spoonful onto
the sheet. Do not allow the circles to touch.  Let cool to room
temperature. In a large bowl, combine the rice flour, milk & salt,
stirring until dissolved. Strain into a pot & cook over medium heat
for 10 minutes. Drop 1 ts of this onto the cooling gelatin circles.
In a dry skillet, toast the yellow mung beans until they turn light
brown. Generously sprinkle onto the pastries & refrigerate for 1 hour
before serving. They will keep in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days.
