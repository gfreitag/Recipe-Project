~------------------------------------------------------
~------------- ~-- Prepare the Casera Sauce; set aside. Mix the eggs,
half-and-half, oregano, salt and pepper with a fork just until the
whites and yolks are blended. Heat the margarine in an 8-inch skillet
or omelet pan over medium-high heat.  As the margarine melts, tilt
the skillet to coat the bottom completely. When the margarine just
begins to brown, the skillet is hot enough to use.  Quickly pour the
egg mixture into the skillet. Slide the skillet back and forth
rapidly over the heat, and at the same time, stir quickly with a fork
to spread the eggs continuously over the bottom of the skillet as
they thicken. Let stand over the heat a few seconds to lightly brown
the bottom of the omelet. (DO NOT overcook; the omelet will continue
to cook after it is folded.  Tilt the skillet; fun the fork under the
edge of the omelet to loosen from the bottom of the skillet. Sprinkle
with the cheese and chiles.  Fold the portion of the omelet nearest
you to the center. (allow for a portion of the omelet to slid up the
side of the skillet.)  Turn omelet out on a warm plate, flipping the
fold portion of the omelet over so the far side is on the bottom.
Tuck the sides of the omelet under if necessary.  Top with the Casera
Sauce and sour cream; sprinkle with fresh, chopped cilantro, if
desired.
