Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1/2 lb Slab bacon
3 tb Butter or light oil of your
-choice
3 tb Flour
4    To 5 cups, scalding hot
-light chicken broth or
-water
2 lb Potatoes, whole if
-fingerlings, or cut up if
-larger, peeled
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper, to taste
1    Mediterranean bay leaf
10    Parsley sprigs, tied into a
-bundle
1    Garlic clove, chopped
3 tb Chopped parsley leaves
For a strong smoked taste, do not blanch the bacon; for a light taste,
blanch it 7 to 8 minutes in cold water.

Cut bacon into 1/2-inch thick slices. Cut slices into 1/3- inch wide
lardoons, crosswise. Put into a cast-iron or enameled cast-iron pot
and render over medium-low heat until light golden. Remove lardoons
to a plate; drain off all fat in pan and replace it with the butter.
Heat well, then add flour and cook to a golden roux, 4 to 5 minutes.
Whisk in chicken broth. Bring to a boil, stirring. Add lardoons,
potatoes, salt and pepper and the herb bundle. Reduce heat to a
simmer, cover (keeping lid slightly askew), and cook 20 to 25
minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Add garlic and parsley.
