Title: MR. FOOD'S ALMOST-STUFFED PORK CHOPS
Categories: Meats, Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
4 ea Pork loin chops 1 inch thick
-1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs total
1 ea Juice of 1 lime about 2 tb
1 1/3 c  Coarsely crumbled
- cracker crumbs
6 oz Fresh mushrooms finely
- chopped (about 1 cup)
3 ea Scallions, chopped
1 tb Dijon-style mustard
1 tb Dried parsley flakes
=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 350 degree F. Brush both
sides of the pork chops with the lime juice and place them in a 9" x
13" baking dish that has been coated with nonstick vegetable spray.
In a medium-sized bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Mix until
well blended then spoon evenly over the top of the shops. Bake for 40
to 45 minutes, or until cooked through. Note: These can be prepared,
covered, and refrigerated overnight before baking. That way, you can
put a fancy dinner in the table without having to do any last-minute
preparation. (Oh, and for a little extra oomph, I sometimes add 1/2
teaspoon dried ground coriander.)
