Title: NO BAKE COOKIES 4
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Margarine
1/2 c  Cocoa
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Peanut butter
2 c  Quick oats
2 c  Coconut
1 ts Vanilla
Mix in large saucepan and bring to boil for 1 minute:

2 cups sugar 1/2 cup cocoa 1/2 cup margarine 1/2 cup milk

Remove from heat and add:

1/2 cup peanut butter 2 cups quick oats 2 cups coconut
1    teaspoon vanilla

Drop by spoonful on buttered cookie sheet or spread into buttered
9X13 pan. Cool, cut and serve.

It is easier if you have the second set of ingredients measured out
before you start.

Make sure you use QUICK oats.  Regular oats will not work. I know
because I've tried.
