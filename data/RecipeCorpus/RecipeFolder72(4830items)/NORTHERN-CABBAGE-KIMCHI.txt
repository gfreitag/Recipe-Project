Preliminaries

Trim off the tougher outer leaves of the celery cabbage and save
them; cut each cabbage head into 2 to 4 sections lengthwise (see
above recipe)

Preparations

1. soak the cabbage sections and the  radishes in a brine prepared
with 3 cups of salt and 4 quarts of water for 3 to 4 hours or until
softened. Rinse with cold water.

2. halve the radishes, reserving 2 and make slit cuts up to 2/3 of the
length from the bottom.

3.  cut the pears into thin julienne strips.

4.  cut the pickled fish and the fresh squid and octopus into 1 1/2"
narrow strips.

5.  cut the 2 remainding radishes into thin julieen; mix the radish
strips with the red pepper paste. Then, add all the remainding
vegtables, mushrooms, and chestnuts along with the octopus, squid,
and pickled fish; mix well. Finally, toss the mixture with oysters
and pear strips and season with salt.  This is the stuffing.

6.  Pack the stuffing between the layers of the cabbage leaves;
filling the slit-cuts on the radishesi. stack the stuffed cabbage and
radishes in a crock; cover with the salted outer leaves
(preliminaries). After 2 or 3 days, add a mixture of salt, pickled
corvina juice, pickled baby shrimp juice, and beef broth, just enough
