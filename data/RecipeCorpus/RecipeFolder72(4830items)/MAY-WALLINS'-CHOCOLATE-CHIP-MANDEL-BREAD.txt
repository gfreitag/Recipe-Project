Title: MAY WALLINS' CHOCOLATE CHIP MANDEL BREAD
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 2 Loaves
3/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Oil
4    Eggs
3 1/2 c  -4 cups flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Almond flavoring
8 oz Shelled walnuts
12 oz Chocolate chips
1. In a large bowl, mix together the sugar, oil and eggs. Add the
sifted flour, baking powder, vanilla and almond extracts, and mix
well. Add the walnuts and the chocolate chips.

2. Mixture should be very thick and sticky. Shape into two loaves and
place on either side of a cookie sheet. Bake at 325F for 30-35
minutes and then remove from oven. Cut into slices while still warm
and return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes, or until slices are
light brown.

Enjoy! These are absolutely WONDERFUL!!! A note: This is a well
guarded secret from a friend of ours who swore she would never give
it to any- one and to this date she hasn't... except to us! ;)
