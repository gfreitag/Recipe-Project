Categories: Wasnone
Yield: 12 Servings
Dough:
1/4 c  Unsalted butter -- 1 1/2
Sticks
1 c  Milk
3/4 c  +  1 tsp  sugar
1 1/4 ts Salt
3    Envelopes active dry yeast
-7 1/2 ts
1/2 c  Warm water
5 lg Eggs
8 1/2 c  To 9 1/2 c. flour

5 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
1 1/4 c  Unsalted butter -- 2 1/2

3 tb Ground cinnamon
Frosting:
1/2 lb Cream cheese -- softened
1/4 c  Whipping cream -- approx.
1 ts Vanilla
3 c  To 4 cups confectioner's
-sugar, sifted
Dough: Heat the butter with the milk, 1/4 cup of the sugar and the
salt in a small saucepan until the butter is melted. Set aside to
cool. In a large mixing bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water,
add the remaining teaspoon sugar, stir and set aside for 10 minutes,
until the mixture is bubbly. Add the lukewarm milk mixture and the
eggs and beat until well combined. Add the flour a cup at a time,
stirring and using enough flour to form a stiff dough. Turn out on a
floured boardl; knead until smooth and satiny, approximately 10
minutes. (Or place in the bowl of an electric mixer and knead with a
dough hook until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl,
approximately 5 minutes.) Place the dough in a very large buttered
bowl, turn to butter the top, and allow to rise, covered loosely with
a kitchen towel, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, approximately
1 hour. Punch the dough down and roll out to a large rectangle,
24x36". Butter two 9x13" glass baking dishes. Filling: Beat together
the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon until well combined. Spread
evenly over the surface of the dough. Roll up lengthwise and cut at
2" intervals to make 12 rolls. Place 6 rolls in each buttered dish.
Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and allow to rise until doubled in
bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350=B0. Bake the rolls for
about 20-30 minutes or until puffed and browned. Cool to room
temperature on racks. Frosting: , beat the cream cheese, cream and
vanilla until well combined. Add the confectioner's sugar and beat
until smooth and soft, not stiff. Frost the rolls and serve
immediately. This makes 12 Large rolls.
