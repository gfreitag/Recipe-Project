1/3 c  Butter Or Margarine;
Softened
1 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1/3 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1/4 c  Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees F.  Grease an 8-inch square baking
pan and set aside.  In a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs and butter
together until fluffy. Beat in the eggs and vanilla, blending well.
Add the flour and beat until smooth.  Pour half of the batter into
the prepared pan and set aside.  Melt the chocolate chips over very
low heat. Add the melted chips to the remaining batter, blending
well.  Spread the chocolate batter over the white batter in the pan.

marble the chocolate into the white. Bake for 25 minutes.  Place the
pan on a wire rack to cool until cold to the touch, before cutting
into squares.
