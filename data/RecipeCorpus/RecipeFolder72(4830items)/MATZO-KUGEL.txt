Title: MATZO KUGEL
Categories: Try it
8    Matzos ~*
Yield: 12 Servings
8    Eggs ~**
1 tb Salt (more or less to suit)
1 ds Pepper (to taste)
1 c  Sugar - some folks use less
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2    Lemon; juice and zest
9 oz Jelly
1 ea Crisco
1 ea Sugar
1 ea Cinnamon

Fill a bowl with water and break matzos up into it, to soak. When you
think they are moist enough (not very long), press out the water as
much as possible without turning the matzos into mush.

In a second bowl, beat eggs, salt and pepper well. Add sugar,
cinnamon, lemon juice and zest, until mixed very well.

Grease the bottom and sides of a 13" X 9" pan heavily with Crisco. Add
matzo to the egg mixture.  Stir carefully to mix. Pour 1/2 of the egg
mixture into the prepared pan. Then put the jelly over that layer.
Pour the remaining egg mixture over the jelly.  Dot 1/2 ts of Crisco
in about 12 places on top of the dish. Then sprinkle with a little
cinnamon and sugar over all.

Bake in a 375^ oven for one hour or until brown and crisp. It will
probably take more than one hour. This makes about 12 servings.

~* and ~**.  If you chose to make a larger recipe, ALWAYS use the same
number of eggs as Matzo, to keep the right consistency. Increase other
ingredients proportionately.

This recipe, though posted by a good gentile girl, has been tasted by
us and enjoyed.  It comes to me by way of my best friend's mother,
who makes this every year for Passover.
