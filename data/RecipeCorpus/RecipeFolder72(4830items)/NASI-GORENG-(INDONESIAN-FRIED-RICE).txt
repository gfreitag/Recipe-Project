advance, along with the vegetable chopping.

In large saucepan or wok, heat oil and saute onion until soft, always
stirring.  Add celery, garlic, ginger, sambal, curry and kecap manis;
saute 2 minutes. Add green pepper and cabbage; saute 3 minutes more.
Add shrimp and chicken, ham, pork or lamb and saute 2 minutes. Add

Enright writes: "Serve with a light beer or ginger tea to quench the
inevitable thirst fired by sambals. Nasi goreng is often served at the
rijsttafel (Dutch for rice table), a feast of spicy dishes, crisp
salads and fresh peanut sauce."
