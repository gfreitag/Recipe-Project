1 lb Butter
4 tb Chopped onion
1 1/2 tb Finely chopped garlic

Niter Kebbeh is a spiced up ghee.  Here is a recipe for it from "The
Africa News Cookbook", published in the US by Viking Penguin.

Slowly melt butter in a saucepan, then bring to boil. When the top is
covered with foam, add the other ingredients and simmer uncovered on
lowest heat until the surface is transparent and milk solids are on
the bottom (45 to 60 minutes).  Pour off the clear liquid and strain
through a double layer of damp cheesecloth, discarding the spices and
solids. Refrigerate. If strained a second and third time, the mixture
will keep either chilled or at room temperature for 2 to 3 months.
