2    Cloves garlic, chopped
1    Or 2 serrano peppers, stems

1/2 cup more stock to form a very thick and smooth puree. Set aside.
(Puree may be made ahead.  Cover and store in the refrigerator.

In a non-aluminum saute pan, combine the mussels, wine and 1 1/2 cups
fish stock.  Cover the pan and bring the liquid to a boil. Steam the
mussels only until the shells are open, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard any
unopened mussels.

Transfer the mussels to a bowl and remove from the shells. (If
desired, save some of the shells to use as a garnish.) Meanwhile, add
the cream to the pan; bring the liquid to a boil and cook until
slightly thickened.

Add 3/4 cup of the cilantro puree to the pan.  Stir to blend. Taste
and, if desired add anothe 1/4 cup. Return the mussels to the broth
in the pan and bring to a simmer. Portion out the soup and mussels,
garnish with a few cilantro leaves and serve at once.

Makes 6 servings.
