Title: MARYLAND FRIED CRAB CAKES (GOOD HOUSEKEEPING)
Categories: Fish/shellf
Yield: 18 Cakes
4 sl Bread
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
1 ds Paprika
1/8 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
2    Eggs
1 tb Parsley, chopped
1 lb Crab flakes
1 lb Claw meat
Trim crust from bread, lay in flat tin or platter and pour olive oil
over them. Let stand 1 hour. Pull apart lightly with two forks. To
the small bits of bread add seasonings, yolks of eggs, and crab meat.
Mix lightly with a fork, fold in stiffly beaten egg whites and shape
into about 18 cakes. Brown in a hot skillet just brushed with fat. If
carefully mixed, these crab cakes will be light and fluffy and of a
delicate flavor. Canned crab meat can of course be used.
