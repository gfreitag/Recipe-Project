2    Cloves garlic finely minced
(2 to 3)
3 c  Hot water
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Flour
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Dried oregano
Salt to taste
Roast chiles in pan or oven due not burn, you will smell them as they
cook and it does not take very long if you burn start over as burn
tends to taste bitter in final sauce. (Enjoy the smell it makes the
sauce all the better). Now place roasted chiles in hot water and let
soak for 30 minutes. Place softened chiles in Cuisart and puree until
smooth. (use half of liquid from soaking). Add rest of ingredients
except oil. puree... Now heat oil in pan until almost smoking then
add puree and cook for a few minutes then strain. This sauce is great
over pork chops especially if they have been marinated over night.
