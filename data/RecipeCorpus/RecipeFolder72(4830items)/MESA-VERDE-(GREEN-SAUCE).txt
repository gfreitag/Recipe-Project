Title: MESA VERDE (GREEN SAUCE)
Categories: Mexican, Salsa
1 lb fresh green chiles -- diced
Yield: 4 Servings
3 TB olive oil
1/3 c  onion -- diced
1 TB salt
1 ts granulated garlic
1 ts dried leaf oregano
2 c  Water
3 TB flour
2 TB vegetable oil

Fresh green chiles make the best salsa, and frozen ones are sometimes
available in supermarkets.  If you can't find either, substitute
canned Ortega Fire-Roasted green chiles. To prepare fresh green
chiles, roast on a barbecue grill, then peel the skins under running
water or by rubbing with a wet towel. Remove stem and seeds before
dicing. Place chiles in a food processor fitted with the metal blade
and process to puree; set aside. Blend flour with vegetable oil.

Place olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add onion and
saute until translucent.  Add salt and spices and reduce heat to
medium. Add the green chile puree, then water. Bring to a slow boil,
stirring occasionally. Add the flour/oil mixture gradually, stirring
constantly, until mixture thickens (you may not need to add all of
it, depending on the amount of juice in the chiles).  Simmer 2
minutes, stirring continually to avoid sticking.  Transfer to a
covered container and refrigerate. Serve chilled. Makes 1 quart.
