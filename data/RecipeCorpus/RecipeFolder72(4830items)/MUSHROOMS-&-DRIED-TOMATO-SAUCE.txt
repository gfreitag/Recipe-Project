Title: MUSHROOMS & DRIED TOMATO SAUCE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 oz Dried porcini
1 c  Boiling water
3    Sun-dried tomatoes
2 ts Fresh rosemary or 1/2
ts Dried
2    Garlic cloves
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 sm Onion, finely diced
White wine for sauteing the
Onion
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms, roughly
Chopped into irregular
Pieces
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
10    To 12 ounces pasta
Soak the tomatoes and porcini in boiling water for about a half hour,
then chop them into small pieces. Reserve the soaking liquid.

Finely chop the rosemary, garlic, and half the parsley together. (This
looks so pretty!)

Saute the mushrooms, tomatoes, onion, and garlic-herb mixture in the
wine for about a minute.  Add salt, a generous amount of pepper, and
cook over medium-high heat until the mushrooms begin to give up their
liquid, after 3-4 minutes.  Carefully pour the soaking liquid from
the mushrooms and tomatoes into the pan (it may have sand on the
bottom). Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer for 15
minutes. Taste for salt and pepper.
