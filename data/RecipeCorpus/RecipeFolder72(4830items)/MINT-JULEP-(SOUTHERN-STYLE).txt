~Robbie Shelton

Into a silver mug or 12 oz Tom Colling glass, dissolve 1 teaspoon
powdered sugar with 2 teaspoons of water. Then fill with finely
shaved ice and add bourbon whiskey. Stir until glass is heavily
frosted adding more ice if necessary.  (Do not hold glass with hand
while stirring.) Decorate with 5 or 6 sprigs of fresh mint so that
the tops are about 2 inches above the rim of mug or glass.  Use short
straws so that it will be necessary to bury nose in mint.  The mint
is intended for odor rather than taste.
