1 1/4 c  Bread flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
3 tb Rye flour
3 tb Yellow cornmeal
1/3 c  Rolled oats
3 tb Quaker Multi-Grain
2 tb Oat flour
3 tb Wheat Germ(honey crunch)
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Milk or cottage cheese
1 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Honey
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Vital Gluten
1 1/2 ts Yeast
MMMMM-------------------ADD WHEN DOUGH FORMED------------------------
1/4 c  Walnuts(or other); chopped
1/4 c  Sunflower seeds
1 tb Sesame seeds
1 tb Poppy seeds
1/4 c  Carrots;grated(optional)
Add everything (except the seeds and nuts) to breadbaker in the order
appropriate for your machine. I have Panasonic and use VARIETY Cycle
which allows me to take the dough out, work with it, then put it
back(minus the blade-VERY IMPORTANT) to continue to bake. If you
don't have this feature, you can just set it to a dough cycle and
finish baking manually. The important thing with this bread is that
you have to add the seeds and nuts separately because of the large
qty, otherwise they will fly around the machine and make a mess.
**For the Panasonic, on the Variety Cycle, it will beep after about 2
hrs. and 20 min. (and will indicate 1:55 on machine). When it beeps,
take dough out and put on a floured surface. Also TAKE DOUGH BLADE
OUT OF BUCKET. Add the seeds & nuts, carrots too if desired. (Raisins
can also be added as well). Work it into the dough, so it is spread
fairly evenly. Put back in bucket, and press START. *** You can also
roll out dough, place ingredients on top and then roll up the dough,
tucking under the ends.
