Put water in large stock pot and add meat.  Add remaining ingredients.
Bring to boil and if you have it put a diffuser under pot and keep
the heat just below a simmer. This is like a crockpot, but my
crockpot is too small. <g>  Continue cooking for 4 to 8 hours. Remove
meat and allow to cool. Strain Stock and chill if necessary to remove
any fat. After removing fat, return to pot.  Strip meat from bone and
skin. Bring to a boil and add Soup vegetables and pasta to the
strained stock. Reduce to a simmer and cook til vegetables are done.
Add meat and thicken if desired. Serve with fresh rolls or bread.
