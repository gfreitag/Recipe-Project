Title: OLD ENGLISH FRUIT CAKE
Categories: Fruitcake, Dark
Yield: 1 Servings
In this solid dark, old
Fashioned cake, there's just
Enough
Batter to hold the fruits
And nuts together, and to
Absorb
The aroma of the liqueur
That moistens the cloth in
Which it
Ages (I would use Saran
Now)
1 pound butter 1 pound brown sugar 12 eggs separated 4 cups flour 2
teaspoons each cinnamon, mace, cloves (this is what makes it dark) 1
teaspoons each allspice, nutmeg, salt (this too) 1 pound mixed candied
fruit 1 pound candied cherries 1 pound seeded raisins 1 pound seedless
raisins 1 pound currants 1 pound pitted dates, cut in pieces 1/2 pound
diced citron (optional) I would leave this out citron is very strong
tasting and this is what people usually do not like in fruitcake. Use
candied pineapple instead. 1 pound broken walnuts 1 cup rum or brandy
1/2 cup double-strength coffee grated peel and juice of 3 medium
sized oranges grated peel and juice of 1 lemon

Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add well
beaten egg yolks and stir vigorously until smooth and creamy. Sift
flour, measure, and sift with spices. Combine candied fruit,
cherries, seeded raisins, seedless raisins, currants, dates,
pineapple and walnuts, and mix lightly with 1 cup of the spiced
flour. Add remaining flour to batter, blending alternately with
mixture of rum, coffee, and fruit peel and juices. Add fruit and nut
mixture and mix well. Beat egg whites until they hold stiff peaks,
then fold into batter. Butter 4 loaf pans (5 X 9) line with brown
paper and butter again, Spoon in batter. Bake in a very slow oven 250
for 3 hours 30 minutes or until a tooth pick inserted comes out
clean. (I would put a shallow pan filled with water on the bottom
shelf of the oven.)
