Green onions
Coarsely chop the lemon grass and lime leaf. Peel the garlic and
onions and chop. Add these plus the spices and the red pepper to a
food processor. Pour in the coconut milk and blend to a thick paste.
(If you can't find thick coconut milk, use regular but pour off and
save the thin liquid on top and use the thick cream on the bottom of
the can.)

Spread the marinade on both sides of the steaks. It should be like a
crust on the meat. Let stand in the fridge for 3 hours to overnight.
Save the remaining marinade.

Grill the steaks on a hot grill to medium (or as desired). While the
steaks are grilling, stir-fry a selection of veggies in a wok until
tender crisp. Remove veggies and keep warm. Add the saved marinade to
the wok and add the remaining coconut milk or the thin liquid poured
off the top. Simmer until slightly reduced, or if too thick add a
little water or fish sauce. Salt to taste, and return the veggies to
the wok; stir to coat.

Slice the meat across the grain into 1/2" slices. Arrange on top of
hot steamed rice or rice noodles. Top with veggies and sauce. Garnish
with a small dollop of chili paste if desired.

The tumeric gives this dish a wonderful bright yellow color. You can
substitute chicken breasts or pork steaks for the strip loin.
