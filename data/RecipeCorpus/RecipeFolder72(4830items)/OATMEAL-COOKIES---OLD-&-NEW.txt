Here is the original:

Famous Oatmeal Cookies

From "Best Recipes from the backs of boxes, bottles, cans, and jars"
"Quaker Oats first printed this cookie recipe on their oats package
in 1955 but I suspect it was a favorite even before that.

Beat together shortening, sugars, egg, water and vanilla until
creamy. Sift together flour, salt and soda; add to creamed mixture;
blend. Stir in oats. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheets.
Bake in preheated 350 deg.F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Makes 5 dozen
cookies."
