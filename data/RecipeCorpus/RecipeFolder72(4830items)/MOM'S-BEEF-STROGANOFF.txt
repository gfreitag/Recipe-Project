Categories: Meats, Mom
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Beef suet
2 1/2 lb Beef, cubed
MSG (or gunk)
1 1/2 c  Onions, chopped
1 lb Mushrooms, sliced
3/4 c  Sherry, dry
3 tb Cornstarch, rounded, in
1 c  Water, cold
2 c  Sour cream (or use equal
-parts s/c and yogurt)
Over high heat, brown suet (drippings) in pot.  Grease bottom and
sides, take out fat chunks.  Brown cubed beef lightly. Salt and
pepper, add gunk. Stir in onions, mushrooms and sherry. Turn down low
and simmer about 10 minutes.

Soften cornstarch in cold water; add to beef, stirring continuously.
Add water if needed so meat chunks are covered when pushed down. Turn
burner off to start cooling mixture. Add sour cream to top; spread
lightly and let soften.  Stir in; serve on top of hot noodles.

Notes:

*  Brian prefers it on top of rice.

*  Can substitute 2 small cans of mushrooms for fresh.
