Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 12 Triangles
5 oz Lancashire Cheese, Grated
4    Spring onions, trimmed and
-sliced
2 tb Wholegrain Mustard
2 oz Butter
6    Sheets Filo Pastry
1 tb Poppy Seeds
Set oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6. Mix together the grated cheese,
spring onions and wholegrain mustard.

Melt the butter in a small pan.

Lay out a sheet of filo pastry on a clean board, brush with melted
butter and place another sheet on top. Repeat so you have a stack of
3 sheets. Do the same with the other three sheets.

Cut each stack of pastry into 6 strips, about 3 inches wide.

Spoon a little of the filling at the top of each strip, then fold the
pastry over at a triangular angle, to cover the filling.

Continue folding the pastry so you have 12 triangular parcels.

Lift on to a baking sheet and brush the tops with melted butter.
Sprinkle with poppy seeds and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden
and crisp
