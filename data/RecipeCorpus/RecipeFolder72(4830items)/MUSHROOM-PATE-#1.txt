Title: MUSHROOM PATE #1
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 12 Servings
1/3 c  Butter
1/2 c  Fresh mushrooms (any type)
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
2 tb Dry sherry or vermouth
3 oz Cream cheese; softened
1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley
In a fry pan, melt butter over med. heat, add mushrooms and onions.
Cook until mushrooms are browned (10-15 min.), stirring often. Mix in
sherry. Remove from heat,set aside. In a bowl, beat cream cheese and
parsley until blended, and then add mushroom mixture. Blend. (If you
want the pieces of mushroom, just stir. I like to Cuisinart in, so
it's the same consistency as pate.) Refrigerate, and serve with
breads or crackers.
