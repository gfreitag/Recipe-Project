Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 md Onion, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 c  Mushrooms, sliced
3 tb Flour, toasted
1    To 1 1/2 cup water or veg.
Stock
1 tb Shoyu (soy sauce)
1/2 ts Molasses
3/4 ts Savory
1/2    Tst
x  Black pepper & salt to
Taste
Thyme
In a non-stick skillet, stir the flour over medium heat until it
begins to smell toasted and turns very light brown. Pour flour to a
small bowl && set asside.  Reduce heat to medium && steam/saute
onions && garlic, using teaspoons of the water or stock to keep them
from sticking, until the onions are soft. Add mushrooms, cover, and
simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. The mushrooms will release liquid, cook
them until it has mostly evaporated. Sprinkle flour over the mushroom
&& onion mixture and mix. Stir water or stock, shoyu, and molasses
into the mushrooms && onions. Simmer over medium-low heat until the
sauce thickens. Season with herbs, pepper, && salt.  Serve
immediately.

This is nice on baked potatoes, pasta, thick toast, etc. If you mix
in a cup or so of soy milk (not flavored) it makes a lovely soup.
