This came off the board over a year ago, and sorry I don't know who
to give the credit to, but it sure IS worth trying. It's a wonderful
side dish made especially for mushroom lovers!  >>> Saute mushrooms,
onions and clery in butter until just tender.  Remove from heat and
add cooked, crumpled bacon and mayonnaise. In a 9 x 13 glass dish,
put 3 slices of buttered bread, cubed.  Top with the mushroom mixture
and 3 more slices of bread cubes. Pour milk and eggs over all and
refrigerate a few hours. Just before baking, add the mushroom soup
over the casserole, and top with the last 2 slices of buttered, cubed
bread. Bake uncovered at 350~ for 1 hour. Add cheese over the top and
bake 15 minutes longer. FROM: CAROLE ROCK (TSTW72B)
