Title: MUFFIES: THEY'RE THE TOPS

1 ea Muffie tip and hints
Who eats muffin bottoms? Just about everyone prefers the tops. Which
is why I invented "muffies". They're baked on a baking sheet instead
of a muffin tin and have no bottom. The muffie has a lot going for
it: Two cups of muffin batter, which customarily makes 4-6 muffins,
is enough for 16 muffins. And they take much less time to bake,
usually less than 10 minutes. I prefer them just lightly browned so
they stay a little moist and soft inside. Almost any thick muffin
batter will work, but space the muffies at least two inches part
because they spread a good deal, especially if the batter is not
chilled. They way to get a puffier muffie is to refrigerate the batt
until it is very chilled. Bake the batter right after it is mixed and
all you'll get is a flat, soft cookie. Muffies should be enjoyed
warm, right from the oven. To reheat, wrap them in foil and warm
gently in a conventional oven. To store, arrange in a single layer on
a baking sheet and freeze them. Once frozen, place them in an airtight
plastic bag, then in another airtight plastic bag to stave off freezer
odor. Defrost as needed. The following muffies will get you started.
The first two are deliberately low in cholesterol. The
Blueberry-Apple Muffie is not low, but not excessive, either.
