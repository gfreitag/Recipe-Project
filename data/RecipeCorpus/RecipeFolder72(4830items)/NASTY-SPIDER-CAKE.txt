Title: NASTY SPIDER CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
1    Cake mix
1 pk Green jello prepared
Black frosting
8    Licorice sticks
8    Gumdrops
(once made as a tease for a woman who HATED spiders)

Take your average cake mix. Bake it up in 2 metal bowls--1 bigger
than the other. Once unmolded, cut the bigger one (the "body") in
half, horizontally. CAREFULLY scoop out an adequate cavity in each
half. FILL with well-whipped set green Jello, and reattach the
halves. Frost black, arrange on serving platter. Use licorice stix as
legs. Use 2 BIG green gumdrops and 6 little ones as eyes. When the
cake is cut into, it spurts green goop, just like a real spider when
stepped on.

Why not add a red hourglass to the back and make it toxic? ;-)
