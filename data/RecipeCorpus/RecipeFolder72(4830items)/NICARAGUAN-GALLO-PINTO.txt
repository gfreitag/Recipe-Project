Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM-----------------FORMATTED BY LISA CRAWFORD----------------------
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 lg Onions; sliced thin
2 c  Cooked red beans*
1/4 c  Bean cooking liquid or water
1 c  Cooked white rice*
*NOTES: Beans: Place 1 c of dry red beans, 6 mashed garlic cloves and
enough water to cover in a pressure cooker and cook for 15 to 20
minutes. Do not add salt as it will toughen beans. Rice: Converted
rice works best. It can be made in the rice cooker if you prefer, but
watch the water rice ratio and cooking time; the rice needs to be
firm, not sticky.

Heat the oil in a heavy pot and saute onion until lightly golden. Add
the cooked beans and liquid, Stir gently and continuously over low
heat for about 5 minutes; the beans should remain whole not mashed.
Add the cooked rice and continue to stir for about 10 minutes. Taste
and add a little salt if desired.
