Title: OLD FASHIONED BAKED BEANS
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Great northern or small
2 lb Mixed beans - Great
Northerns, white beans
Romans, and random mix.
1 ts Salt (omitted)
1 ts Dry mustard
2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1/2 ts Black pepper from a bottle
1 ds Hot sauce
1 ts (heaping) hot chili
Condiment
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1 1/2 c  Coarse chopped onion
1/4 c  Molasses or honey
1/2 c  (scant) honey
1/4 c  Brown sugar
8 ts White sugar
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
1/2 c  White vinegar
Presoak beans.  Drain.  Combine dry ingredients and mix with beans;
stir in other ingredients.  Pour into 1 1/2 qt. or 2 qt. baking dish
or bean pot. [Obviously, if you double the recipe like I did, you'll
need a bigger pot :-]  Pour in boiling water to cover. Cover. Bake at
300 degrees for 6 hours; add a bit of boiling water if needed.
(Crock-pot method: cook on low 8-10 hours.)

Comments:  I just dumped everything on top of the beans and stirred
them; then covered them with hot tap water. They took a lot longer
than 10 hours to cook, but that might have been due to too-low heat
on the crockpot. (Also, reportedly vinegar and other acid substances
need to be added at the end of cooking else they'll make the beans
tough.)

These beans were *really* good.  The caramelized onions were even
better. I've enjoyed the beans plain, with barbecue sauce, and with
spinach and corn added.
