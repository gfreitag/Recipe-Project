3    Sticks unsalted butter --

Preheat oven to 300oF. Butter a 4 1/2-inch-deep (12-cup) Kugelhupf or
bundt pan and dust with cocoa powder, knocking out excess.

In a bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large
metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt
chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth. Remove chocolate from
heat and stir in rum, coffee, and granulated sugar. With an electric
mixer beat in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, scraping down side, and beat
in eggs and vanilla until batter is combined well. Pour batter into
prepared pan.

Bake cake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 1
hour and 50 minutes. Let cake cool completely in pan on a rack and
turn it out onto rack. Cake may be made 3 days in advance and kept
wrapped well and chilled.

Dust cake with confectioners' sugar and serve with whipped cream.
