Categories: Pastries, Passover, Jewish, Wine
Yield: 8 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
5    Whole matzos
1/2 c  Sweet red wine; kosher for
-Passover
2    Eggs; separated
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Matzo meal
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 c  Strawberry preserves or
Cherry preserves
1/8 c  Nuts; finely chopped (do not
-grind)
1 lg Apple; peeled, cored and
-thinly sliced
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 tb Honey
1 1/2 tb Oil
In a large deep dish, soak the whole matzos in the wine for 5 minutes,
being careful not to break them. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks
and sugar until light and lemon-colored. Stir in the matzo meal.

In a clean small bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until the egg
whites are stiff but not dry.  Fold the egg whites into the egg yolk
mixture.

Combine the preserves and nuts in a small bowl.  Mix well. Arrange the
sliced apples in a shallow dish; sprinkle with the cinnamon. Heat the
honey and oil in a 8 x 8-inch baking pan over low heat. Stir until
blended.

Carefully place 1 matzo in the center of the pan and spread with half
of the egg mixture.  Place the second matzo over the filling and
spread with half of the preserves mixture. Place the third matzo on
top of this and arrange the sliced apples and cinnamon evenly over
the matzo. Cover with the fourth matzo; spread with the remaining
preserves mixture. Top with the fifth matzo.  Stir any leftover wine
into the remaining egg mixture and spread over the top and sides of
the strudel.

Bake in a preheated 325-degree F. oven for 30 minutes or until golden
brown.  Cut into portions while still warm, but leave in the pan to
cool thoroughly.  Serve cold. Serves 8 to 10. Source: The Complete
