Title: OATMEAL MILLET MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/4 c  Boiling water
1 c  Uncooked instant rolled
Oats
1/2 c  Butter at room temperature
(1 stick)
1 c  White sugar
1 c  Brown sugar
2 ts Vanilla
2    Eggs
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Millet
Preheat the oven to 350. Butter 12 muffin cups. Stir the oats into the
boiling water, cover, remove form heat and let stand
20    minutes. Cool. Sift together the flour, baking soda and
salt. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Slowly
add the white and brown sugars, beating until smooth and creamy. Add
the vanilla and the eggs and beat until well blended. Add the cooled
oatmeal to the butter mixture and stir well to blend. Add the flour
mixture and stir. Stir in the millet. Spoon the batter into the
muffin cups, filling about 2/3 full. Bake for about 15 minutes, or
until a straw inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
Gently run a table knife around the edge of each muffin, lift them
out and place on a rack to cool. These muffins freeze well.
