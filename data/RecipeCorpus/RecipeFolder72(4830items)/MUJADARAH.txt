Title: MUJADARAH
Categories: Mediteranea
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Lentils
1/3 c  Rice
2    Onion
3 c  Water
2 ts Mom's Allspice
1 ts Cumin
1/4 c  Oil
Salt and pepper
Quarter and slice onions, and fry in oil until dark brown. Meanwhile,
combine lentils, spices, water, and bring to a boil. Add onions and
rice, and cook until rice is tender.

A variation on this is to substitute egg noodles for the rice, and
toss in some frozen chopped spinach. This makes for more of a "soup",
while the other is meant as a side dish.
