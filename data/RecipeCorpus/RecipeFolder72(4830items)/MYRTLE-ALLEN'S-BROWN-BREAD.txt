Title: MYRTLE ALLEN'S BROWN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
2 c  Warm water (approx)
3 tb Molasses
1 pk Active dry yeast OR 1 tbsp.
3 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Wheat germ
2 ts Salt
1 tb Sesame seeds
Cut 13 x 8-inch piece of parchment paper; make 3-inch slash into
each corner.  Fit into greased 9 x 5-inch loaf pan and trim excess
paper. Set aside.
In small bowl, combine 1 cup of the water with molasses; sprinkle in
yeast.  Let stand for 5 - 10 minutes or until frothy.
In large bowl, combine flour, wheat germ and salt. Using wooden
spoon, beat in yeast mixture and enough of the remaining water to
make sticky dough.  In bowl, work with hands for 30 seconds.
Transfer dough to prepared pan.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cover
with a tea towel and let rise in a warm place for about 20 minutes or
just until dough reaches top of pan. Bake in 400 degrees F. oven for
50 - 60 minutes or until browned and loaf sounds hollow when tapped
on the bottom. Remove from pan and peel off paper. Turn upside down
and return to turned-off oven for 20 minutes.  Let cool completely on
rack. Makes 1 loaf.
