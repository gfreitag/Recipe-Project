Non-Stick buttered flavored cooking spray

In a 1 quart saucepan, combine the apricots and raisins. Add water to
cover. Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes or until the fruit is
soft.

Drain and coarsely chop.  Transfer the fruit to a medium bowl. Stir
in the pears, maple syrup, lemon juice, cinnamon and nutmeg. To keep
dough from drying as you work, unroll it onto a counter and cover
with a berely damp towel.  Peel off 1 sheet of phyllo and place it
flat on a dry section of the counter.  Spray lightly with butter
flavored non-stick spray. Top with a second sheet and brush very
lightly with water. Repeat the process, coating alternate sheet with
either spray or water, until all 8 sheets have been used. Spoon the
pear mixture onto the dough, positioning it along the lower half of
the long side of the rectangle and leaving a 1 inch border on the
sides and bottom. Fold in the sides and coat lightly with the spray.

Starting at the bottom, roll the strudel to enclose the filling. Coat
a cookie sheet with the spray. Transfer the roll, seam side down, to
the sheet. Brush the top lightly with water. Bake at 350 F for 30-35
minutes, or until golden.  Serve warm or cold. To make slicing
easier, use a serrated knife.  Serves 8.
