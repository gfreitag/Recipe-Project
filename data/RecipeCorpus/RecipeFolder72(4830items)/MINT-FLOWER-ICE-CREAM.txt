Mint leaves and flowers
This is the perfect dessert for a summer's day.  Use a combination of
spearmint, apple mint and eau-de-cologne mint for the best flavour.

Dissolve the sugar in the water, then boil for 3-4 minutes to make a
light syrup.  Put in the mint leaves and flowers and liquidize until
smooth.

Cool, then strain.  Add the lemon juice and stir in the cream. Mix
well together, whisking gently.  Add a drop or two of food colouring
if necessary.

Pour into an ice tray and freeze until mushy.  Beat well, then freeze
until hard.

Serve in tall glasses, decorated with sprigs of mint leaves and lots
of fresh mint flowers.
