Title: NUA SAWAN (THAI BEEF JERKY)
Categories: Beef
Yield: 1 Serving
2 1/2 lb Top sirloin or top round
Roast
3 ts Coriander seeds
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 1/2 ts Sugar
4 ts Thai light soy sauce-Aew Sai
1 1/2 c  Oil
Slice beef across the grain 2"X 3" in size and 1/4" thick. Roast
coriander and cumin seeds in a fry pan over low heat until fragrant,
cool, and grind coarsely in a mortar or a spice grinder. Combine beef
and the rest of the ingredients and marinade 1 hour. Place beef
pieces on a cake rack sprayed with Pam and put the rack in a foil
lined cookie sheet large enough to catch any liquid dripping from the
beef. Place the cookie sheet in a lowest setting oven until the beef
pieces are dry to the touch and no liquid seep out when pressed
(between 6-12 hours depending on the oven). Over medium-low heat,
heat the oil in a flat-bottomed fry pan and drop the beef in 5-6
pieces at a time. Fry until crispy on the outside and around the
edges. Drain on a cake rack over paper towels. Keeps up to 1 week in
an airtight container at room temperature. Serve alone or with cooked
sticky rice.

NOTE: Tenderize beef lightly with a mallet if using other cuts of
beef. Be sure to drain the oil well. Any excess may become rancid.
Cool completely before storing.
