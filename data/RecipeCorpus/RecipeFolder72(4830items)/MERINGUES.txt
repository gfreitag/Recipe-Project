Title: MERINGUES
Categories: Desserts, Cookies, Boulleray
Yield: 20 Servings
4 lg Egg whites
1 pn Salt
1 pn Cream of tartar
3/4 c  Confectioners' sugar; sifted
Slowly beat egg whites until bubbly, add salt and continue beating
until foamy. Add cream tartar and beat at high speed, adding sugar
gradually. Butter a sheet of waxed paper and place on cook ie sheet.
Drop meringue by teaspoon, spacing to allow for spreading. Turn oven
to the lowest possible temperature, about 170 degrees. Place cookie
sheet in the center of oven. To prevent the meringues from
over-cooking, slide an empty cookie sheet under the filled one. Bake
for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Remove from paper immediately and cool on
rack. Store in a covered tin. They keep very well.
