baking dished and bake in a 250 degree oven for one hour, stirring
occasionally. Remove from oven, let cool. Store in covered containers.

HELPFUL HINTS: Nuts may be omitted, use more wheat or rye flakes.
Other dried fruits may be substituted for ones suggested. Be sure to
stir every 20 minutes or so to keep the granola from sticking or
burning. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34, Uploaded June
