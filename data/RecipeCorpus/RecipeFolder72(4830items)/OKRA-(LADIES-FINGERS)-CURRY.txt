Title: OKRA (LADIES FINGERS) CURRY
Categories: Vegetables, Indian
Yield: 2 Servings
225 g  Okra (Ladies Fingers)
3 tb Oil
Grated flesh of 1/2 coconut
1/2 ts Chilli powder
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Ground cummin
225 g  Yoghurt
1/2 ts Mustard seeds
1    Red chilli, cut into pieces
1    Sprig coriander leaves
4-6 curry leaves
Salt
Wash the okra and dry them on absorbent kitchen paper. Cut into 2.5cm
lengths.

Heat 1 Tbs oil and fry the okra for about 2 minutes, turning gently,
until all the oil has been absorbed. Remove with a slotted spoon and
set aside.

Blend the coconut with the chilli powder, turmeric and cumin in a
blender, adding 1 Tbs water to make a smooth paste. Mix this into the
yoghurt.

Heat the remaining oil and when hot, add the mustard seeds and red
chilli. Let them sizzle for a few seconds, until all the seeds have
popped, then add the okra.

Turn the heat down and add the yoghurt mix. Cook gently for 2-3
minutes, stirring to prevent the yoghurt from separating, until hot
through. Add the coriander and curry leaves, and salt to taste.
