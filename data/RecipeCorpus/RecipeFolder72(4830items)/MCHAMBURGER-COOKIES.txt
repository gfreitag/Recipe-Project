1    Box vanilla wafers
1 c  Flaked coconut
Green food coloring
1 pk Chocolate coated Keebler --
Grasshopper cookies
1 cn Vanilla frosting
Yellow food coloring
1    Egg white -- beaten
Slightly
2 tb Sesame seeds
Place vanilla wafers on surface, flat side up. In a plastic food bag
knead coconut with just enough green food coloring to tint it the
color of shredded lettuce. Put 1/3 of frosting into small bowl with
just enough water to thin to consistency of buttermilk (pourable).
Add a few drops yellow food coloring to resemble color or American
cheese. Place a dab of frosting on flat side of each vanilla wafer
and then a bit of tinted coconut. Place a Keebler cookie on top of
that with a little bit of frosting and cover with flat sideof another
vanilla wafer, using a little pressure to force some of the frosting
to drip over sides resembling melted cheese. Wipe top of each
assembled cookie in beaten egg white and sprinkle with a few sesame
seeds before egg white can dry. Let stand at room temp until firm or
set and wrap each in paper used to wrap the McDonald's hamburgers in.
Store at room temp, covered, to use in a week or two. Source: Gloria
