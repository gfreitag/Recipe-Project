Title: NEW MEXICO GREEN CHILE RELLENOS
Categories: Southwest, Chile, Cheese
Yield: 12 -16
12    Whole, Long, Green chiles
-Such as Anaheim or Big Jim
1 lb Jack cheese cut in
-thin strips
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking powder
1    Egg
1 c  Milk
Roast and peel the green chile peppers, removing the seeds and
stems. Try to keep the chile flesh whole. Make a slit in the chile
just large enough to insert strips of cheese.

(Some cooks prefer to leave stems on(I am one), so slit down the
side of the chile to remove seeds and to insert cheese.) 	Mix flour,
salt and baking powder. Add molk and egg and beat until smooth. Dip
cheese-stuffed chiles in batter and fry in about 1 inch of hot fat
(veg oil) until they are golden brown. Drain. Ideally, they are
served with hot pinto beans.
