Title: MIKE BOWERS HOMEMADE CHIPOTLES
Categories: Sides
Yield: 1 Servings
Jalapenos
I did some a couple of weeks ago, and it's worked fine. I used a
mixture of peach and hickory; I smoked them for about 8-9 hours then
let the fire go out. I finished them in my dehydrator then next
morning, though I understand that fresh smoked jalapenos are also
good (ie, not smoked to complete dryness, and stored in the freezer).
I've got a second batch that I'll do this weekend using a different
technique (well, red jalapeno's are only $1/lb at the farmer's
market!) suggested in the Chipotle Cookbook (think that's the title).
I've frozen a bag of jalapenos, and will pull them out and smoke them
~ apparently they collapse and carmelize more, giving a somewhat
sweeter, smokey taste. I just do it in a typical small water smoker,
but I've also smoked stuff in a Weber (small fire on one side, pan of
water under grill).  I forget the temperature I used (probably around
160F), but if you're interested email me and I'll look it up. They
suggested that the chiles absorb all the smoke they are going to in
4-6 hours.  I also did some serrano's and Fresno's at the same time.
