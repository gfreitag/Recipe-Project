Title: NUT-STUFFED CABBAGE ROLLS
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
12 lg Cabbage leaves
1 c  Bread crumbs, whole wheat
2 tb Onion; grated
1/2 c  ;water; boiling
1 c  Hazelnuts or pecans
1/2 c  Celery; diced
2 ts Herbs; mixed
Salt and pepper to taste
MMMMM----------------INGREDIENTS FOR DEEP FRYING---------------------
3 oz Flour
8 tb Water
1/2 c  Bread crumbs, dry
Oil for deep frying
Blanch whole cabbage leaves two at a time in enough boiling salted
water to cover for about five minutes.
Drain and cool in a colander.

Meanwhile mix the cup of whole wheat bread crumbs with two
tablespoons grated onion, and add one-half cup of boiling water. Let
stand for five minutes to soften the bread crumbs. Then add the
chopped nuts, the diced celery, the mixed herbs and spices.

With a sharp knife, cut out the hard stem from each cabbage leaf.
Lay the leaf flat on a working surface and spoon the filling onto the
edge of the leaf. Coat the edge evenly, then roll it up tightly. If
the cabbage leaves are small in size, take two leaves and arrange
them so that one edge overlaps the other; line the leading edge with
the filling and roll it up.

In a bowl, combine the flour with 8 teaspoons of warm water. Beat
them together until they form a thickish batter. Dip the cabbage
rolls in the batter, then coat them with breadcrumbs and deep fry.

Serve garnished with sprigs of parsley or mint.

Serves four.
