I'm NOT a coleslaw fan, but this one by Jeff Cox looks promising.

The secret seems to be soaking the cabbage in ice cold water for a
couple of hours.

Remove outer leaves from cabbage, then core.  Cut heads into quarters
and soak in cold water in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Shake
off excess water and shred very finely, then pat shreds dry with
towels. Place the shreds in a bowl and mix in all other ingredients.
Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.

Makes 8 servings.
