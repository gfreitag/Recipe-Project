============== ===
1. Cut meat into 1/8" thick slices 6-7" long. In a heavy plastic food
bag (about 1 quart), combine miso, syrup, sake, ginger, and pork; mix
well. Seal shut and chill for at least 1 hour or up until the next
day.
2. Core apples; cut into 1/2" wedges. Moisten with lemon juice to
preserve color.
3. Thread a thin skewer through the end of a pork slice, then a piece
of onion and a piece of apple. Weave skewer through meat slice again
and repeat process, dividing ingredients among 4-8 skewers. If made
ahead, cover and shill up to 3 hours.
4. Lay skewers on grill 4-6" above a solid bed of medium-coals (you
can hold you hand at grill level for only 4-5 seconds). Baste with
marinade and turn often until meat is no longer pink in center (cut
to test), about 10 minutes.
