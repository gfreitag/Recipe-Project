Title: NAN
Categories: Breads, Indian
Yield: 12 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------BREAD--------------------------------
1/2 tb Yeast
3 c  Flour

1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Butter
3/4 c  Yogurt
1/2 c  Water

4 tb Butter
4 tb Onions, chopped
A flat bread from India.  Make sure your oven is well preheated.

Use dough cycle on machine.  Remove dough from machine and divide
into 12 parts.

Preheat oven to 500.  Roll each part into a small circle (about 8"
diameter) and place on greased pizza or other baking pan. Brush top
of each one with melted butter and press finely chopped onion into
dough. Bake 10-15 minutes until puffy and brown.

Sylvia's notes: Yummmmmmmy!  However, 10 minutes in MY oven turned it
almost black; 5 minutes 30 seconds (at 475, since my oven runs a
little hot) turned the nan golden brown and perfect. Also, I rolled
it too thin at first.  They came out much better when I didn't roll
them paper thin, more like 1/8" thin.  I put spoonsful of
Yogurt-Cucumber Salad on them; this is the best bread I've ever
tasted for eating-food-on. However, as delicious as it is, I doubt
I'll make it often; all the rolling and brushing with butter and
pushing onions in is just too much work.

Donna German's note:  While traditional "Nan" has onions, try
substituting 1-2 ts lemon or orange peel, anise or fennel seeds. Just
sprinkle on top of melted butter.
