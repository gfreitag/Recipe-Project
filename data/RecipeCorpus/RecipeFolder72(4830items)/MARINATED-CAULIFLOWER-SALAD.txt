1. Remove and discard cauliflower leaves. Cut out core and break
cauliflower into bite-sized flowerets.

2. Cook flowerets in a small amount of boiling salted water (or steam
on a rack) just until tender-crisp (5 to 7 minutes). Place in a
colander and rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Drain well.

3. In a small bowl combine vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper. Using a
whisk or fork, gradually beat in oil until well combined. Pour over
cauliflower in a shallow bowl. Cover and refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or
overnight.

4. Just before serving, add radishes, mixing to combine with marinade.
Sprinkle with parsley.
