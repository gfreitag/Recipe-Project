Title: NERO WOLFE'S CAROTTES FLAMANDES
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Carrots
1/4 c  Cold water
8 tb Butter
1/4 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Orange rind, grated
3    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 tb Parsley, chopped
2 tb Sweet butter, melted
Wash and scrape the carrots, cutting them into 1-inch sections and
trimming the ends. Blanch them in boiling water to cover for 5
minutes, drain, and place in a well-buttered casserole. Add the cold
water and butter, and season with salt and sugar. Cover the casserole
and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat and continue to cook
the carrots for 20 minutes or longer until they are tender. Shake the
casserole every 5 minutes or so to prevent the carrots from sticking
to the pan. Five minutes before the carrots are done, add the grated
orange rind and stir. When the carrots are cooked, remove them from
the heat. Mix the egg yolks with the cream, parsley and melted
butter. Add the mixture to the casserole, stirring gently, and put
back over a low flame. When the sauce begins to thicken (do not let
it boil), remove from the heat and serve.
