Title: OKTAPODI MARATHO KRASATO (OCTOPUS & FENNEL IN
Categories: Seafood, Main dish, Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Octopus
1 md Onion; chopped; *OR*
5    (scallions; chopped)
1/3 c  Olive oil
1 c  Dry red wine
1 bn Fennel; chopped
4    Tomatoes (fresh or canned)
- peeled, seeded & chopped
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Beat, pound and rub the octopus from 20 to 30 minutes on a rough stone
surface.  The octopus will feel softer and will secrete a grayish
liquid after pounding. Wash thoroughly, then drain and cook in a
covered pan without adding water until the octopus turns bright
pink-red and feels tender.  Using a sharp knife, cut into rounds the
width of a small finger. Heat the oil in a tsikali or any pot, add
the onion, and cook until translucent and soft.  Add the round
octopus slices to the onion and pour in the wine, and simmer for 15
minutes. Put the fennel and tomatoes on top of the octopus, season
with salt and pepper to taste, and give the pot a good shake to mix.
Cover and simmer until the octopus is fork-tender (approximately 45
to 50 minutes). Serve warm or cold.
