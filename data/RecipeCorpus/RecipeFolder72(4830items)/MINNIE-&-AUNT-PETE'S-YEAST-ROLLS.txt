Title: MINNIE & AUNT PETE'S YEAST ROLLS
Categories: My favorite, Breads
Yield: 36 Servings
6 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
3 ts Salt
2    Egg whites
2 pk Yeast
2 1/4 c  Warm water, 110 degrees
Cut shortening into flour, salt and sugar. Dissolve yeast in warm
water and add to flour mixture, then add egg whites. Mix together,
knead until smooth and elastic (DON'T overknead and add only enough
flour to keep dough from sticking) and let rise 1-1/2 hours, or until
doubled in size.

Punch dough down, roll out on a lightly floured surface, shape into
rolls and place in greased muffin tins . Let rise until doubled in
size and bake in a 375 degree oven 10 to 12 minutes or until brown.

NOTE: these rolls can also be frozen on cookie sheets and placed in
zip-loc freezer bags for up to 4 weeks after they have been shaped
before the second rising. Take out of freezer at least 3 hours before
baking, place in greased tin and let thaw and rise until doubled in
size.

married and then built their houses side-by-side and remained culinary
collaborators, to their family's benefit, all their lives. Deb's
notes: these are an old family favorite and they're quite flexible.
It's pretty hard to mess 'em up. They work as well for breakfast with
jam or honey as they do with with dinner. Sometimes I substitute
whole wheat flour for up to half the bread flour called for.

I've successfully halved the recipe (3 cups bread flour, 1 pkg yeast
or about 1-1/2 ts bulk) in my Hitachi ABM--BUT, BUT, BUT--I _don't_
add the full amount of water at once. Rather, I start out with about
7/8 cup and then dribble enough add'l water into the bread pan during
the early stages of the knead cycle 'til the dough "looks right".
