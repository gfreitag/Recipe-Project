sausages, then the pork, and last the chicken pieces until golden.
Add more fat, if necessary. Transfer to a heavy flameproof casserole
with a lid. In the electric blender combine the chiles, onion,
garlic, tomato, sesame seeds, nuts, and oregano, and blend until
smooth. In the fat remaining in the skillet, cook the puree for 5
minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the stock. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Pour over the meats in the casserole; cover; and
simmer gently, over a low heat, for about 1 hour, or until the
chicken is tender when pierced with a fork.
