FROM:

Cut eight 1-inch slices diagonally from a loaf of day-old French (not
Italian) bread with a serrated knife and reserve the remaining bread
for another use. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet and let them
stand in a warm dry place, turning them several times, for 12 hours,
or until they are completely dry.

In a bowl beat 4 large eggs with 3 Tbsp. sugar and a pinch of salt;
add well combined. Transfer the bread slices to a baking dish just
large enough to hold them in one layer; add the egg mixture, and let
the slices soak, turning them carefully once or twice, for 30 to 45
minutes, or until they are soft and have absorbed most of the liquid.

Heat a large griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot and
brush it with melted unsalted butter. Transfer bread slices with a
slotted spatula to the griddle in batches and cook them, turning them
once and brushing the griddle as necessary with melted unsalted
butter, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they are golden brown and
slightly puffed. Transfer the toast as it is cooked to an oven-proof
platter and keep it warm in a preheated very slow oven (150 F). Spoon
1 Tbsp. orange sauce over each piece of French Toast and transfer
remaining sauce to a heated sauceboat.
