stiff paste. (similar to fondant icing - it must be very stiff) Shape
mixture into 24 small balls. Line a flat non-metallic plate or
turntable with non-stick paper. Arrange meringues, 8 at a time, in a
circle, and cook for 1 1/2 mins. till well risen. Remove meringues
when they have cooled slightly,and repeat cooking procedure with rest
of mixture. The meringues can be kept in a tin indefinitely.
NOTE:Watch meringues carefully and stop cooking if they appear to be
browning at all.
