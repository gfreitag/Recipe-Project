2 ts Onion powder
2 ts Black pepper

2 c  Apple cider vinegar
I make something that I call Memphis in May Dry Rub. It is made with
4 tsp paprika, 2 tps salt, 2 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp Black pepper, 2
tsp white pepper and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. You mix this up in a jar,
closed the lid, and shake well to mix. I then put this in a bottle
and added 2 cups of apple cider vinegar, gave it a good shaking and
BINGO its almost there. A little too hot and I need to cut back a
little on the pepper (at least on the cayenne).  Maybe cut the black
pepper back to 1 1/2 tsp, the White to 1 tsp and>> the cayenne to 1/4
or 1/2 tsp. Like I said this ain't exactly it, but by golly it's damn
close. If you like you may want to add a little garlic powder and/or
some dry mustard. Maybe even a little ground cumin. Just thought I
would pass this along to all you COLD weather cookers and smokers out
there who only get to cookout about half the year. (Yes, Ed, I do
include you, up there in Connecticut, in these numbers.)
