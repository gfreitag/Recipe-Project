1 pk Active dry yeast; or
1 ts Active dry yeast; bulk
3 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Water
3 ts Butter
1 c  Unbleached flour; unsifted
1 c  Cheddar; sharp, grated
1/4 c  Butter
1 ea Egg yolk; lg
1 ts Milk
Place the grated cheese in a small bowl and cover to prevent drying
then set aside.  Combine 1 1/2 cups unsifted flour, yeast, sugar, and
salt in a large mixer bowl, blending thoroughly. Measure 3/4 c of
milk, water, and butter into a saucepan and heat until the liquids
are warm, 115 to 120 degrees F.. Gradually add the liquids to the dry
ingredients in the mixer bowl, beating for 2 minutes at medium speed
of the electric mixer, scraping the bowl occasionally. Add and beat
in 1 cup of unsifted flour at high speed. Beat for 2 minutes,
scraping the bowl occasionally. Mix in enough additional flour (1/2
to 1 cup unsifted) to make a soft dough. (Dough will be slightly
sticky.) Put the dough into a greased deep bowl. Cover with waxed
paper and a clean towel and let stand in a warm place until the dough
has doubled, 45 to 60 minutes. Generously grease several baking
sheets. Melt the butter and set aside. Punch the dough down wit a
fist and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide
the dough into two equal portions.  Set one portion aside. Roll the
dough into a rectangle 16 X 8-inches.  Brush with about one-half of
the melted butter. Sprinkle with about one half of the grated cheddar
cheese. Cut crosswise into 8 equal portions. Cut into halves
lengthwise. Fold each strip into thirds, lapping each side portion
over the center third. Place the rolls on a baking sheet. Repeat for
the other half of the dough. Beat the egg yolk with the tbls of milk,
slightly.  Brush the tops of the rolls with the egg yolk mixture. Let
rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 425 degrees F. for
about 8 minutes or until rolls are golden brown. Serve rolls hot.
