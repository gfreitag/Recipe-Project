Rather at the opposite end of the spectrum from crisp raw vegetables
lies another kind of dipper.  One that at least began life in the
vegetable kingdom ~-miniature potato pancakes. They're delicious and
practical since they can be made weeks in advance and reheated.
Place the potato in a strainer and run under cold water to remove the
starch.  Shake well.  Place in a food processor or blender and chop
fine. Add the eggs salt, pepper, and onion, blending well. In a
10-inch skillet, heat vegetable oil until it crackles.  Drop the
batter by Tablespoonful into the hot oil and fry until golden brown
(about 5 minutes per side). Drain on paper towels.
Once cooled, the pancakes may be frozen.  Place in a freezer-safe
container making sure that they don't overlap and put a double
thickness of wax paper between each layer. Reheat on a cookie sheet
at 350 degrees F. until hot and crisp.
Makes about 50 pancakes or enough for about 2 cups of dip.
