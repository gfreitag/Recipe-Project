From "Cookies for Christmas," by Maria Robbins (St. Martin's Press,
1993, $6.95 paperback).

Heat oven to 350'F. In a large bowl, mix together the oats, flour,
sugar, baking soda and salt. Melt the butter in a small, heavy
saucepan over very low heat. In a small bowl beat the egg together
with the heavy cream and vanilla extract. Stir in currants if using.
Stir in melted butter. Stir the liquid ingredients into the oat-flour
mixture and combine well. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto prepared cookie
sheets, leaving at least 3" between each cookie. These will thin and
spread out.

Bake 5-6 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from oven and cool on
cookie sheets for several minutes, until cookies hold their shape.
With a spatula, carefully remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
Store in an airtight container. Makes about 4 dozen.
