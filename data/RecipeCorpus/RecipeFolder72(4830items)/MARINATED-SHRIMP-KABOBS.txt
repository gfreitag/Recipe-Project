Title: MARINATED SHRIMP KABOBS
Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
Yield: 1 Servings
Shrimp
8 oz Pace Picante Sauce
8 oz Bottled Italian dressing
Cook peeled and deveined shrimp in boiling water just 'til they turn
pink (watch closely - overcooking makes shrimp tough characters).
Drain and place in a bowl. Pour Pace and Italian dressing over hot
shrimp, mixing well. Cover and chill at least 2 or up to 24 hours,
stirring occasionally. In another bowl, chill crisp-tender cooked
broccoli florets and uncooked cherry tomatoes in equal parts of Pace
Picante Sauce and Italian dressing, stirring occasionally. Just
before serving, drain and arrange shrimp, broccoli florets and
tomatoes on short, thin skewers or long cocktail picks. Arrange on a
lettuce-lined platter to serve.
