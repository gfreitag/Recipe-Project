crumbled meringues ahead of time, but assemble the trifle no longer
than 4 hours before serving.

MERINGUES: In bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar until soft
peaks form;gradually beat in sugar until stiff peaks form. Beat in
vanilla. Onto a foil-lined baking sheet, spoon mixture into 2 inch
rounds. Bake in 250 F oven for 2 hours.  Let cool; break each round
into 3-4 pieces. Set aside. In bowl, whip cream; gradually beat in
sugar. Fold in orange liqueur. In top of double boiler over hot, not
boiling, water, or in microwaveable dish, melt chocolate with butter;
let cool slightly. Cut bananas into 1/2 inch thick slices.

Spoon one third of the whipped cream into 8-10 cup serving bowl.
Cover with 1/3 of the meringue pieces; drizzle with 1/3 of the
chocolate. Cover with half of the bananas. Repeat with whipped cream,
meringues, chocolate and bananas. Top with remaining whipped cream,
then meringues, then chocolate. Refrigerate until serving. Makes 8-10
servings.
