Almost like relish or pickle.  Nice as a smaller serving with a rice
salad. Keeps "several weeks" in a jar in the refrigerator. This is
1/4 original recipe which I made for the second time. Have not kept
it longer than a few days myself.

Combine cabbage, onion and pimento in a large bowl. Combine dressing
ingredients except oil in a small saucepan (or glass measure for
microwave).  Bring to a boil, stir, add oil and boil again.

Pour dressing over cabbage and toss.  Cover and refrigerate at least
24 hours to blend flavours, stirring occasionally.
