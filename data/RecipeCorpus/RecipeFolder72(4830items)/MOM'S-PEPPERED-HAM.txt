Title: MOM'S PEPPERED HAM
Categories: Meats, Mom
Yield: 1 Ham
Ham shank
Peppercorns, whole
Water
Place raw ham shank in big pot of water.  Heat to boiling, reduce and
simmer until done, about one hour (consult cooking chart per weight).
Cool. De-skin, remove fat and bone. In the process, you will cut off
some of the lesser-quality meat; will have 2-4 chunks of meat.

(Save scraps and strain fat off top of water; the meat and pot liquor
is great for cooking black beans.)

Put whole peppercorns and water in blender; grind until pureed, till
you have about 1/4 cup.  Coat all sides of the ham chunks (not ends).
Put in 300 - 325 degree oven to dry. Chill and slice as thinly as
possible.
