Title: NITER KEBBEH (SPICED CLARIFIED BUTTER)
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Chopped onions
2    Cloves garlic, pressed
2 ts Fresh gingerroot, grated
1/2 ts Turmeric
4    Cardamom seeds, crushed
1    Cinnamon stick
2    Cloves
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground fenugreek seeds
1 tb Fresh basil
- or 1 teaspoon dried basil
In a small saucepan, gradually melt the butter and bring it to
bubbling. When the top is covered with foam, add the other
ingredients and reduce the heat to a simmer. Gently simmer,
uncovered, on low heat. After about 45 to 60 minutes, when the
surface becomes transparent and the milk solids are on the bottom,
pour the liquid through a cheesecloth into a heat resistant
container.  Discard the spices and solids.

Covered tightly and stored in the refrigerator, Niter Kebbeh will
keep for up to 2 months.

Comment from the book:  Niter Kebbeh has been prized in Ethiopia as a
cooking oil and a seasoning for a very long time. Without careful
packaging and proper refrigeration, butter easily spoils.
Furthermore, because of the milk solids it contains, butter has a low
scorching temperature, which limits its usefulness in cooking.
However, the milk solids can be removed from butter by the process of
clarifying it. Clarified butter keeps well, even at room temperature.
Niter Kebbeh adds flavor to North African foods and is a must in
Ethiopian cooking.
