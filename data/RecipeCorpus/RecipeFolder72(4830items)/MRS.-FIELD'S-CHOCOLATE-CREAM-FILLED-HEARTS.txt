Cream the butter in a medium bowl with electric mixer set at medium

the vanilla and mix until creamy. Scrape bowl. Add flour and mix at
low speed until thoroughly mixed. Gather dough into 2 balls and
flatten to disks. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap or place in an
airtight plastic bag. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm. Preheat
oven to 325~ F. Using a floured rolling pin, roll dough on floured
board to 1/4" thickness. Cut out 2" hearts with cookie cutters.
Continue using dough scraps, rerolling and recutting until all dough
is used. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Place the cookies on
an ungreased cookie sheet, 1/2" apart. Bake 16-18 minutes or until
firm. Transfer to cool, flat surface.

PREPARE CHOCOLATE FILLING: Scald the cream in a small saucepan and
remove from heat. Stir in the chocolate chips and cover for 15
minutes. Stir chocolate cream until smooth, then transfer to a small
bowl. Set filling aside and let it cool to room temperature. Spread 1
teaspoonful of chocolate filling on the bottom side of half of the
cookies. Top with bottom side of another cookie, forming sandwich.
Repeat with remaining cookies and cream. If you wish, sift
confectioners' sugar over the finished cookies.
