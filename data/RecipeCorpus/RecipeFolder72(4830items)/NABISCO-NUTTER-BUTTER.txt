Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
COOKIES
1/2 c  Vegetable shortening
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
1    Egg
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Peanut butter
1/2 c  Old-fashioned Quaker oats
1 c  All-purpose flour
FILLING
1/2 c  Peanut butter
3/4 c  Powdered sugar
1 tb Fine graham cracker crumbs
1.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. 2.  In a large bowl, cream
together the shortening and sugar with an electric mixer. 3. Add the
egg, salt, and peanut butter and beat until well blended. 4. Put the
oats in a blender and blend on medium speed until they are almost as
finely ground as flour. 5. Add the oats and flour to the mixture and
blend well.6. Pinch out small portions of dough and roll into 1-inch
balls in the palm of your hand. Press these flat on ungreased cookie
sheets so that they form 2-inch circles.  If you're a stickler for a
cookie that looks just like the original, you can form the dough into
flat peanut shapes. 7. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until light brown
around the edges. 8. While the cookies bake, combine the filling
ingredients in a small bowl. 9. When the cookies are cool, use a
butter knife to spread a thin layer of filling on the flat side of a
cookie and press another on top. Repeat. Makes 2 dozen cookies.
