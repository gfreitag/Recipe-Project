Title: MIKE'S LASAGNE
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Main dish
Yield: 12 Servings
1 ea Large red onion, chopped
1 lb Lean ground beef
1 lb Sweet Italian sausage
4 ea Garlic cloves, pressed
24 oz Tomato sauce
6 oz Tomato paste
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1/2 c  Water
1 ts Oregano, dried
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 lb Low fat ricotta cheese
1 lb Mozzarella cheese, thinly
-sliced by machine
1 c  Shredded parmesan cheese
16 ea Extra wide lasagna noodles
Get two large frying pans. Spray with the non-stick PAM or similiar.
Place the beef in one, the sausage in the other. As the meat starts
to change colour, add 1/2 the onion and garlic to each pan. Saute
till meat is brown and crumbly in both pans.  They will never get
done at the same time. When brown, put all into one "Really Big"
frying pan, dutch oven or whatever. Add the tomato sauce and paste,
wine, water, oregano, pepper and a bit of salt if you are a salt
lover. Stir, cover and cook for a couple of hours.

Cook the lasagana noodles cooking as per package directions. After
they are cooked, rinse a couple of times with cold water to cool them
hot puppies down. Grab a deep (2-3 inch) 9 X 13 in casserole dish or
pan. Criss cross a layer of noodles for the first layer, followed by
about 1/3 of the sauce, then 1/3 of the ricotta and then 1/3 of the
mozzarella. Do the pasta, sauce, ricotta and mozzarella 2 more times
till gone. Spread the parmesan over the top.  Cook in a pre-heated
350^ oven for
60    minutes.

One of my favorites, as well as mom's.  Freezes well and is great on
a cold winter night when you want something warm and hearty but don't
feel like cooking. Serve with hot sour dough garlic french bread and
a tossed green salad.
