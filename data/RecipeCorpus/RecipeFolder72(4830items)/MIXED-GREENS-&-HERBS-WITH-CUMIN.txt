Title: MIXED GREENS & HERBS WITH CUMIN
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
12 c  Mixed greens; such as
- Mustard, Arugula,
- Watercress, Dandelion,
- Kale, Spinach, Chard,
- Escarole or others
4 lg Garlic cloves
Salt
2 lg Handfuls Italian parsley
-(leaves), chopped finely
1    Handfuls cilantro leaves,
- (or more), chopped finely
3 tb Fruity olive oil
2 ts Paprika
2 ts Ground cumin
1    Lemon; cut in wedges
MAKE A MIXTURE OF GREENS TO SUIT your taste. Cut away the stems and
stalks and wash the leaves. Set the greens in a steamer, with the
tougher greens on the bottom. Cover and steam until tender, about 10
minutes. Or, cook each type of green separately in boiling, salted
water, until done. Let cool a few minutes in a colander, then squeeze
out the extra liquid and chop roughly. Pound the garlic and 1/2
teaspoon salt together in a mortar until finely broken down, then add
the parsley and cilantro and continue working until you have a rough
paste. Or, combine the garlic, salt and herbs in a food processor and
work until everything is fine. You may need to add a little olive
oil. Warm the olive oil with the paprika and cumin. When it begins to
smell good, add the herb paste and mix the 2 together. Next add the
greens and cook everything together for a minute or so until any
excess moisture has evaporated. Taste and season with salt, if
necessary. Pile into a serving dish and garnish with the wedges of
lemon.
