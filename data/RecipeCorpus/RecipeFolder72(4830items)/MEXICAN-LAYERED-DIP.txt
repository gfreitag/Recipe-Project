Title: MEXICAN LAYERED DIP
Categories: Digest, August, Lacto
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Bag baked tortilla chips
1 cn Ff refried beans(15oz?)
1/2 pk Old El Paso taco seasoning
1/2 c  Your favorite salsa
8 oz Ff cream cheese
2 c  Shredded lettuce
1 c  Ff fancy shredded cheddar
Cheese
3/4 c  Chopped green onion
1 c  Chopped tomato
Mix together the refried beans and taco seasoning and spread in the
bottom of 2 small or 1 large shallow serving dishes. In a food
processor, blender or with a hand mixer combine the salsa and cream
cheese (it will be runny). Pour over the beans and layer the other
ingredients in order ending with the tomatoes. Refrigerate for at
least 1 hour before serving. Serve with baked tortilla chips - my
favorite brand is Tostitos. I sometimes garnish by edging the dish
with chips.
