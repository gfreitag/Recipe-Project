Title: MUFFULETTA FROM NEW ORLEANS
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Loaf Italian Bread, round
Ham
Salami
Provolone Cheese
Mozzarella Cheese
Olive Salad
Slice the loaf of Italian bread in two and warm in an oven until
toasty. Place the cheeses on one half and the meats on the other.
Thickness and quantity of cheese and meat can vary with each
individual, but one layer of each ingredient is standard.  Cover the
half that has the meat on it with olive salad.  Put the two halves
together and cut in quarters.

There are three crucial elements to making a good muffaletta:

1.  Fresh, quality ingredients 2. Good olive salad. The Central
Grocery in New Orleans, which probably makes the definitive New
Orleans Muffaletta, now sells their olive salad by the jar. It's
available in groceries across New Orleans, but I don't know if it is
distributed past here. 3. Warming the bread *before* making the
sandwich. Many people put everything together on the bread and shove
the whole thing in the oven. This is wrong. When you remove the
sandwich, the cheese and the olive salad are way too hot. If you heat
the bread before making the sandwich, the cheese will melt on the
warm bread, the meat will warm up, and the olive salad will stay
around room temperature.

Enjoy!
