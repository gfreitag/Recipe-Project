MMMMM---------------------CHICKENLESS GRAVY--------------------------
2 c  Boiling water
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Nutritional yeast
1    Vegetable bouillon cube
1/2 c  Diced fresh mushrooms
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
Onion salt; to taste
Unbleached all-purpose flour
Steam the spinach and drain well.

Heat the oil or water in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Cook
the onion, stirring occasionally, until transparent, about 5 minutes.

Dissolve the imitation chicken-flavored powder or bouillon powder in
the boiling water.  Add the TVP and let stand for about 10 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pat the tofu dry, then mash.  In a large bowl, combine the TVP
mixture, spinach and tofu.  Stir in the remaining ingredients and
pour the mixture into a lightly greased 8-1/2 x 4-1/2-inch loaf pan.
Smooth the top and bake for 45 minutes, or until brown on top.

If the loaf begins to get too brown on top, cover with aluminum foil.
Make the gravy.  In a large suacpan, simmer all the ingredients
except the flour for approximately 5 minutes. Slowly add the flour
(tablespoon by tablespoon), whisking after each addition, until
desired thickness is reached.  Keep warm.

Let loaf stand for 10 mintues, then run a knife around the edges and
turn out onto a platter.  Serve with gravy.
