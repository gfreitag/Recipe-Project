The main ingredient in this dish in monk fish, which has a taste and
texture similar to lobster. Served in scallop shells or ramekins, it
makes a delectable fish course during a multiple-course dinner.

Cut fish fillets in half lengthwise, then cut each section into 3/4
inch slices. In a large saucepan, place beer, water, onion, celery,
salt, and thyme. Heat to boiling. Add fish, cover, and simmer 4
minutes, or until fish flakes. Remove fish with a slotted spoon.
Drain well on paper towels. Boil stock
10    minutes to reduce. Strain.

In another saucepan, melt the butter. Stir in flour. Add 3/4 cup
strained stock and the cream. Cook, stirring frequently, until
thickened. Add a little hot mixture to egg yolk and return to pan.
Cook slowly, stirring, for 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and adjust
seasonings.

Gently combine fish and sauce. Spoon into scallop shells or individual
ramekins. Sprinkle with cheese. Broil 2 minutes or just until tops are
lightly browned. Makes 6 appetizer servings. From the files of Al
