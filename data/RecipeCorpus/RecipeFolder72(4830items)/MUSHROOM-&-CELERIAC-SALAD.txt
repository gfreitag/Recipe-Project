Title: MUSHROOM & CELERIAC SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Button mushrooms
1/2    Lemon; juiced
100 g  Celeriac
Various lettuce leaves
Watercress, washed
1    Garlic clove; crushed
2 tb Thick Greek yogurt
1 tb Dijon or mild mustard
tb Finely chopped summer herbs
Salt and pepper to taste
When celeriac is unobtainable, you can use finely sliced celery heart
for this delicious salad. The mixture is flavoured with garlic, mild
mustard and summer herbs, and is lovely served with warm granary
bread.

Slice or quarter the mushrooms and sprinkle lemon juice over them.
Peel the celeriac and cut into matchstick-sized pieces or shred in the
food-processor. Drop immediately into water to which you have added a
squeeze of lemon or spoonful of vinegar to stop it discolouring while
you quickly prepare the rest of the salad.

Arrange the salad leaves on two plates. Add the crushed garlic to the
yogurt. Stir in the mustard, salt and pepper. Drain the celeriac and
stir into the dressing. Add the mushrooms and the chopped herbs and
mix well. Pile the mixture on to the salad leaves and serve as soon
as possible.
