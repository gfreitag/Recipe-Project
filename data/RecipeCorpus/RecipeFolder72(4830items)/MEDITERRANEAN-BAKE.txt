Title: MEDITERRANEAN BAKE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Aubergine
Salt and Pepper
2 tb Olive Oil
12 oz Courgettes, Wiped and Sliced
1    Red Pepper, Deseeded and
-sliced
1    Green Pepper, Deseeded and
-sliced
14 oz Can Chopped Tomatoes
1 tb Fresh Chopped Thyme
1    Egg
8 oz Greek-style natural yogurt
4 oz Cheshire Cheese
Trim and slice the aubergine, arrange in a colander and sprinkle with
salt. Leave over a bowl to drain for about thirty minutes; this
removes the bitterness from the aubegine.

Rinse under cold water and pat dry.

Set the oven to 180C,350F, Gas Mark 4.

Heat the oil in a large pan and fry all the prepared vegetables for 5
minutes, tossing frequently. Stir in the canned tomatoes and chopped
thyme. Season to taste then spoon into a 3 pint oven-proof shallow
dish.

Beat together the egg and yogurt then stir in the cheese, spread over
the vegetables and bake for 50 to 55 minutes until vegetables are
tender and topping is golden brown.
