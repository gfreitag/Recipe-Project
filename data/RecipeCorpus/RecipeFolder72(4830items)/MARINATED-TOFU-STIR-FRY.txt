Title: MARINATED TOFU STIR FRY
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
None
My daughter makes a wonderful marinated marinaded stir fry. She
marinades the Mari-Nu low fat tofu and veggies in soy sauce, garlic
and onions. You can cook the marinade for a few minutes to get the
flavors of the garlic and onions.  Just pour over pieces of tofu and
any veggies you may have on hand or like.

Cook the veggies first, add in some of the marinade (I steam them in
the microwave).  I put everything in a non stick frying pan ( I think
my daughter does this as well). When cooked, we serve it over brown
basmati rice.
