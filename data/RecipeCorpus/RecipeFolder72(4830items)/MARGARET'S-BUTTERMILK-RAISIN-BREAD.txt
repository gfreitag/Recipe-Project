Title: MARGARET'S BUTTERMILK RAISIN BREAD
Categories: Abm, Breads, Dairy
Yield: 1 Loaf
3 tb Dry buttermilk powder
7/8 c  Water
1    Egg
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
1/4 ts Baking soda
2/3 c  Raisins
1 1/2 ts Yeast
Place all ingredients in bread pan, select Light Crust setting, and
press Start.

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

This bread earns rave reviews from all tasters!  It's very moist and
tender, and is delicious toasted.  Our friend Margaret loved it at
first taste.  In fact, shortly after that she purchased a bread
machine. It *really* is that good.  (Note:  For the rapid-baking
1-pound Welbilt machine, reduce the butter to 1 1/2 tablespoons and
the raisins to 1/3 cup.)

This is a delicious buttermilk loaf!  I like to put the raisins in at
the "beep" so they don't get smushed up.
