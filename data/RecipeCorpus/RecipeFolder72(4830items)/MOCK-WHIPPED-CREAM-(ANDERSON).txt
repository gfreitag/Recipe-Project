Title: MOCK WHIPPED CREAM (ANDERSON)
Categories: Low-fat, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 ts Unflavored gelatin
1 tb Cold water
1/2 c  Nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 c  Ice water
2 tb Confectioner's sugar*
1 ts Vanilla or other flavoring
A fluffy, all-purpose topping that can double as a filling. Properly
whipped, it will be stiff enough to mound or pipe through a pastry
bag. (My note:  may also be frozen by spoonfuls or in shapes on waxed
paper either plain or with small pieces of fruit mixed in. Also try
with powdered sugar substitute or chocolate powder.)

Soften the gelatin in the cold water in a small heatproof measuring
cup. Set the cup in a pan of simmering water and heat about 4 minutes
until the gelatin dissolves; remove from heat.  (or microwave for
about 10 seconds)

Combine the dry milk, ice water, and confectioner's sugar in the
chilled small bowl of an electric mixer, then beat with chilled
beaters at medium speed until foamy. With the motor running,
carefully pour the gelatin down the side of the bowl so that it
doesn't hit the beaters and spatter all over.

Continue beating at medium speed for 7 to 10 minutes until it is the
texture of whipped cream, then beat in the vanilla. If not used
immediately, store in the refrigerator or freeze in desired shapes.
The mixture deflates on standing and may be rebeaten. Allow 1/2 cup
frozen topping to thaw about 15 minutes before serving.

Makes 3 cups
