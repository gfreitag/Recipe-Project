3 ts Baking powder
6 oz Lard
6 oz Margarine
8 oz Golden syrup

Remarks: This recipe can be found in many very old books, and may
have come form the Old Norse language, where a heap of corn was known
as Mugi. The word can be traced back through early English, where
corn was refered to as Muge and later Muga. In it's ealiest form, it
was probably made with yeast and honey instead of baking powder and
syrup/sugar.
