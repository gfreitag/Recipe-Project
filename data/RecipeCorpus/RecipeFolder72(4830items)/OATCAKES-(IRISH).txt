Title: OATCAKES (IRISH)
Categories: Irish, Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
6 oz Oatmeal (preferably fine)
2 oz Flour
1 ts Salt
10 fl Warm water
Mix flour and salt together.  Slowly add warm water. Roll out on a
floured board to 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into triangles. Cook on a pan
or griddle until golden on both sides. Dry out in a cool oven (150 C
/ 300 F) until crisp.  -- These cakes are eaten buttered, with a
glass of milk, for supper, but are also good with oily fish such as
herring or mackerel. (They are also terrific with wine and cheese.)
