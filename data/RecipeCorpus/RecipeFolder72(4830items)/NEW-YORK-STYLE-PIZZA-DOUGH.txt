Title: NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Active dry yeast
3 c  Bread flour
1/2 ts Salt
Recipe by: Evelyne Slomon - The Pizza Book 1. Pour the water into a
medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in
the yeast.  Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved.
2. Add 1 cup of flour and the salt. Mix thoroughly with a wooden
spoon.  Add a second cup of flour and mix well. After the second
cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough will start coming away
from the sides of the bowl and should begin to form a soft,
sticky mass.  It is now ready to be kneaded. 3. Measure out the
third cup of flour.  Sprinkle some over the work
surface and flour your hands generously.  Remove all of the dough
from the bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the
additional flour in a bit at a time. 4. Knead the dough until it no
longer feels sticky. Continue
kneading only until the dough is smooth and elastic and no lines of
raw white flour show.  The whole process should take 5 to 10
minutes. 5. Lightly oil a 2-quart bowl with vegetable oil. Roll the
ball of
dough around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil. Tightly
seal the bowl with plastic wrap.  Place the bowl in a warm
draft-free
place. 6. When the dough has doubled in bulk (45 to 60 minutes),
punch it
down, knead it for 2 to 3 minutes.  Then return it to the bowl
and refrigerate for 15 minutes before shaping. 7. The dough should
never be rolled out with a rolling pin. This
crushes the edges and affects the final texture. The stretching
method is the only suitable way to shape the dough.
