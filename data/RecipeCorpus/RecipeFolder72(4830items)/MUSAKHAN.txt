Title: MUSAKHAN
Categories: Main dish, Chicken, Middle east
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Frying chicken, quartered
1 1/2 tb Sumac
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Sea salt to taste
1    Lemon, juice only
1 lb Red onions, peeled and
-thinly sliced
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Rich chicken stock
1/2 lb Lavash bread, torn into
-small pieces
1/4 c  Toasted pine (pignoli) nuts
1. Rinse the chicken and pat dry.  Trim off excess fat. 2. Combine the
sumac, spices, and salt.  Set aside 2 teaspoons and mix the rest with
the lemon juice.  Rub into the chicken flesh and marinate up to 2
days. 3. Place the onions in a large skillet, toss with 1 1/2
tablespoons of the olive oil, half the chicken stock, reserved
spices, and a pinch of salt. Cover and cook gently 30 minutes. (Up to
this point the dish can be prepared 1 day in advance.) 4. Bring the
chicken to room temperature and preheat the oven to 400*F. 5. Place
the chicken, skin down, on a non-stick baking sheet.  Divide the
onions in 4 parts and spread them over the chicken; cover with foil
and bake 20 minutes. 6. Lightly brush a large ovenproof serving dish
with the remaining oil. Scatter the torn bread in one or two layers
on the bottom, sprinkle with the remaining chicken stock and
carefully flip the chicken-and-onion quarters onto the bread so that
the skin side is up. Return to the oven and bake 20minutes, until
tender and crispy brown.  Serve at once with a sprinkling of the pine
nuts.
