Clean the clams by scrubbing them thoroughly with a wire brush,
removing any beard or barnacles. Then place them in a large pot with
1 gallon of water or enough to cover, and 1/3 cup salt. Allow the
clams to remain for 20 minutes during which time they will expel the
sand inside. Continue this process, changing the water at least two
more times. The mussels are cleaned in a similar manner, but you must
leave them in the water for at least 2 hours. Throw away any clams or
mussels that float or are not tightly closed. Heat the olive oil in
the bottom of a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the
onion, tomatoes, garlic, coriander, salt, peppers, and saffron and
cook, stirring, until the onions have softened, but are not brown.
Add the fish and shellfish to the onion mixture. Cover with water and
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, or
until the shellfish open. Discard any clams or mussels that do not
open. Serve hot.
