Title: NO-COOK PEANUT BUTTER BALLS
Categories: Candies, Kids
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Peanut butter
1 c  Light corn syrup
1 1/2 c  Dry powdered milk
1 1/2 c  Sifted confectioners sugar
1 lg Bowl and a wooden spoon
Paper plates and pencils
Help the children measure the peanut butter, corn syrup, dry powdered
milk, and confectioners sugar into the large bowl. They can take
turns stirring with the wooden spoon until everything is mixed and a
stiff dough forms.

Give everyone a paper plate and a pencil. Each child should write his
or her name on the bottom of the plate. Make sure they hold their
pencils correctly and use uppercase and lower case letters.

Put a portion of dough on each plate. The children can shape it into
bite-sized balls by pinching off pieces and rolling them between their
hands.

Smaller children who cannot make balls can make snakes. Then they can
cut the snakes into segments (with an adults help) to make bite-sized
pieces.

Leave the peanut butter balls on the children's plates and
refrigerate them until firm, about 1 hour.
