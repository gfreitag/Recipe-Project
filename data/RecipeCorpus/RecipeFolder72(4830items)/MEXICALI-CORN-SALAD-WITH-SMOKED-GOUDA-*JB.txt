Best to use super-sweet fresh corn (not as good with frozen), and
don't omit the smoked cheese, it really makes a difference!

1.  Cut corn kernels off the cob.  Add vegetables to corn.

2.  Cut cheese into small cubes (smaller than 1/2 inch).  Add cheese
and almonds to vegetables.

3.  In a separate bowl or jar, combine the dressing ingredients.

4.  Pour dressing over vegetables and toss until well coated.  Serve.

Note:  If planning to serve at a picnic, etc., add the almonds and
dressing just prior to serving.
