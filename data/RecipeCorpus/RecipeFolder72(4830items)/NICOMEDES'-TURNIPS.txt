Title: NICOMEDES' TURNIPS
Categories: Pickles
Yield: 8 Servings
1 md Turnip
Salt
Poppy seed
1 tb Olive oil
1) Trim and peel the turnip, then slice it into thin pieces which
are shaped like anchovy filets. Drop the pieces into rapidly boiling
water and boil for 3-5 minutes, until they are tender but not too
soft. Drain.

2) Arrange the turnip pieces neatly on a plate. Pour the oil over
them, making sure all the surfaces of the turnips are covered.

3) Salt the turnips liberally, then sprinkle on the poppy seeds
carefully, covering all the exposed surfaces, but keeping the poppy
seeds on the "anchovies" only.
