Title: MR. FOOD'S WASHINGTON'S CHERRY TARTS
Categories: Desserts, Tarts
Yield: 12 Servings
16 oz Dark sweet pitted cherries,
- drained and chopped,
- juice reserved
12    Individual-serving graham
- cracker tart shells
15 lg Marshmallows
1/4 ts Almond extract
2 c  Frozen whipped topping,
- thawed (about 1/2 of
- an 8-ounce container)
======================================================= ====== Place
the reserved cherry juice in a measuring cup and add water to make 1
cup. In a small saucepan, heat the mixture over medium heat until hot
but not boiling. Add the marshmallows and stir until dissolved.
Transfer the mixture to a medium-sized heat-pr NOTE: I like to top
each tart with a dollop of whipped topping and a maraschino cherry
just before serving.
