2 tb Minced jalapenos
4    Cloves garlic
4 c  Vegetable stock
3 tb Tomato paste
-Crushed corn chips for
-garnish
Soak beans in cold water to cover 8 hours or overnight. drain.

Combine crumbled tempeh, wine, soy, cumin, basil, chili; let marinate
for 2 hours at least.

Meanwhile, in a 6 qt. pan over medium high heat, saute onions in
sherry and oil 10 minutes, stirring. Add mushroom and cook 10 more
minutes.

Add tomatoes, green pepper, carrot, celery, chili, jalapenos, garlic.
Saute stirring 5 minutes.

Add beans, stock, tomato paste. Bring to boil, cover, lower heat,
simmer 2 to 3 hours till beans are tender.

Add tempeh and marinade. cook 10 minutes. Serve garnished with chips.

NOTES: This is a midwestern chili (beans and tomatoes!). I added some
leftover crushed tomatoes, and we garnished it with non-fat sour
cream and chopped cilantro (better for you than corn chips). A more
traditional chili style would be to relplace all tomatos with a red
chili sauce: split and de-seed dry red anchos, anahiems, and/or
gujanailos (sp?) and sear on a hot cast iron skillet. put in a bowl
and cover by boiling water. let soak 20 min, then puree, maybe with a
little garlic (and usually salt, but not for this recipe!). Use that
instead of tomato paste and crushed tomato.

Enjoy, Keith
