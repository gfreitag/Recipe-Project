Make vegetable stock by boiling at least one carrot, several bay
leaves, and any leftover root vegetables for 45 mins in 6 cups of
water. Add the black-eyed peas and simmer about 30 mins. Chop the
onion, celery, and the bell pepper.  Remove all the celery leaves
from the top of the bunch, rinse well, and chop them too. Saute the
onion in a little oil. Add the celery, with leaves, and after a few
mins., the bell pepper. Sprinkle generous amounts of the spices in
the pan, and saute another minute. Remove the carrot, vegetable
pieces, and the bay leaves from the stock. Add the onion mixture and
chopped tomatoes to the stock, and stir well, adding more water if
necessary. Let simmer about 10 mins. Chop the okra and stir in with
the frozen corn; simmer another 10 mins. Adjust the spices to taste,
and serve, ideally with cornbread.
