Title: NAME GAME HERB GARDEN (KH)
Categories: Spices
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Aluminum sheet cake pan
5 lb Bag potting soil
Seeds of your favorite herbs
(chives are best for this)
Water
Newspaper
Instead of planting herbs in a flower pot, try sowing the seeds in an
aluminum sheet cake pan (approx. 13x9x2) with special drainage holes
punched in the bottom. Simply fill the tray with potting soil and then
trace your name with your finger on the surface of the soil. Make the
letters large, 4" to 6". Now plant your seeds along the traced row
you made with your finger. Gently push the seeds into the soil and
place in a warm dry spot, a window sill is perfect. Water daily (be
sure to place old newspaper under the tray to absorb the water
running off). Soon tiny sprouts will be peaking up through the soil
in the shape of your name. When the herbs are 3" to 5" tall, you're
ready to present the whole tray at your next party, so that your
guests may help themselves to fresh herbs, in your honor.
