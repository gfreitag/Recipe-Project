6    Boneless, skinless chicken

=======================================================
============== ==== == In a soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat.
Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper and saut√©' for 5 to 6
minutes, until browned. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 3 to
minutes, or until the onion is tender. Add the remaining ingredients
and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 50 to 60
minutes, or until the chili thickens slightly, stirring occasionally.
NOTE: For a really hearty meal, I like to serve this chili in a big
bowl over hot cooked rice.
