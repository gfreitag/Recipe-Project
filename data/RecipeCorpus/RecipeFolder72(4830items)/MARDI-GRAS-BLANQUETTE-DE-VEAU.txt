Categories: Veal, Creole
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Breast of veal
1    Onion; quartered
1 ts Salt
Pepper; to taste
1    Carrot
Bay leaf; and
Parsley sprig; OR
Bouquet garni
2 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
2    Egg yolks
1 c  Cream
Cut the veal into cubes, pour boiling salted water over it, and let
soak for 20 minutes.  Drain the veal and put in a pan; cover with
water. Add the onion, salt, pepper, carrot (cut into quarters), bay
leaf and parsley. Bring to a boil and simmer slowly for about one
hour, or until the veal is tender.  When the meat is done, make a
white sauce with the butter, flour and meat stock from the veal. Cook
for twenty minutes and add the egg yolks mixed with the cream. Pour
over the meat and serve in a casserole.

VARIATION:  This may be served with small white onions. Put the
onions, cooked until tender, in the casserole with the veal and pour
the sauce over all. Mushrooms, cooked seperately, may be used in the
same way with the veal.
