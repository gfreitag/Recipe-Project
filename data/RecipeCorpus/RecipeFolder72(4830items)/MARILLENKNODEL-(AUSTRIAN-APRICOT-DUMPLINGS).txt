Title: MARILLENKNODEL (AUSTRIAN APRICOT DUMPLINGS)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 kg Potatoes
1/2 ts Salt
300 g  Flour
1 kg Fresh apricots
sm Cubes of sugar
100 g  Plain bread crumbs
1 sm Pat of butter
50 g  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Boil potatoes in their jackets and then peel.  Mash potatoes in a
large bowl, mixing in salt and flour to make a potato dough.

Wash apricots and remove pits.  Place a small cube of sugar where the
pit should be.

With your hands, form a pattie of dough not much more than a cm. thick
which can encircle the apricot. Place the apricot inside the dough and
seal.

Have a large pot of boiling, slightly salted water ready. When all the
dumplings are formed, place them into the boiling water and cook for
10 minutes, stirring as needed.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat and then stir
in breadcrumbs.  Allow to brown slightly for two minutes, then add
sugar and cinnamon and stir. Turn heat to very low and keep warm
until dumplings are ready.

When dumplings are cooked, remove from water and roll in pan of
breadcrumbs. Serve warm. (Be careful, the fruit can be very hot!)

[**note: you can also substitute the Pfanni potatoe dumpling mixture
for the potatoe dough, if you can find this in your grocery
store...that's how I remember my Mom usually making these]--
