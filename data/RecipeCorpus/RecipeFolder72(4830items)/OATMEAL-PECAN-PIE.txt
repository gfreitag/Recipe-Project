Roll out the Rummed Oat Crust dough on a lightly floured board, and
line a 9-inch pie plate with it. Trim and flute the edges.

Preheat the oven to 400F.

Place the oats in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Cook,
stirring constantly, until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Allow to
cool.

Lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl.  Beat in the honey, both
sugars, pepper, butter, cream and vanilla. Stir in the oats and the
pecan pieces. Pour into the pie shell and bake 10 minutes. Reduce the
heat to 325F and continue to bake until the filling is firm, about 30
minutes longer. Serve warm.  Serves 8.

Crust:  Combine oats, flour sugar and salt. Cut chilled shortening
into dry ingredients. Mix in the egg yolk with a fork, and add enough
rum to form a soft dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour
before using. Makes one 9 crust
