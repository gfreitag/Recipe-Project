3 lb Pork, cut in
-bite sized pieces
10    Roasted peeled and seeded

-(add more if you want the
-chile less hot-depends on
-the chiles)
Boil posole about 2 hours, until it pops.  (You also may use dry
posole which will require longer cooking). Add pork, onions and
garlic. Booil until the meat is cooked, about 1 hour, on medium heat.
Add chiles and tomatoes, and season with salt to taste. The tomatoes
"cut" the hotness of the chiles, and give it a tangy flavor.

Chicken also makes a good posole and is often used in place of pork.
