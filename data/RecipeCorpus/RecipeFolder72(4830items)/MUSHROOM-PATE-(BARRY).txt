Title: MUSHROOM PATE (BARRY)
Categories: Barry
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Button Mushrooms, trimmed
4 oz Open Mushrooms, trimmed
2 tb Olive Oil
2    Cloves Garlic, Peeled and
-chopped
1/2 ts Powdered Bay Leaf
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Salt
2 oz Butter
1    Egg
Wash the mushrooms in a colander of 30 seconds to a minute, using
very hot water, but don't peel them. Cut into half-inch pieces.

Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the mushrooms and garlic and
fry over a medium heat until the mushrooms give off liquid. Turn up
the heat to maximum and boil away the liquid until the mushrooms are
almost dry.

Put them into a food processor or liquidiser if you have one, with the
powdered bay leaf, paprika and salt. If you don't have a processor,
put the mushrooms through a mincer.

Add the butter to the frying pan and scramble the egg in it to take
up all the remaining liquid and bits of mushroom. When the egg has
set, put it into the food processor with the mushrooms and herbs and
puree until the mixture is fine-grained.

If you have minced the mushrooms, put them into a bowl and beat the
scrambled eggs into them very well - you may find a fork best for
this - until the mushrooms and egg are well blended together.

Pack the mixture into individual ramekins or a single souffle dish if
you prefer, and chill for at least five hours before using. Serve
with warm crusty french bread - what else!!

If you wan't to keep the pate for a few days, seal the top with a thin
layer of melted butter and keep in the fridge covered with foil or
cling film for up to three days.
