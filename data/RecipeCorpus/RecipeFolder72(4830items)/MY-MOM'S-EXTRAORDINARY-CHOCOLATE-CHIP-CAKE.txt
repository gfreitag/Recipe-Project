Title: MY MOM'S EXTRAORDINARY CHOCOLATE CHIP CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  All-Purpose Flour --
Unbleached
2 c  Light Brown Sugar -- packed
1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
1    Stick Unsalted Butter -- cut
In 6 pieces
1 lg Egg
1 ts Baking Soda
1 c  Sour Cream
2 tb Milk
9 oz Semisweet Chocolate Chips
Optional
1. Position oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325
degrees F.  Butter a 11x7x1 3/4-inch baking pan or ovenproof glass
baking dish.

2. Put the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl and mix
with an electric mixer on low speed for 15 seconds. Add the butter
and mix till the butter pieces are the size of peas. You will still
see loose flour. Mix in the egg.  The mixture will still look dry.
Rub any lumps out of the baking soda and gently mix the baking soda
into the sour cream. Stir the sour cream mixture and the milk into
the batter.  Stir just until the batter is evenly moistened.  Stir in
the chocolate chips. The batter will be thick.

3.  Spread the batter in the prepared baking pan. Bake about 40
minutes. To test for doneness, gently press your fingers on the top
of the cake. The middle should feel slightly soft and the edges firm.
A toothpick in the center should have a few crumbs clinging to it.
Cool on a wire baking rack, the center of the cake will sink slightly.

Notes:  My metal cake pan is the size specified, like a small lasagna
pan. The cake took 47 minutes to bake.

The 2 Tb. milk is optional, I find the cake is better with it.

This cake is good dusted with powdered sugar and is also good served
with vanilla ice cream.
