"For those who cannot or prefer not to eat refined sugar, this
delicious recipe uses natural fructose which may be found in grocery
stores or health food stores. One tester experimented with her ricpe
by substituting Sugar Twin for the fructose.  She recommends using 1
Tbl. - 1 1/2 Tbl. or 2 Tbl. for a regular loaf and doubling that
amount for a sweeter loaf."
