Title: MOLASSES BROWN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 1/2 c  Wheat germ
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Raisins; mixed dark & light
2 ts Baking soda
1 7/8 c  Buttermilk
1/3 c  Molasses
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Grease a 9 X 5 X 3-inch pan. Combine
flour, wheat germ, brown sugar, salt and raisins in a mixing bowl.
Mix well. In a second mixing bowl, mix baking soda, buttermilk and
molasses, using a wooden spoon.  This misture will start to bubble.
Immediately mix it into the dry ingredients. Spoon the batter into
the greased pan. Bake at once. The bread is done when a toothpick
comes out clean, about 1 hour. Turn out of the pan and cool on a wire
rack. Makes 1 loaf.
