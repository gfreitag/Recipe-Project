2 c  Apple cider vinegar
3 c  Dark brown sugar
1 1/2 tb Kosher salt

together until onions begin to become translucent, about 15 minutes.
Prepare 8 half-pint jars, lids and rings according to manufacturer's
instructions. Spoon the relish into the jars, filling to 1/2 inch
from rim. Clean the rims and seal according to manufacturer's
instructions. Process sealed jars in boiling water for 10 minutes.
