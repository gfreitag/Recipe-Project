Triticale is a nutritious grain that is a hybrid of wheat and rye.
You can find it in most health food stores. It adds to the taste but
not much to the rising of bread. In combination with wheat flour, it
makes good bread for sandwiches or toast, with a pleasant but
unobtrusive flavor.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.
