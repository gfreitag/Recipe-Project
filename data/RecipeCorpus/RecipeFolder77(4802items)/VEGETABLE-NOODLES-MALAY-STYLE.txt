A wonderful medley of interesting vegetables, some egg noodles, and
oriental flavours of black bean, sesame, garlic and chilli. This is
blissful food at any time of the year.

Steam the vegetables until tender and set aside. Cook the egg noodles
for 4-5 minutes in boiling, salted water, stirring occasionally.
Drain. Heat the oil and quickly stir-fry the garlic, chilli and
spring onions. Stir in the black-bean sauce. Add the noodles to the
pan and toss in the mixture, then add all the vegetables and the
chives, and stir-fry until they are heated through and tender, but
still slightly crisp. Serve at once, garnished with coriander leaves.
