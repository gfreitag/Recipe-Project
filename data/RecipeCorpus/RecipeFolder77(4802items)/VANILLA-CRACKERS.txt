Title: VANILLA CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 70 Servings
3 c  All-purpose flour or pastry
Flour
8 tb (1 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/2 pt (1 cup) heavy (whipping)
Cream
3 tb Honey
1 ts Vanilla extract
"These irresistible Vanilla Crackers are flaky and delicate. They are
a rich, but not heavy, conclusion to a light lunch. Or try dunking
them like donuts in coffee or hot chocolate. 300~F. 15 to 20 minutes
Preheat the oven to 300~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, cut the butter into the
flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

In a separate bowl, mix the cream, honey, and vanilla extract. Add
this liquid mixture slowly to the flour mixture and blend to form a
dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. You may have to add
a little extra cream or some milk.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll to 1/8 inch thick. With a sharp knife,
cut into 1-1/2-inch squares. Place them on a lightly greased or
parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turning
over once. Do not allow the crackers to become darker than light
brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 60-70.

VARIATION: If you have access to soft drink syrups, try substituting
root beer syrup for the vanilla extract.
