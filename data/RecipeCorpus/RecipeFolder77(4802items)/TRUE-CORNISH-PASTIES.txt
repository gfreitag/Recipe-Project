Categories: Pies, Lamb/mutton, Beef
Yield: 12 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
3/4 c  Butter, unsalted; cold
6 tb Shortening; chilled
3 c  Flour, bread
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  ;Water, ice (about)
MMMMM------------------------MEAT FILLING-----------------------------
3    Lamb kidneys
1/2 lb Steak, fat free
2 md Potato
1 md Onion
1 lg Carrot
1    Garlic clove
2 tb Parsley; chopped (opt)
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Pepper, black
1 lg Egg; beaten
Cut fat into the flour with a pastry blender or 2 knives or an
electric mixer until the mixture is blended and forms lumps the size
of peas. Rub mixture between your fingers until you have a fine
grained texture. Add just enough ice water to make it stick together
and quickly knead it into a smooth and shiny ball. Speed is
important. Cover and refrigerate for 60 minutes before rolling out.
Halve the kidneys and remove film and fatty core.  Dice the kidneys
and steak very fine. Peel and chop the vegetables equally as fine.
Mix well in a bowl with parsley and spices. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F.  Roll out the unsweetened pastry to a thickness of 1/8
inch and cut into 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Put a spoonful
of the meat mixture in the center of the rounds. Paint the edges
lightly with water.  Cover with the remaining rounds, pinching the
edges together very firmly.  Prick well with a fork.  Place on a
baking sheet and paint with the egg.  Bake 30 minutes.
