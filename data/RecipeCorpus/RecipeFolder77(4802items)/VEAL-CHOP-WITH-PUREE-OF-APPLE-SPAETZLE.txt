wine, lemon juice, shallots, and garlic, down until the apples are
soft. Remove from the heat and puree until smooth.  Bring a pot of
salted water to boil, reduce heat, and maintain a simmer. In a bowl,
stir the apple puree, eggs, flour, 1 teaspoon of aslt and baking
powder together. Place in a colander over the pan, and press through
the holes into the hot water using a rubber spatula. When the
spaetzle floats to the surface, cover and cook the spaetzle until it
swells and is fluffy. Remove from water and shock with ice water.
Drain the spaetzle and set aside. For the veal chops: In a saute pan,
heat the olive oil.  When the pan is smoking hot , sear each chop for
2-3 minutes on each side. Season each chop with Essence. Remove from
pan and allow to cool. Cover each chop with the mustard and crust
with the chopped herbs.  Place the chops in the oven and cook for
about 15 minutes. or until mediu-rare. In a sauce pan, heat the veal
reduction and grilled apples together.  Bring up to a simmer and
season. In a saute pan, melt the butter.  Add the spaetzle and saute
for 3-4 minutes. Stir in the parsley and season.  Spoon the sauce
over the platter. Mound the spaetzle in the center of the sauce.
Place the chops on top of the spaetzle with their bones crossing.
