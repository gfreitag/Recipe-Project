Title: WHITE ROSE TOILET SOAP
Categories: Household, Herb/spices
Yield: 1 Batch
1 lb Hydrogenated vegetable oil
.  or lard
2 oz Coconut oil
4 oz Commercial lye; dissolved
.  in cold water
1 oz Baking soda
1 tb Salt
1 oz Glycerine
3 dr Essential oil of rose
Place the water, lye and grease into a large kettle on a medium
flame. Stir continuously with a large wooden spoon.

The water will evaporate as the mixture thickens. The mixture will
thicken and spit up like gravy, indicating that sponification has
taken place.

Remove the mixture from the stove, stir it to help it cool evenly. It
is important to stir the hot soap while it is heating to prevent it
from scorching on the bottom of the pan.

Add the remaining ingredients, except for the perfume. Add color if
desired.

Add perfume. Pour into molds.

NOTE:  Saturated fats usually give a better performance in soap
making, which is why lard and tallow were once used exclusively in
this process. Hydrogenated vegetable oils, however, which are solid
at room temperature, can be excellent substitutes for lard or tallow
and are generally preferred by vegetarians. Liquid vegetable oils can
be used, but you might need to reheat several times to get a hard
soap. Unless you like the smell of peanuts, avoid using peanut oil.
