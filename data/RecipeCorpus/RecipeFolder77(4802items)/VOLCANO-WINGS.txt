12 oz Bottle Red Devil Cayenne
-Pepper Sauce*
1 ea Stick butter
Melt butter in sauce pan, stir in Red devil sauce, let simmer over low
heat. Pour approx. 4 oz. Fry Magic in gallon size zipper bag. Dip
chicken pieces in water and shake in bag, coat well. Fry chicken
pieces in 1/4" oil, 5 minutes per side. (Electric skillet at 350
works great.) Remove chicken pieces from skillet and drain on paper
towel. Dip chicken pieces in sauce mixture, place on serving platter
until "dry" looking, dip pieces in sauce again and place back in
skillet to cook another 10-15 minutes per side. Remove chicken from
skillet and place on paper towel to drain. Dip once again in sauce
and serve.

*may substitute like brands.

This method of preparing the wings was devised after about 2 months of
testing different methods each Sunday during football season. The
recipe calls for 2-3 lbs. of wings, but if your friends and family
are anything like mine, you'll need to double it, and maybe more!
(Especially for those playoff weekends). The reason we use a coating
mix is that after the initial frying time, the coating really absorbs
the hot sauce (this is what all the other recipes I've run across
lack). Then the final frying finishes cooking the chicken and seals
up the hot sauce coating. Dipping the pieces before serving provides
the final texture and flavor.
