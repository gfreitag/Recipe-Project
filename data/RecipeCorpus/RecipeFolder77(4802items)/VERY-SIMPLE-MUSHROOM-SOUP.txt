Given that morel season is here, I thought I would post a recipe for
wild mushroom soup. This might work with regular mushrooms but I've
only made them with fresh wild ones. Boletes aka the Porcini to be
exact. If you can get them, they make a simply sublime soup. This
recipe is from Joe's Book of Mushroom Cookery.

Clean mushrooms well. Barely cover with water in a saucepan. Turn the
heat on and cover the pot with a tight fitting lid. When the water
comes to a boil, turn it down to a simmer for 10 minutes. The
mushrooms will have given off their liquid and literally made their
own soup. For every 2 cups of liquid, add 1 tsp each of salt and
sugar and 1 tbl soy sauce. Add 4-5 scallions, sliced thin and 1/3 cup
shoestring potatoes. The soup is finished when the potatoes are
cooked.
