Toss scallions, thyme, savory, parsley, garlic, chives, salt, pepper

Soften the (sun- or oven-) dried tomatoes by covering them with
boiling water and letting sit for 2 minutes. Drain, slice thinly
crosswise, and set aside.

Cook tortellini in a large pot of boiling water until they rise to the
surface. Drain and toss with half of the herb mixture. Keep warm.

Slice the squash thinly crosswise. In a nonstick skillet, heat the
other half of the herb mixture over medium heat and cook the tomatoes
and squash for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the broth and
simmer over low heat for 2 minutes. Toss the vegetables with the
pasta and serve immediately.

Garnish with fresh nasturtium flowers and leaves (well cleaned).
