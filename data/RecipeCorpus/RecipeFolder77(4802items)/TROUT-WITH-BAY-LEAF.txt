Title: TROUT WITH BAY LEAF
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Rainbow trout
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 cl Garlic
1 ts Dried thyme
6    Bay leaves
12    Slices of bacon
2 tb Salad oil
1/4 c  Melted bytter
Juice of 2 lemons
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
Preheat oven to hot (400).
Sprinkle the trout inside and outside with salt and pepper. Crush the
garlic and thyme together to make a paste. Put some of the paste in
each fish.  Place one bay leaf in the interior of each fish. Neatly
wrap the fish in bacon, using 2 slices for each fish.
Oil a baking dish large enough to hold all the trout and arrange
them in it. Sprinkle with melted butter and bake for 10 to 15
minutes, or until bacon and fish are done. Baste the fish as they
cook.
Transfer the fish to a warm serving platter and sprinkle with lemon
juice and parsley.  Serve, if desired, with buttered boiled potatoes
sprinkled with parsley. The New York Times Menu Cook Book, by Criag
