[Note:  serving size is the number of peices this recipe will yield,
not the number of people it will serve.]

1. Combine filling ingredients together in a small bowl.

2. Heat oven to 350 degrees.

3. If necessary, roll out puff pastery slightly to be able to cut 12
3-inch circles from each sheet using a cookie cutter or the rim of a
glass.

4. Place 1 T of filling on half of a puff pastry circle. Brush entire
edge of circle with egg mixture. Fold pastry over yo form half-moon
and grimp edges clsed with a fork. Repeat with ther rest of the
circles.

5. Brush pstreis with remaining egg wash. Bake until golden brown,
about 10 minutes.

[Another Note:  I assume the ground turkey is "Cooked Turkey" ground
up, not the hamburger like stuff you get in the stores.]

This is another one of those recipes from the Chicago Tribune Magazine

menu for a cocktail party for 100 hosted by a business executive
thanking her clients at her home in Chicago.
