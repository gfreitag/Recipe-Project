and mix again.

Butter a pan abt. 2 inches smaller than the phyllo sheets. Use a
little more than hale of the phyllo sheets to make th b9ottom layer
of the pie. Brush each with melted butter and place it in the pan
letting the edges hang over the pan.  Pour in the cheese-egg mixture,
spreating evenly. Cover mixture with the phyllo that extended beyond

remaining phyllo to fit pan. Brush each sheet with butter before
