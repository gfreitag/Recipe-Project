WARNING: Hottest sauce in North America. Use this to enhance dull and
boring food. Keep away from pets, open flames, unsupervised children,
and bad advice. This is not a toy. This is serious. Stand up
straight, sit right, and stop mumbling. Be careful not to rub your
nose, eyes, or mouth while working with habaneros. You may actually
want to wear rubber gloves while chopping and mixing -- these babies
are powerful.

Mix all the ingredients together and stand back. This will keep,
covered and refrigerated, until the year
2018. Be careful though: If it spills, it will eat a hole in your
refrigerator. If you ever want to dispose of it, call the local toxic
waste specialists.

NOTES : This style of hot sauce, widely used in the West Indies, is
basically habanero peppers (also known as Scotch Bonnets), fruit, and
yellow mustard, with a few other ingredients thrown in. Use this
recipe as a guideline. Habaneros are at the top of the chile pepper
heat scale, so feel free to substitute other peppers of your choice.

Funnel the sauce into an old pint liquor bottle, then let your
imagination run free as to what whopper you can lay on your guests
regarding its origins. If you're having trouble, here's a start: "One
day in Jamaica I was in this dingy bar and met this old guy who..."
and you take it from there.
