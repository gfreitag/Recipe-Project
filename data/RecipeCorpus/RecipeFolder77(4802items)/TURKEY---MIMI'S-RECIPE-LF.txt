Season the outside with salt, pepper and paprika, then into the pan
breast side DOWN.  Combine 2 cups apple juice or cider with 1/2 cup
soy sauce and pour that in the pan. Into the oven, then start basting
it after 1 hour. Baste every 20-30 min.  When a thermometer inserted
into the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165F, remove from oven
and tent with foil for at least 30 min.  (If the liquid runs out,
make up more baste. You want to have plenty for the gravy.)

And I have the perfect turkey, that even looks like the perfect
turkey, first time, every time.

And beyond that, you should taste the gravy that this basting sauce
makes.

NOTE: I used apple juice to baste. This makes the most incredible
gravy!!! And cooking it breast side down makes for the juiciest
turkey breast you have ever tasted.
