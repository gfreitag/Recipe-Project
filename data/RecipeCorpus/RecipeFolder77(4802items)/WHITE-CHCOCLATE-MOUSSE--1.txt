Title: WHITE CHCOCLATE MOUSSE -1
Categories: Chocolate, Mousses
Yield: 1 Servings
10 oz White Chcoclate -- broken in
20    Pcs
4 tb Water
2 c  Heavy Cream
Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over low
heat. When the water is hot (do not allow to simmer), place white
chocolate and 4 tablespoons of water in the top half of the double
boiler. Using a rubber spatula, constantly stir the white chocolate
and water until melted, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
keep at room temperature until needed.

Place the heavy cream in a well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with a well-chilled balloon whip. Mix on high until stiff,
about 1 minute. Remove the bowl from the mixer.  Using a hand-held
whisk, vigorously whisk 1/3 of the whipped cream into the melted
white chocolate. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula, and
continue to whisk until smooth and thoroughly combined.  Add the
combined whipped cream and white chocolate to the remaining whipped
cream and use a rubber spatula to fold together until smooth.

Transfer to a container and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before
serving.
