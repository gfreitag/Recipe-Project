Title: TRIPLE-H SPARE RIBS
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
SEE DIRECTIONS:
Like most good dishes, it is easy to fix.  Buy the ribs "two and
under," which your butcher will know means slabs of ribs two pounds
or less in weight. Sprinkle them with Dry Rib Seasoning, taking care
to get plenty of seasoning under the flap of meat on the bottom, or
bone side, of each slab. Mop thoroughly and cook on the barbecue
grill.
