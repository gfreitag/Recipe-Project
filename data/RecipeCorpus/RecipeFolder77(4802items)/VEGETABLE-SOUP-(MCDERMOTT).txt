Categories: None

2    Russet potatoes cut into 1

1    Tomato and 1/2 cup canned
Tomatoes or 1-1 1/2 cup
Canned tomatoes
1    Onion, cut into chunks
1    Carrot (or two), thinly
Sliced
2    Stalks celery, cut into
1    Inch pieces
1 bn Spinach, remove stems and
Wash
1    2 cups cauliflower, cut into
Florettes
6    Cloves garlic (diced or
Whole)
3    Bay leaves
2 ts Or so herbs: sage, marjoram,
Basil, thyme, oregano
1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/4 c  Tamari/soy sauce
5    7 cups water
In a large pot place onion, carrot, celery, spices, garlic, soy sauce,
garlic powder, bay leaves and water. Bring to a boil and cook 15
minutes. Add tomato, mushrooms and green beans and cook for 15 more
minutes. Add potatoes and more water if needed. In 15 more minutes
add the cauliflower and zucchini. Adjust seasonings and add salt to
taste (or more soy sauce). When everything is cooked, remove from
heat. Add spinach, making sure to submurse it in order to wilt the
leaves. Serve.

Amounts of vegetables are aproximate, as are cooking times. The soup
needs to cook around 1 hour or 1 hour 15 minutes, so gauge when to
add vegetables by how little you want them to be cooked (or
overcooked). This is a hearty but light soup, so chunk vegetables in
large pieces.
