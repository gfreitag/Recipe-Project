In 1918, Walker Austex was producing 45,000 cans of Walker's Red Hot
Chile Con Carne (with beans) and 15,000 cans of Mexene Chili Powder a
day in their new factory in Austin, Texas. But Walker had already
been selling canned Mexican foods for over a quarter century and may
have been the first to can chili. Gebhardt's didn't start canning
chili (as opposed to making chili powder) until 1911. Walker's 1918
recipe booklet had recipes for "chile huevos" and "chili mac" ~- plus
something called "combination chili con carne" -- one can chili mixed
with one can tomatoes.

Genuine Mexican Chile Con Carne. One pound of beef cut in small
pieces; 1/4 lb. beef suet, ground fine (or you can use lard). Add two
tablespoons of Walker's Mexene, one medium sized onion minced; add
water and boil until thoroughly cooked. The gravy from this chili con
carne is fine for macaroni, spaghetti and vegetables. If beans are
wanted, use any good red bean. For instance -- California Bayous,
California Pinks or Pinto Beans. When these are not convenient, use
French Red Kidney Beans. Boil the beans separately and add beans when
serving.
