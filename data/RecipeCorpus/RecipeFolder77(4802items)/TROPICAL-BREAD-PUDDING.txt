Title: TROPICAL BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
6 oz French bread, sliced 1/2"
Thick
3    Medium bananas, sliced
1/2 c  Flaked or shredded coconut
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
4    Eggs
1/3 c  Packed brown sugar
1 1/2 c  Half-and-half
1 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
Powdered sugar
Banana slices
Arrange half the bread in the bottom of a greased 9-inch square
baking pan. In a bowl, toss the bananas, coconut, and lemon juice;
distribute evenly over the bread layer, and top with the remaining
bread. In a bowl, beat the eggs and brown sugar.  Beat in the
half-and-half, milk, and vanilla to blend thoroughly. Pour over the
bread, and press the bread down slightly to saturate it completely.
Bake in a 400F oven until the bread is browned and the custard is
set, 45-55 minutes. Cool slightly. Dust with powdered sugar, and
garnish with additional banana slices. Serve warm. Top with whipped
cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired.
