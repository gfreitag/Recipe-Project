Categories: Dessert, Pudding, Typed
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Canned pumpkin
2 1/4 c  Whipping cream
1 ea Vanilla bean, split in half
7 ea Egg yolks
1 c  Granulated sugar; divided
1 ts Ground cinnamon

Caprial Pence, co-owner and chef at Westmoreland Bistro, included the
recipe for this special holiday dessert in her latest cookbook,
"Caprial's Cafe". This will be a nice change from pumpkin pie for
Christmas.

In a heavy saucepan over medium temperature, heat the pumpkin puree,
cream and vanilla bean halves to a boil and set aside.

Place the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium stainless
steel bowl (or the top of a double boiler) and place the bowl over a
pot of barely simmering water. Whisk constantly until the mixture
forms a ribbon when you lift the whisk, about 6 or 8 minutes. Be
careful not to scramble the egg mixture.

Slowly whisk in hot pumpkin mixture to the egg mixture and stirring
frequently, cook over medium heat until the mixture has the
consistency of softly whipped cream, 40 to 50 minutes. Add the
cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ginger and mix well. Pour into 6
custard cups and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.

When ready to serve, sprinkle each custard with 4 teaspoons sugar and
place under a preheated broiler for 2 or 3 minutes or until sugar is
browned. Serve immediately.

Makes 6 servings
