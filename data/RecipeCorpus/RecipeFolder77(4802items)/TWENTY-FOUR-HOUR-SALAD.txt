Title: TWENTY-FOUR HOUR SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Head romaine lettuce
1    Head iceberg lettuce
10 oz Frozen peas, rinsed
-until just thawed
2 md Sweetish onions, chopped
1    Green pepper, chopped
1 c  Celery, chopped
1 1/2 c  Mild cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1 c  Or 2 Hellmann's real
-mayonnaise
1 c  Or 2 sour cream
2 tb Or 3 sugar
More parmesan cheese
Wash the lettuce.  Break into pieces, line the bottom of a [large]
bowl. Add layers of peas, onion, green pepper, celery, cheddar, more
lettuce, another layer of everything, top with lettuce. Sprinkle
parmesan cheese over the top.

Combine equal amounts of mayonnaise and sour cream, add sugar, mix
well. Spread over the top of the salad. Sprinkle more parmesan on top.

Cover and chill 12-24 hours.

Some people say to toss before serving; this makes for soggy
leftovers if you don't eat it all.  I suggest dishing out portions at
a time and tossing the portion separately (keep the rest in layers
with the dressing on top, it will be good for a couple of days).
