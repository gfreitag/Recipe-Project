Title: WHOLE WHEAT & OAK BRAN BREAD
Categories: Quick bread
Yield: 20 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS (BNVX05A)
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Oil
1 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Molasses
1 1/3 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Flour
3/4 c  Oat bran flakes
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
2 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Dates; chopped
1 c  Walnuts; chopped
Beat together first 5 ingredients until blended. Mix together the
remaining ingredients and add all at once. Beat until blended. Do not
overbeat.
Divide batter between 5 greased mini-loaf pans (6x3x2-inches) and
bake in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes, or until a cake
tester, inserted in center, comes out clean.  Allow to cool in pan
for 10 minutes, and then remove from pans and continue cooling on a
rack. Yields: 5 mini-loaves.

Note:  Oat bran can be purchased in most supermarkets or health food
stores.  It comes as "milled" or "stone-ground". The milled is finer
in texture and the stone-ground will produce a slightly coarser
crumb, which adds a little character to this country-style loaf.
