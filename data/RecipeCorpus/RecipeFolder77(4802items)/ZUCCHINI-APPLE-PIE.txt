Title: ZUCCHINI-APPLE PIE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2    9-inch pie crusts, unbaked
4 1/2 c  Zucchini, cut lengthwise
1 3/4 c  Granulated sugar
pn Salt
2 ts All-purpose flour
1 1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
2 ts Lemon juice
2 ts Butter or margarine
1 lg Green baking apple
Preheat oven to 375-degrees. Peel zucchini, cut lengthwise, remove
seed and cut as you would for apple pie. Cook in boiling water until
BARELY tender (about 2-3 minutes--however, I microwave for about a
minute or two in a casserole dish), but DO NOT over-cook. Drain. Cool
in ice water for 5 minutes then drain again. Pare and slice apple.
Mix zucchini and apple together with rest of ingredients. Pour into
prepared crust. Dot with butter or margarine. Cover with the top
crust and crimp the edges to seal. Bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until
the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.  If the crust
begins to brown too quickly, cover it with pieces of foil or take an
aluminum (throw-away type), cut out the middle and place the cut-out
edge over the crust edge of the pie.
