Title: ZUCCHINI SAUTE (SEGELKEN)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Red onion - thinly sliced
2 sm Zucchini - sliced about 1/4
Inch thick
2 sm Yellow summer squash -
Sliced about 1/4 inch thick
1    Or 2 large ripe tomato - cut
Into chunks
Big handful of fresh basil
Chopped
"Saute" red onion in a pan that has been lightly sprayed with Pam and
wiped and to which a tablespoon or two of water has been added, until
soft. Add squash and saute for about five minutes, turning every so
often. Add tomato and basil -- cover and cook for another five
minutes, or so, until everything has blended nicely together.

I've been making this dish for years . . . it's easy and yummy . . .
good hot or cold. I try to make it with both yellow squash and
zucchini -- but I generally use whatever I have on hand. This makes
generous servings for two ~- served over rice as a main meal. Or, I
use it as an side dish for dinner and for lunch the next day.
