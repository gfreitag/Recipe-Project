1 sm (about 2 lbs) beef or calf's
-foot, split
Horizontally and cut into 6
-pieces
1 sm Head of garlic, unpeeled and
-cut in half

Put the calf's food pieces, garlic, onion, and half the salt in a
large pan.  Put the tripe on top with the remaining salt, cover the
pan, and cook over very low heat so that is simmers for about 3
hours. Strain the meat, reserving the broth, and cut the tripe into
small squares ~ about 1 1/2 inches.  Remove the bones from the calf's
foot and chop the flesh roughly. Return the meats to the pan with the
broth, the flowered hominy, and the hominy cooking water. Taste for
salt and continue cooking over very low heat for 1 hour. Serve in
deep bowls with flour tortillas, passing around the toppings.
