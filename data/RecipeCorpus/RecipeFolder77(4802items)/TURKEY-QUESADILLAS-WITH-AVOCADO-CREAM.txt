Title: TURKEY QUESADILLAS WITH AVOCADO CREAM
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
TURKEY QUESADILLAS-----
8    Flour tortillas -- 7"
4 oz Cheese, jack -- shredded
1 c  Turkey, cooked -- shredded
4 lg Mushrooms -- thinly sliced
1/4 c  Red Bell peppers -- diced
4    Green onions
2 tb Parsley -- finely chopped
AVOCADO CREAM-----
1    Avocadoes
2 tb Lime juice
1/2 c  Yogurt
Salt -- to taste
GARNISH-----
2    Limes
Cilantro sprigs
Trim green onions of roots and all but 2" of green, then slice very
thinly.

Place half of tortillas on work surface and sprinkle each with 1/2 oz
cheese, making sure it is evenly distributed over the tortilla
surface. Scatter 1/4 c shredded turkey over each tortilla, then
sprinkle each evenly with mushrooms, red bell pepper, green onions,
and parsley. Divide remaining cheese among the tortillas, covering
each with 1/2 oz cheese. Top each with 1 remaining tortilla, creating
a sandwich. Press down on tortillas with the palm of your hand.

Make Avocado Cream: peel and seed avocado, then cut into large pieces.
Process ingredients in food processor until completely smooth. Scrape
into bowl; salt to taste and serve. Makes 1/4 c per serving.

Heat dry nonstick skillet over medium heat until very hot. Using large
spatula, place a quesadilla in skillet. Pressing down with spatula,
cook until cheese melts and tortilla browns slightly, about 2-3
minutes per side; remove from skillet. Repeat process with remaining
quesadillas.

Cut each quesadilla into quarters and serve immediately, garnished
with quartered limes, cilantro sprigs, and a dollop of Avocado Cream.

There's barely any cooking needed for these quesadillas once the
ingredients are placed between the tortillas. All it takes is a quick
saute in a dry skillet to finish up this delicious dish. My refined
Avocado Cream on top is a lovely contrast to the crispy tortillas. If
desired, serve a bowl of your favorite salsa alongside.
