Title: TIPS FOR MAKING YEAST PRODUCTS (BREAD~ ROLLS~
Categories: Breads, Misc
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Recipe hint
1. Choose a quick rising dry yeast. This will speed up the dough
making
process. 2. Make sure yeast is fresh. Store in a cool dry place. 3.
Start with all ingredients at room temperature. Cold ingredients will
make rising time very long. 4. Heat milk or water only to proper
temperature (110-115 deg f if
dissolving dry yeast in liquid, or 120-130 deg f if mixing dry
yeast with
flour). 5. Follow one of the mixing methods (premix yeast with
liquid, 1/4 cup
liquid for each 1/4 oz. pkg yeast) or (mix dry yeast with flour and
mix
with liquid). 6. Always check temperature of liquid with
thermometer, bakers who guess
often play it safe and use liquid that is too cool. 7. Choose a warm
place to let yeast products rise. Cover dough and let
rise in oven. (warm oven first by turning it on to lowest
temperature for
one minute. Turn off and place covered dough in warm oven).

************** *** YEAST BAKING PROBLEMS:: Crust too thick 1. too
much flour 2. insufficient rising 3. oven temperature too low Baked
loaf crumbles easily 1. dough not well mixed 2. too much flour added
3. rising place to warm 4. dough allowed to rise too long 5. oven
temperature too low Bread has sour taste 1. rising place too warm and
dough rose too fast 2. dough rose too long before baking Dough does
not rise 1. too cool liquid for dissolving yeast 2. too stiff a dough
3. too cool a rising place Bread has dark streaks 1. uneven mixing or
kneading 2. bowl greased too heavily 3. dough not covered during
rising Bread has holes in it 1. air not completely pressed out of
dough during shaping of loaves 2. dough rose too long before baking
Bread is doughy on bottom 1. bread not removed from pans and allowed
too cool on racks. Bread has excessive break on sides 1. oven too hot
2. insufficient rising time 3. improper shaping Tops of bread loaves
crack 1. bread cooled too rapidly 2. dough too stiff 3. dough not
mixed well Bread doesn't rise in oven 1. rising place too warm 2.
dough allowed to rise too long Bread is heavy and compact 1. too much
flour 2. dough not allowed too rise long enough 3. some flours create
heavier breads ( whole wheat, rye ) Bread is wet inside and corse
grained 1. loaf underbaked 2. insufficient rising time Bread doesn't
brown on sides 1. pans too bright and reflect heat away from sides 2.
poor pan placement in oven.....overcrowded Bread smells and tastes of
yeast 1. rising time too long 2. too warm a place for rising Bread is
dry and has corse grain 1. too much flour 2. dough not kneaded enough
3. rising time too long 4. oven temperature too low Bread falls in
oven 1. dough rose too long and got too light
