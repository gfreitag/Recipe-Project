hot milk mixture into the eggs, then add eggs to saucepan and return
to heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and

custard over bread cubes, and let soak for 30 minutes. Brush
individual molds (or ovenproof soup cups) with melted butter and fill
with custard-bread mix. Brush tops with butter, and place molds in a
shallow baking pan. Pour a little water into the pan, and bake at 350
degrees for 45 minutes. Cool slightly, unmold and serve with whiskey
sauce. If desired, top with vanilla ice cream and grated white
chocolate.

Whiskey Sauce: Beat eggs with cornstarch.  In a saucepan, melt
unsalted butter with sugar and whiskey. Off the heat, beat a little
of the hot butter into the egg mixture, then quickly stir egg mixture
into the saucepan.  Cook, stirring over low heat, until thick and
glossy.
