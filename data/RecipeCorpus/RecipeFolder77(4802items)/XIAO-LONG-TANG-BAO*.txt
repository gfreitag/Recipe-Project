Little juicy steamed rolls ...Juicy steamed buns with pork

Mix first 8 ingredients. Divide into 24 portions. Cut aspic into 24
portions. Knead dough 5 min; roll out into a thin baguette; cut into
24 pieces. Flatten each piece into a 2" round; then go around with
your fingers and squeeze the edges thin - the result should be a
medium-thin center and a thin outside. Put 1 portion (1/2 oz) filling
in the center of each round; top with 1 portion of aspic. Bring up
the sides of each round and twist up in a decorative pattern, making
sure to seal the top. If holes appear, patch them at once!

Put each dumpling on a square of waxed paper or a piece of bok choy
leaf and steam, preferably in a bamboo steamer, for 8 min. Serve hot.

Note on aspic:

If you don't have any on hand, use about 1 1/2 c of homemade chicken
broth (or good-quality canned low-salt broth): boil 1 c of broth,
uncovered, for about 2 min (reducing it quite a bit) while dissolving
1 envelope gelatin in the other 1/2 c. Mix together and stir over low
heat until all gelatin is dissolved. Chill. This will make a hard
aspic, enough for 3 recipes of this dim sum.
