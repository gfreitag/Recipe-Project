Combine the ingredients for the syrup in a non-reactive saucepan and
bring to a simmer. Simmer for 3 or 4 minutes then add tofu and gently
simmer for 8-10 minutes more being careful not to break the tofu
block into pieces. Carefully remove tofu and set aside in a shallow
bowl. Strain syrup and pour over tofu and allow to cool.
