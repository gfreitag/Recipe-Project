1 x  Block tofu, drained
2 x  Eggs
1/3 c  Lowfat milk
1/2 ts Oregano, crushed
1/8 ts Garlic miced or g. powder
1 c  Shredded lowfat cheese
2 c  Steamed broccoli
1/2 c  Onion
1 x  Hot pepper, your favorite
1/3 c  Picante sauce, your choice
make or buy a regular pie crust.  bake it at 375 for about 10 min. or
until starting to get done.  remove pie crust from oven. or make
oatmeal and walnut pie crust, i tried it, i prefer regualar. in food
processor or blender, whirrrrrrr up the tofu block (drained) and
eggs, milk, spices. stir in half the grated cheese. last of all, stir
in picante sauce (but don't whirrrr) and broccoli (but don't
whirrrr.) you can add ingredients to make this even hotter, use your
imagination. you may also add meat, your choice. chicken wouldn't be
bad. fold all these ingredients which are now in suspended animation
in the tofu-egg-cheese mixture, into the ready pie crust, and add
rest of cheese on top. bake at about 375 for about 35 to 40 mins.
quiche is done when a fork in the middle comes out clean. it will cut
much better after cool. the predominant taste will be the hot sauce
and you won't taste tofu or anything weird, but you will know you are
getting low-cal nourishment from the lowly bean and you can act smug
around your friends.
