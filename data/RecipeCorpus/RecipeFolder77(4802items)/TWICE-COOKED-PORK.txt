Place pork, sherry, and ginger slice in a 2-quart pan. Cut 1 of the
green onions in half crosswise and add to pork, then add enough water
to barely cover meat. Bring to a simmer; cover and simmer until meat
is tender when pierced (about 45 minutes).

Lift meat from broth and refrigerate until cold.  Then cut into 1
1/2-inch-square pieces about 1/8 inch thick. (The fatty parts are
considered a delicacy, but remove them if you wish.)

In a bowl, combine hot bean sauce, hoisin sauce, soy, and sugar. Seed
bell peppers and cut into 1-inch squares; cut remaining green onions
into 1-inch lengths. Place a wok over high heat; when wok is hot, add
2 tbs. of the oil. When oil is hot, add bell peppers and stir fry for
1 1/2 minutes, adding a few drops of water if wok appears dry.
Sprinkle with salt and stir once, then remove peppers from wok. Add
remaining 1 tbs. oil to wok. When oil begins to heat, add garlic and
minced ginger and stir once; then add pork and stir-fry for 1 minute.
Add bean sauce mixture and toss until pork is coated with sauce.
Return bell peppers to wok along with onion. Stir-fry for 30 seconds
to heat through. EAT-L Gary Watson
