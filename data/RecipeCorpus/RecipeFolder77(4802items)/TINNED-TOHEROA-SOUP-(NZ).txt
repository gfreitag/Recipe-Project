Toheroas are considered New Zealand's greatest delicacy. Their flavor
is quite unique. This shellfish is like a very large cockle. It
burrows into the sand and is only to be found on certain beaches and
the season in which it can be gathered is strictly limited as is the
catch which can be taken on any one day. When the toheroa gathering
season is on, New Zealanders in their thousands flock to these
beaches to dig by hand or wooden implement (metal ones are not
permitted) for these succulent molluscs. Since a visit to New Zealand
is necessary adjunct to getting fresh toheroas here is a recipe which
uses the tinned variety for those who cannot visit "the land of the
long white cloud".

1. Boil the fish heads in water for 15-20 minutes with salt and pepper

2. Strain and add minced toheroas from can to the stock and a little
grated onion.

3. Simmer gently for 15 minutes and add milk.

4. Thicken with a little flour and water paste.

5. Whip the cream and add just before serving. Serves 4
