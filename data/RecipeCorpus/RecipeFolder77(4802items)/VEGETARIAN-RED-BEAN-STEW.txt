Wash, sort and generally pick over the dried beans, discarding debris.
Place the beans in a pot with 2 quarts of water; bring to a boil.
Cover, reduce to a gentle simmer and cookuntil the small beans are
creamy, not powdery, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from the heat. ^ Heat
the olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
Cook the onions with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the black pepper
until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic, reduce the heat and
cook, stirring frequently, until the aroma is released. ^ Pour the
red beans and cooking liquid into the stockpot, along with the chili
peppers, parsnips and carrots. Turn the heat up to medium and cook at
a low boil for 10 minutes. Add the remaining vegetables and 1
teaspoon salt. Simmer until all the vegetables are soft, about 10 to
15 minutes longer. Ladle into large bowls and serve hot with a dollop
of salsa. Yield: 4 to 6 servings
