2 c  Veal stock; or water
3 c  Red wine
1 tb Dried onion; crushed
2    Cl Garlic; crushed

Recipe by: plgold@ix.netcom.com (Pat Gold) 1. "Hot-marinade" the
venison by combining it with the water or stock, wine, onion, garlic,
and salt, and bring all these ingredients to a boil. Let them simmer,
covered, for 1 hour, or until the venison is tender.

2.  Add currants or currant jelly and chanterelles, and bring back to
a boil.  Thicken with the arrowroot-and-water mixture. The use of
currant jelly instead of fresh currants will make a slightly sweeter
sauce. Adjust for salt, and serve with rice.

Notes: Currants are a favorite in European cooking because they
combine fruitiness with acidity. Chanterelles are the best mushrooms
to use with game because of their almost fruitlike flavor.

Serve with apricot rice and a Sterling Vineyards Merlot.

Serves 4.
