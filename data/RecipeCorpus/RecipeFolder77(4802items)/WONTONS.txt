Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Side dish
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Peanut oil
1 1/2 tb Grated fresh ginger
2 md Garlic cloves, pressed
2    Tofu cakes, crumbled
1/2 c  Finely chopped scallions
2 ts Dark sesame oil
2 tb Tamari soy sauce
50    Wonton wrappers
Bowl of lukewarm water
Cornstarch for dusting
Heat peanut oil in a wok.  Sizzle the ginger & garlic briefly then
add tofu & stir-fry for a few minutes. Add scallions, sesame oil &
tamari & stir well.  Set aside to cool.

Set up a work area with wonton wrappers, water & cornstarch. Place a
wrapper in front of you in a diamond position. Drop a heaping
teaspoonful of filling in the centre of the wrapper. Moisten all 4
edges with water & pull the top corner down to the bottom, folding
the wrapper over the filling to make a triangle. Press edges firmly
to make a seal. Bring left & right corners together above the
filling. Overlap the tips of these corners, moisten with water &
press together. Place completed wrapper on the corn-starch platter &
continue till all wrappers are used.

FOR SOUP: Drop wontons into boiling water & cook for 5 minutes. Drain.

TO FRY: Heat 2 to 3 cups of oil in a wok till hot. Deep fry wontons in
batches till golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Drain. Serve with
dipping sauce or duck sauce.

Uncooked wontons will keep in the freezer for a good 2 months if well
wrapped.  Thaw before frying, but they can be boiled straight from
frozen & cooked 2 minutes longer.
