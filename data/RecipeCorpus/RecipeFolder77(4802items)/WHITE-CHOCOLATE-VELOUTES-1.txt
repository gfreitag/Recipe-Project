JAM WHITE CHOCOLATE CURLS: 8 oz CHUNK WHITE CHOCOLATE, -ABOUT
3/4-INCH THICK RASPBERRY SAUCE: 3 c UNSWEETENED FROZEN RASP -BERRIES
1/2 c GRANULATED SUGAR Make the sponge cake: Position a rack in the
center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-by-18 inch
jelly roll pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the
short ends of the pan. Butter the aluminum foil and the sides of the
pan. Lightly dust thebottom of the pan with flour and tap out the
excess.

In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the paddle
attachment, beat the butter at medium-high speed 1 minute, until
smooth. While continuing to beat, add 1 cup of the sugar in a steady
stream. Beat 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is light and creamy.
Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, stopping to scrape down the side
of the bowl if necessary. Beat in the vanilla andlemon rind, and
continue to beat for 2 minutes.

Sift the flour and baking powder together onto a piece of waxed
paper. Set aside.

In a grease-free 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer,
using the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites with the salt at
low speed until frothy. Gradually increase the speed to medium-high
and continue beating the whites until they start to form soft peaks.
One teaspoon at a time, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar
and continue to beat the whites until they form stiff, shiny peaks.

Beating at low speed, alternately add the flour mixture and milk to
the yolk mixture. Continue to beat at low speed for 1 minute. Using a
balloon whisk or large rubber spatula, fold the beaten whites into
the egg yolk mixture one-third at a time. Scrape the batter into the
prepared pan and spread it into a thin, even layer with an offset
metal cake spatula.

Bake the sponge cake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the center springs
back when gently pressed with a finger. Transfer the pan to a wire
rack and cool for 10 minutes. Using the foil edges as handles, lift
the cake from the pan and set it on a wire rack to cool completely.

Make the ring molds: Cut eight 9 1/2-by-2 1/2-inch strips out of stiff
paper (unused manila folders work well). Bring the short ends of each
strip together, overlapping by 1/2 inch, and tape the outside seams
with masking tape. The ring molds should be approximately 2 3/4
inches in diameter.

Line the molds: Using a 2 3/4-inch round cookie cutter or one of the
prepared ring molds, cut out 8 rounds of the sponge cake. Reserve the
remaining sponge cake for garnish. Line a baking sheet with aluminum
foil and place the cake rounds on it. Moisten each cake round with
some of the Framboise liqueur. Place one ring mold over each cake
round, so that the mold touches the bottom of the baking sheet.

Make the white chocolate veloute: Melt the white chocolate according
to the directions in the Chocolate Key. Set aside to cool.

In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using
the wire whip attachment, whip the cream until it just begins to
mound. Set aside in the refrigerator.
