Title: TURKEY SOUP FROM LOREN MARTIN
Categories: Soups, Poultry, Cyberealm
Yield: 12 Servings
1 ea Meaty turkey carcass, left
Over from 20 pound bird
4 qt Water or broth
1 tb Chopped garlic
3 c  Chopped celery
1 ea Large onion, quartered
2 tb Peppercorns
2 c  Chopped carrots
6 ea Whole bay leaves
1 tb Sweet basil, dried
2 tb Whole dried Tarragon
1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1 c  Wild rice
Salt and pepper to taste
Take the meat off the turkey carcass as soon as dinner is over and
toss the carcass into a large pot.  Add all of the spices and water
(or broth). I usually also add a cup or two of white wine. Bring to a
boil and then reduce heat to simmer for an additional 6-8 hours. Cool
the soup and strain. If you wish, skim any fat from the broth at this
point. Return the broth to the pot, add large pieces of cooked turkey
and any coarsely chopped fresh vegetables you wish to the mixture;
add wild rice, barley, or whatever legume you wish, and simmer
(covered) until the rice is done and the vegetables are crisp-tender.
Enjoy......this also freezes well.
