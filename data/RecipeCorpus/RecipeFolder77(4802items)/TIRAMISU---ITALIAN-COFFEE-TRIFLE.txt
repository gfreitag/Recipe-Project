Categories: Cheese, Desserts, Italian
Yield: 12 Servings
2    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Marsala wine
1/2 lb Mascarpone cheese
1 c  35% Real Whipping Cream
1/2 c  Extra strong coffee, cold
2 tb Brandy
24    Dry Italian ladyfingers
6 oz Semisweet chocolate, finely
- chopped (approx 1 cup)
Ingredient notes: Orange liqueur or extra strong coffee may be used in
place of Marsala wine. Cream cheese may be used in place of mascaroine
cheese. Orange liqueur or orange juice may be used in place of brandy.
Ladyfingers should be approx 4x1-inch size. Plain cookies or cake may
be used in place of ladyfingers. 1. Make the filling by beating egg
yolks with sugar until light. Beat in Marsala. Cook gently in a
double boiler or in a stainless steel or glass bowl set over a pot of
simmering water. Cook gently, stirring constantly, until thickened.
Cool. 2. Beat mascarpone cheese until smooth and then slowly beat in
cooled custard. 3. Whip cream until light. Gently fold into cheese
mixture. Reserve. 4. Combine coffee with brandy. Reserve. 5. Line an
8-inch baking dish or trifle bowl with ladyfingers. (Do not worry if
ladyfingers do not fit exactly, break up extras and fit into spaces.)
Drizzle with half of the coffee mixture. Spread half the filling
over. Sprinkle with half the chocolate. Repeat layers starting with
ladyfingers, drizzling with remaining coffee, spreading remaining
filling over ladyfingers and topping with chocolate. 6. Refrigerate a
few hours or overnight before serving. Tiramisu can be frozen for up
to one month.
