Freeze venison until firm and solid enough to slice easily.
Curinto 1/8-inch slices witha a sharp knife or slicer, then cut
slices into strips 1 & 1/2 inches wide. Meanwhile, blend remaining
ingredients and pour over venison strips that have been arranged in
rows in a shallow baking pan. Marinate overnight in refrigerator.
Drain well.

Dehydrator: Cover trays with strips without overlapping. Dry 4 hours
at 140 F. Turn strips and rotate trays. Dry another 6 to 8 hours.
Well-dried jekry should be dark and fibrous looking and brittle
enough to splinter when bent in two.

Sun: Drying meat or venison jerky is not recommended in most climates

Oven: Lay strips of marinated meat in rows over trays being careful
not to overlap strips. Dry at 110 F until strips will splinter on the
edges when bent in two, 18 to 24 hours.
