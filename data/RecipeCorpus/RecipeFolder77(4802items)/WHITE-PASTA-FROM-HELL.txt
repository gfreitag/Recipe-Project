Ross Thompson mentioned something called "Pasta From Hell". Here's a
quick and dirty rendition that I've been making. It's good hot (sic)
or cold.

To 1 can of Progresso White Clam sauce (the stuff in the jar is a bit
better), add about half a dozen shitake (cut), several chopped
scallions, and 2-4 finely chopped Habs (dried work fine). Let the
sauce simmer about 20 minutes, then thicken with a little butter &
flour and add enough cream or milk to make sauce look white.

You can, of course, add more/less habanero as you see fit. I made a
cold pasta like this (2 cans sauce, 1/2 of a hab) for a party, and it
went over very well.
