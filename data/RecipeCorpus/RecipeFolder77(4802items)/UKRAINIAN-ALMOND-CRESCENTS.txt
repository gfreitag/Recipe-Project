Rogaliki, which means  "little horns," are a specialty of the southern
Ukraine.  They are flaky pastries stuffed with sugar and nuts, and I
warn you, they can be addictive. Although I am seldom interested in
sweets, these are "devilish horns," tempting even me to eat just one
more!

Pastry:

For the pastry, mix together the flour and yeast in a med bowl. Cut
in the butter with a pastry fork until the mixture resembles coarse
meal. Stir in the egg yolks and sour cream and mix well. The mixture
will still be crumbly.  Form the dough into a ball using your hands,
working it as little as possible.  The less you knead, the more
tender the pastry will be. The dough will be tacky.  Wrap it in waxed
paper and chill it for at least 2 hours.

Prepare the filling by combining the ground almonds and sugar in a
small bowl.  Beat together the egg whites and salt until stiff, but
not dry, and carefully fold them into the nut mixture.

Preheat the oven to 375F.  When the dough is thoroughly chilled,
divide it into three balls.  Using a floured rolling pin, roll out
three circles about 1/8" thick. Work on a well-floured surface to
prevent the dough from sticking.  Cut each circle into eight
pie-shaped wedges and spread the wedges with the filling. Starting at
the wide end, roll each wedge up like a little croissant and then
pull the ends into a curve to form a "horn." Make sure the point is
on the bottom so the "horns" will not open up while baking.

Place the almond crescents on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake
for about 30 - 40 min, until golden and puffed.
