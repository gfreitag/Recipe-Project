Title: WHEAT & SUNFLOWER SEED BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
2    Pkgs Active Dry Yeast
2 1/2 c  Warm Water
1/3 c  Brown Sugar
1/2 c  Non-Fat Dry Milk Solids
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1 c  Sunflower Seeds
3 c  Bread Flour
1    Egg White
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dissolve the yeast in the warm (105
degrees-115 degrees) water in a large bowl. Let stand until the yeast
foams (about 5 minutes). Add the sugar and dry milk. Stir in the
salt, oil, half the whole wheat flour and the sunflower seeds. Beat
until smooth. Stir in the remaining whole wheat flour. Beat in the
bread flour, one cup at a time, until the dough will not readily
absorb any more. Cover. Let stand for 15 minutes. Turn the dough out
onto a lightly floured board. Knead the dough until it feels smooth
and elastic (between 5 and 10 minutes). Clean the bowl and grease
thoroughly. Add the dough to the bowl. Turn the dough so that the
entire outer surface is greased. Cover. Let rise in a warm place
until doubled in bulk. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled
surface. Knead lightly to release air bubbles. Divide into equal
parts. Shape into loaves. Place the dough in greased (9" x 5") loaf
pans. Let rise until doubled in bulk. Bake until the loaves are done
(30-35 minutes).
