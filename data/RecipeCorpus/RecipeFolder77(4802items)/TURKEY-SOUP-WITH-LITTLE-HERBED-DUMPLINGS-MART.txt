1. To make dumplings, beat egg with celery leaves, herbs, water,
salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sift in flour and stir to make a thick
batter; if it isn't, add flour or water accordingly. Cover; let sit
for 1 hour.

2. To make soup, bring stock to a simmer; add parsnip and carrot. Cook
until tender, about 3 minutes, and remove with a slotted spoon. Set
aside.

3. With a rubber spatula, push dumpling batter through the holes of a
slotted spoon into simmering stock, about 1/2 C at a time, until all
batter is used. Dumplings are done as soon as they come to the
surface. When dumplings are cooked, return vegetables and add meat to
pot. Heat through; serve immediately.
