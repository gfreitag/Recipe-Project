Title: TORTILLAS DE HARINA DE TRIGO
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
1/4 lb Lard or shortening (1/2 cup)
1 lb Unbleached flour, sifted
2 ts Salt
1 c  Hot water
Using the fingers, rub the fat well into the flour. Dissolve the salt
in the water and add it to the flour mixture. Knead the dough wll for
about 3 minutes. Set it aside, covered, for at least 2 hours. Do not
refrigerate. Heat the griddle over a medium flame. Knead the dough
again for a minute or so, then take a piece of the dough and roll it
inot a ball about 1 and 1/2 inches in diameter.  Press the ball out
evenly on a floured board or pastry cloth - you are trying to roll it
out to a paper thin circle about 7 inches in diameter. With each
press of the rolling pin turn the dough around slightly to keep it
circular. Place the tortilla on the griddle - if it is the correct
heat there should be a slight sizzling sound as the dough touches it.
Leave it for 20 seconds, by which time bubbles will appear on the
surface and the underside will be speckled with dark brown. (If it
puffs up, press it back onto the griddle.) Turn the tortilla over and
cook it for a slightly shorter time on the other side. Place the
tortillas, one on top of the other in a polyethylene bag. They should
be thin light and flexible. NOTES: The tortillas can be made several
hours ahead of time and warmed for a few seconds, one at a time on a
hot griddle. They can be stored for several days in the refrigerator
or frozen as long as they are kept flat. There is no need to defrost
them before reheating. Flour should be sifted an weighed if possible.
Crisco works the best for thin tortillas. Weigh the fat at room
temperature. Makes 24 6-inch tortillas. The Cuisines of Mexico Diana
