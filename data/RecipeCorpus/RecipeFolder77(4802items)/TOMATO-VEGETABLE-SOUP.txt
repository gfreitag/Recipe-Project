Title: TOMATO VEGETABLE SOUP
Categories: Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lg Cans Italian Style tomatoes
5    Celery, chopped fine
2 md Onions chopped fine
6 c  Water - 8 c water
Vegetables of choice
Boil the above on high for at least 10 minutes.  You can chop the
tomatoes in the blender, or break them up with a spoon. I like to
squish them in my hands. gets out frustration. (i usually put the
seasoning in at this point. see below)

Add pre-cooked beans (whatever you think will taste good) to the above
mixture. you can use canned, but I like the dried beans better. I
prefer a nine-bean soup variety that's locally available. Not sure if
it's available everywhere.

Add vegetables to the above according to your tastes. Be sure to add
them according to cooking time.  No set amounts. Add them and stir.
If it looks good, go with it. If it looks like it needs more, toss
some more in.

I use:

Potatoes, cubed (makes the base nice and thick) corn zucchini summer
squash (go easy...add it late or it'll take over...i don't use it if
i'm making it for just us cause there's always leftovers and the
cabbage flavor gets stronger the longer it sits.) cabbage

you'd think carrots would taste good, but their flavor took over and
it was barely palatable.  could just be my taste, though. same with
broccoli and cauliflower.

I season it with Oregano and Black pepper, and occasionally garlic,
but go easy with this. could make it taste bitter.

We used to sprinkle parmesan cheese on it and serve with crusty
bread. now we don't use the parmesan, but i've been known to sprinkle
nutritional yeast on the top.

note:  if the soup gets thicker than you want it, add water, but add
it slowly. it'll thin out, and so will the flavor. If you do add
water toward the end, be sure to let it stew for a while longer.
