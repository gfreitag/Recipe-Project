Categories: Ground beef, Chili
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Whole wheat kernels
1/4 c  Lard
2    Onions
1 1/2 lb Ground Beef
2 tb Ground Red hot chili
2 tb Ground red mild chili
3    Garlic cloves
1/2 ts Oregano
2 ts Cumin
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Chile caribe
8 oz Green chiles; diced
8 oz Tomato paste
32 oz Tomato juice
In a heavy saucepan, boil the presoaked wheat, covered, for 1 hour in
the water used for soaking. Add more water as the kernels cook, if
necessary. Melt the suet or lard in a lrge heavy pot over medium-high
heat. Remove the rendered suet pieces, add the onions to the pot, and
cook until they are translucent. Combine the beef with the ground
chile, garlic, oregano, cumin, and salt to taste. Add this
beef-and-spice mixture to the pot with the onions. Break up any lumps
with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly
browned. Stir in the caribe, green chiles, tomato paste, and tomato
juice. Drain the wheat, reserving the liquid, and stir in the
kernels. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered,
for 1 hour. If the chili begins to get too dry, add some of the
liquid the wheat was cooked in. Taste and adjust seasonings.
