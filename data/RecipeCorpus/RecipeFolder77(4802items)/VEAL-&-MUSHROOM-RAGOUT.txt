Categories: Artichokes, Mushrooms, Veal, Wine, Company dis
4 md leeks ( 2 lbs.) cut into 1"
crosswise -- pieces
Yield: 6 Servings
:
1/4 lb thick sliced bacon
1 lb large whole mushrooms
2 lb veal, in 2" cubes
3 TB flour
1/4 c  dry vermouth
1 ts salt
1/4 ts pepper
9 oz pk frozen artichoke hearts
-thawed
:
2 TB chopped parsley

Two hours before serving or if doing in Microwave, 1 hour before
serving: trim leeks and cut into 1/2" rings. Rinse well and drain
well. Dice bacon and cook in 10" skillet until browned and crisp.
With slotted spoon remove bacon to paper towel. Pour off all but 1 T.
fat, reserving rest. In skillet, over Med-High heat, cook leeks until
browned. With slotted spoon remove leeks to 3 qt. casserole or
Microwave casserole. In 2 T more bacon fat or oil, cook mushrooms
until browned. Remove with slotted spoon to casserole. Leave
drippings in pan. Coat veal with flour in plastic bag. Cook in
drippings over Med-High heat, 1/3 at a time until well browned.
Remove as browned to casserole. Add vermouth, salt, pepper and water
to skillet. Stir to loosen brown bits. Stir into ingredients in
casserole. Cover and bake at 350 F. for 45 minutes or Microwave on
High for 15 minutes. Stir several times if doing in Microwave. Stir
in artichokes, broken. Cover and bake for 15 minutes more or
Microwave on Med-High for about 3 minutes. (I added a little more
water at this point to allow a little juice for serving over rice.)
Cook until all ingredients are tender. Sprinkle with chopped parsley
and drained cooked bacon bits. Posted by bobbi744@sojourn.com
