Gather beans, carrots, and peppers into 8 bunches, using an
assortment of each. Carefully tie each bundle with a cooled green
onion strip. Place bundles in a steamer basket and set in a large
saucepan or skillet. Steam over boiling water 7 minutes or until
vegetables are tender-crisp.

To prepare Dijonaise Sauce: In saucepan over medium heat, melt
butter, stir in flour, salt and pepper. Add milk. Cook and stir until
the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more.
Remove from heat and stir in mustard.

Spoon sauce over steamed bundles. Or pool on a platter and arrange
bundles over the sauce.

From the Oregonian FOODday, 1/5/93.
