Title: WILTSHIRE LARDY CAKE
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb Strong white bread flour
1 ts Easy-blend yeast
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 oz Melted lard
1/4 pt Warm water (or milk & water)
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
1/4 lb Pure pork lard; diced
Lard for greasing the pan
Cinnamon
Allspice
Demerara sugar
MMMMM-----------------MIX TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING----------------------
1 oz Sultanas; chopped
1 oz Raisins; chopped
1 oz Currents; chopped
1 oz Chopped candied peel
Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead the
dough. Cover it with oiled polythene and leave to rise until doubled
in size; this will take about 1 hour in a warm place.

Knock back the dough, knead it again briefly and roll out to an
oblong. Mix together 1-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon
ground allspice and 2 ounces sugar and sprinkle half of this mixture
over the dough. Add half the dried fruits and half the diced lard.
Roll up the dough, like a swiss roll, give it a quarter turn and roll
it out to an oblong again. Sprinkle with sugar and spices, dried
fruits and fat exactly as before. Then roll up and roll out the dough
to an oblong once again, but this time make it the right size to fit
a shallow baking or roasting tin about 7-inches square. Grease the
tin and put the dough into it, pressing it well into the corners.
Cover and leave to prove (rise) until the dough is light, puffy and
well risen.

Score the top of the dough with a diamond pattern, brush with melted
lard and sprinkle on 1 ounce of sugar. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark
7 until cooked to a golden brown and smelling delicious, 35-40
minutes.

Cool the cake briefly in the tin so that the melted fat is
re-absorbed, then serve it while still warm, cut into large sticky
fingers. Makes 1 cake
