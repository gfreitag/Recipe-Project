Title: WATKINS INDONESIAN CHICKEN SATE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lg Skinless -- boneless
Chicken
Breast halves -- 1 1/2 lbs
1/4 c  Reduced sodium soy sauce
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Dark molasses
3/4 ts WATKINS red pepper flakes
1/2 ts WATKINS Garlic Powder
Granules
1/8 ts WATKINS Ginger
With meat mallet or bottom of heavy saucepan, pound each chicken
breast half to 1/2-inch thickness between two pieces of waxed paper.
Cut breast lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips. In bowl or plastic
storage bag, place chicken and remaining ingredients;mix well.

Cover and refrigerate at least two hours, stirring or turning bag
occasionally (the longer the marinating time the spicier the chicken).

Thread chicken strips on metal or bamboo skewers.  If using bamboo
skewers, soak in water to prevent charring when broiling. Brush
generously with marinade.

Broil or grill 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until chicken is done
and tender, brushing with marinade frequently. Serve hot with Peanut
Sauce.
