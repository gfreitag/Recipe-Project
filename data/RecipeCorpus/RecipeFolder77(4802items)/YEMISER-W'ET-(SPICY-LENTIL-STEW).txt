Title: YEMISER W'ET (SPICY LENTIL STEW)
Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Dried brown lentils
1 c  Onions, finely chopped
2    Clove garlic, pressed
1/4 c  Niter Kebbeh
1 tb Berbere
1 ts Ground cumin seeds
1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
2 c  Tomatoes, finely chopped
1/4 c  Tomato paste
1 c  Vegetable stock or water
1 c  Green peas (fresh or frozen)
Salt and pepper to taste
Rinse and cook the lentils.  Bring to boil in 3 cups water. Reduce
heat to a simmer.  Simmer about 30 minutes, adding more water if
necessary, until lentils are tender. Should make about 3 cups cooked
lentils.

Meanwhile, saute the onions and garlic in the niter kebbeh, until the
onions are just translucent.  Add the berbere, cumin, and paprika and
saute for a few minutes more, stirring occasionally to prevent
burning. Mix in the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste and simmer for
another 5 to 10 minutes.  Add 1 cup of vegetable stock or water and
continue simmering.

When the lentils are cooked, drain them and mix them into the saute
mixture.  Add the green peas and cook for another 5 minutes. Add salt
and pepper to taste.

To serve Yemiser W'et, spread layers of injera on individual plates.
Place some yogurt of cottage cheese alongside a serving of w'et on
the injera and pass more injera at the table. To eat, tear off pieces
of injera, fold it around bits of stew, and, yes, eat it with your
fingers.
