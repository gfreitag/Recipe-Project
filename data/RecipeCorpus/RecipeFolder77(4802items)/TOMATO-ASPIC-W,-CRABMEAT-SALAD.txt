Lemon juice
Sprinkle gelatin over water in a saucer.  Meanwhile, heat crushed
tomatoes in a saucepan.  Stir softened gelatin into the tomatoes off
the heat. Add onion, green pepper, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco,
vinegar or lemon juice, pepper, and salt.  Mix thoroughly and pour
into a 6-cup ring mold. Refrigerate for several hours, or until
thoroughly set. To serve, loosen the aspic by placing the mold
briefly in a pan of hot water. Then turn it onto a serving plate,
making sure it is centered. Re-refrigerate until it has set again.
Toss the crabmeat with the mayonnaise and a bit of lemon juice, and
heap into the middle of the aspic ring. The crabmeat salad should not
be too seasoned because the aspic is very spicy. Serves 6-8. Source:
