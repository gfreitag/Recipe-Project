Title: TOFFEE FUDGE BROWNIES
Categories: Brownies, Chocolate, Nuts
Yield: 25 Servings
6    Heath bars; 6 3/8 oz; broken
1 c  Walnuts; chopped
1 1/4 c  Sugar
5 oz Unsweetened chocolate; chop
1/2 c  Butter; soft
4    Eggs
1 tb Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Flour
Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325~F. Grease and
flour 9 inch square baking pan. STEEL KNIFE: Combine toffee and
walnuts in work bowl and chop coarsely using 6 to 8 on/off turns.
Remove from work bowl and set aside. Combine sugar and chocolate in
work bowl and mix using 6 on/off turns, then process until chocolate
is as fine as sugar, about 1 minute. Add butter and blend 1 minute.
Add eggs, vanilla and salt and blend until fluffy, about 40 seconds,
stopping as necessary to scrape down sides of work bowl. Add flour
and toffee mixture and blend using 4 to 5 on/off turns, just until
flour is incorporated; do not overprocess (remove Steel Knife and
blend mixture gently with spatula if necessary to mix in flour
completely). Turn batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly. Bake
until tester inserted in center comes out almost clean, about 50
minutes (for firmer, cakelike brownies, bake about 5 minutes longer).
Let cool in pan on rack. Cut into 1 3/4-inch squares. Store in
airtight container. These are dark, moist and crunchy with bits of
toffee candy.
