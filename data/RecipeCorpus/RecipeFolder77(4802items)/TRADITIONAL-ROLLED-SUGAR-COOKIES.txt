3/4 c  Butter, softened
3/4 c  Sugar
1    Large egg
1 tb Grated lemon peel
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt

Food coloring
Cream butter in large mixer bowl. Add sugar; beat until light and
fluffy. Beat in egg, lemon peel and extract until well blended.
Gradually mix in flour and salt until well blended. Beat in water, a
few drops at a time, only until dough starts to come away from sides
of bowl. Shape dough into large flat disk; wrap and refrigerate 2 to
3 hours. Preheat oven to 350F. Roll dough on lightly floured surface
to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut with cookie cutters dipped in flour. Place
on buttered cookie sheets. Paint with "Edible Tempera Color", if
desired. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until cookies begin to brown around
edges. Carefully remove from cookie sheets. Cool completely on wire
racks. (Decorate as desired if cookies have not been painted.)

Edible Tempera Color - Lightly beat eggs yolks and divide evenly
among 5 small containers. Use liquid food coloring (adding a few
drops at a time) to color each mixture as desired. Apply colors with
a small clean paint brush before baking cookies.
