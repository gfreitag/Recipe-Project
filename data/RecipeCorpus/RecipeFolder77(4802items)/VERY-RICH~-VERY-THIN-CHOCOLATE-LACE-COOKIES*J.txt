Title: VERY RICH~ VERY THIN CHOCOLATE LACE COOKIES*J
Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Party
Yield: 36 Servings
1/4 lb Butter-1 stick
2 ea Chocolate-unsweetened
1 x  Egg-slightly beaten
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Sugar
Melt the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler. Combine
with egg and rest of ingredients.
Drop by scant teaspoonfuls on greased cookie sheets. The finished
cookies will be 3 to 4 inches in diameter so space them accordingly.
Bake in preheated oven of 325~ for about 12 minutes. Watch carefully
to prevent burning.  When nearly cool, remove from the cookie sheet
with spatuala. (I use the metal type.Hint-press under the cookie with
pressure against the sheet and they remove easily without crumbling)
Place on racks to cool completely. Source: Woman's Industrial Union
