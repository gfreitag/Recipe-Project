SELECT loaf size recommended by the manufacturer of your machine.

MEASURE all ingredients into bread machine pan in the order that the
bread machine manufacturer suggests.

PROCESS in basic or quick cycle on medium/normal crust setting. Remove
baked bread from pan and cool on wire rack.

TIPS: For larger nut pieces, process in fruit/nut cycle and add nuts
at the signal. To measure water, pour into transparent
liquid-ingredient measuring cup; read measurement at eye level. To
measure flour, spoon into standard dry-ingredient measuring cup and
level with knife. 1 1/2 tablespoons equal 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2
teaspoons. To toast walnuts, place in shallow baking dish. Bake at
375'F. 10-15 minutes or until golden, stirring occasionally.
