Title: VEGETARIAN ROAST
Categories: None, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
8 1/2 oz Long grain rice
7 oz Button mushrooms, finely
-chopped
5 oz Whole grain bread crumbs
5 oz Nuts (any kind such as
-almonds, brazil nuts or

5 oz Low fat mozzarella cheese
4    Eggs
4 md Carrots, grated
3 md Onions, chopped
1/4 c  Sunflower or safflower oil
1/4 c  Dried parsley
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
1/4 ts Garlic powder
**  Procedure  **

1) Cook the rice in boiling water for 30 to 35 minutes, until tender,
or use an automatic rice cooker. 250g of rice is about 2 small
automatic rice cooker cups, but please check your rice cooker to be
sure. When using an automatic rice cooker, add a little more water
for brown rice than you would for white. ie. if you cook 2 small rice
cooker cups of brown rice, then fill the rice cooker pot to the 3
level with water.

2) Thoroughly blend everything in a large bowl or pot. Then pack the
mixture into 2 medium sized (1.4 l or 1.4 quarts) loaf tins, which
have been lightly oiled.

3) Bake at 350F (180C) for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until firm to touch and
brown on top. Vegetarian Roast is traditionally served, hot or cold,
with tomato sauce or chutney.

**  Variations  **
:

Fry the onions, carrots, and mushrooms, in the oil until softened,
before adding them to the entire mixture in step #2. Serve with a
legume soup, such as pea soup or lentil stew. Replace the eggs with a
commercial egg substitute. Replace the mushrooms with green, red, or
yellow peppers. Replace the mozzarella with cheddar cheese (the older
the stronger the flavour). Replace the mushrooms with green, red, or
yellow peppers.
