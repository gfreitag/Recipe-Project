Title: WITCHES BREW MARINADE
Categories: Marinades, Sauces
Yield: 1 Recipe
2 tb Vinegar
2 tb Brown sugar
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 c  Ketchup
3 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tb Mustard (any creamy kind)
Salt & Pepper to taste
1/2 c  Cooking oil
3 tb Soy sauce
1/4 c  Bottled french dressing
Onion salt to taste
Garlic salt to taste
Meat tenderizer 1/2 t per
-lb of meat
Mix well. Marinate meat for a minimum of four hours.

Here is the absolute best meat marinade I have ever had...I found it
in "Delicious Decisions" the cookbook of the Jr. League of San Diego.
I find that very, very inexpensive London Broil (even bottom round &
shoulder) is almost butter tender when marinaded in this overnight
then grilled (although broiling is almost as good). Slice thin across
the grain & you'll surely impress guests! From goober273@aol.com Sat
