Here's my favorite recipe for tuna.

1. Buy (or preferably, catch) fresh tuna.

2. slice and reserve.

3. Mix wasabi powder with soy sauce

4. Heat sake

5. Eat.

NOTE:  You may substitute any fresh, firm white or red fleshed fish,
up to and including chicken for the tuna.

Rice is nice with this dish, though that does bring the over-all prep
time up close to a half hour.  ;-}
