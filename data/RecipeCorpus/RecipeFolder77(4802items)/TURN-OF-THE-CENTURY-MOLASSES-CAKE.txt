PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F with rack in center. Generously grease
12-cup-capacity bundt pan. Lightly dust with flour, tapping pan over
sink to remove excess flour. Combine molasses and baking soda; set
aside. Use mixer to cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, 1 at a time,
beating well after each addition. Add reserved molasses mixture. Mix
until combined. Combine flour and salt. Add alternately with milk
until combined and smooth. Transfer to prepared pan. Bake until
toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Set
pan on cooling rack; let cool 15 minutes. Gently invert pan and
remove cake. Let rest at least 45 minutes before serving. Serve warm.
Can be made a day ahead and kept at room temperature, well-covered,
or frozen up to 3 months, wrapped airtight. To serve, reheat cake
(thaw in wrapping first, if frozen), wrapped in foil in 350F oven
until warmed through, about 15 minutes (or alternately, in microwave
oven on medium power until just warmed through, not hot). Sift
confectioners' sugar over cake.
