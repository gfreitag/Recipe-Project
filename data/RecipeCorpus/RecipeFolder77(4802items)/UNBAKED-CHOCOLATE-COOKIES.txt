Title: UNBAKED CHOCOLATE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
6 tb Cocoa
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Margarine
1/2 c  Milk
3 c  Oatmeal
1 c  Coconut
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
Mix the sugar, cocoa, margarine, and milk in a saucepan. Bring to
boil and boil for about 3 minutes, or until the sugar granules
dissolve. Pour into a bowl that already contains the rest of the
ingredients, and mix thoroughly. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper
and let cool. They seem to do better if kept in the refrigerator or
freezer.
