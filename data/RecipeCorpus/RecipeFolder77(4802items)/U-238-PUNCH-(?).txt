Title: U-238 PUNCH (?)
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, Fruits
Yield: 40 Servings
1 qt Rum
1 qt Vodka
1 qt Strawberry juice
1 qt Orange juice
1 qt Pineapple juice
1 pt Fresh strawberries
1 pt Orange wedges
1 pt Pineapple chunks
Mix all ingredients well. Chill. Serve as you would punch.

This beverage's motto is: Hiroshima's favorite since '45. Guaranteed
to bomb you into the next decade!

NOTE: Orange juice and wedges and pineapple juice and chunks can be
substituted for your favorite fruit. However, the strawberries and
juice is considered MANDATORY! The vodka can also be substituted for
your favorite booze, but rum is MANDATORY!

The general rule of thumb for this recipe is: two quarts of booze
(one of which MUST be rum), and three quarts of fruit juice including
1 pint of accompanying FRESH fruit (one of the fruits MUST be
strawberries)

Personal Note: I "discovered" this one at the 1979 Milwaukee
Summerfest. Two fellow audience members were passing this stuff
around in a plastic milk jug several hours before Seals & Crofts were
to go on. How come this stuff didn't eat through the jug is beyond
me, but the drink (more of a "punch") is very tasty. I thank those
two intrepid people for this recipe. ~ Michael P. Orchekowski.
