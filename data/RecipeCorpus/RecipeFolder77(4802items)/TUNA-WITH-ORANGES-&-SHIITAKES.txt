Title: TUNA WITH ORANGES & SHIITAKES
Categories: Main dish, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Navel oranges
1/4 c  Orange-juice concentrate
1 tb Chopped fresh thyme
1 ts Soy sauce
2 cl Garlic; minced
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 lb 3/4-inch-thick tuna steak;
-cut into 4 portions
1/4 lb Shiitake mushrooms; stems
-removed, thinly sliced
-(2 cups)
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prepare 4 pieces of parchment paper or
aluminum foil for papillotes. Using a sharp knife, remove skin and
white pith from the oranges. Cut the segments away from their
surrounding membranes. Squeeze any remaining juice from the membranes
into a small bowl. Stir in orange-juice concentrate, thyme, soy
sauce, garlic and pepper. Place a piece of tuna on one half of each
opened paper heart. Distribute mushrooms and orange sections over the
tuna. Spoon orange juice mixture over top. Seal the packages and
place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the
packages have puffed. (You may want to open one package to check that
the tuna flesh is opaque.) Transfer the packages to individual
plates; let each diner open his or her own package. Serves 4. Source:
