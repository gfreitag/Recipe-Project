Title: TRIPLE TOMATO
Categories: Soup, Tomato
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Unsalted butter
1 lg Spanish onion -- coarsely
Chopped
1    Clove pressed garlic
1    Stalk celery -- peeled and
Sliced
1/2 ts Curry powder
28 oz Plum tomatoes -- canned
Chopped
4 c  Chicken stock -- or
Vegetable
1 ts Dried basil
1/4 ts Brown sugar
5    Sun-dried tomatoes
10    Cherry tomatoes
1. Melt butter over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan or
stockpot. Add onion, garlic, celery, and curry powder and cook,
covered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

2. Add plum tomatoes and their juice, stock, basil, and brown sugar
and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, partially covered,
for 1-1/2 hours.

3. Remove solids and place in a food processor or blender with
sun-dried tomatoes. Process until completely smooth, gradually adding
remaining broth.

4. Slice cherry tomatoes and float a few slices on top of each
serving.

VARIATIONS:

Omit the sun-dried tomatoes, in which case you've made Double Tomato
Soup. Cream of Triple Tomato: Decrease the chicken stock by 1/2 cup
and add 1/2 cup heavy cream or sour cream just prior to serving. For
a lower calorie and fat version use l/2 cup buttermilk or nonfat
yogurt. Omit basil and curry and replace with l/4 cup chopped dill.
