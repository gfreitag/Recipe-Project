Title: TURKEY-SAUSAGE PUFF
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Casseroles
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Bulk sausage
1/2 c  Onion; minced
1 c  Celer; diced
2    Eggs; beaten
1 c  Milk
2 c  Soft breadcrumbs
1 ts Poultry seasoning
3 c  Turkey gravy
2 c  Turkey; cooked & diced
Salt & pepper to taste
Cook the sausage over moderate heat until nearly done but not
browned, breaking the meat apart with a fork. Pour off the fat,
leaving about 2 Tbsp in the pan; add the onion and celery and
continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Combine the beaten eggs, milk,
breadcrumbs, poultry seasoning and 1 cup of the garvy. Stir in the
turkey. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. Stir in the sausage
mixture, turn into a greased 10 x 7 inch baking pan, and bake in a
350 degree oven for about 45 minutes, or until set and browned.
Remove from the oven and let stand 10 minutes. Serve with the
remaining gravy, heated.

An extremely tasty way to use leftover turkey or chicken.
