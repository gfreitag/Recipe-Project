Categories: Soups, Oz
Yield: 1 Servings
375 g  Black bean packet
2 l  Water
lg Pinch parsley
lg Pinch thyme
lg Pinch summer savory
1 ts Butter,cold
Salt & pepper to taste
4 ea Hard boiled egg yolks,choppe
1 ea Lemon,sliced
1/2 ea Glass of wine*
Few meatballs of forcemeat*
Soak the black beans in water overnight. Boil them in 2 liters of
water until they are soft. Puree the beans in a blender or push
through a sieve, reserving liquid. Return the puree to the soup pot
along with the liquid. Put the parsley,thyme,and summur savory into a
small piece of muslin,tie and put into the pot. Add butter and season
with salt and pepper. Simmer for at least 30 minutes. Just before
serving,add the egg yolks,lemon slices,wine, and meatballs.

Original authors note: "This soup is so near the flavor of real
turtle soup that few people are able to tell the difference!"

* Wine not specified. My guess is a dry white unless you like sweet
turtles. * Forcemeat is sausage meat, ground, not overly spicey. I
also presume that the meatballs are cooked somewhere along the way
but it doesn't mention it in the recipe.
