Categories: Breads
Yield: 16 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 tb Light or dark brown sugar
pn Ground ginger
1 1/4 c  Warm water (105-115'F.)
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
Cornmeal for dusting baking
-sheet
In large bowl, dissolve yeast, brown sugar, and ginger in warm water.
Let stand 5 minutes until yeast foams. Add salt and bread flour; beat
well. Stir in whole wheat flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto
lightly floured board and kneed 10 minutes or until dough is springy,
smooth and satiny. Wash bowl, grease it, and add dough to bowl; turn
over to grease top. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about
1    hour.

Lightly oil or grease a 14x17" baking sheet and sprinkle with
cornmeal; set aside. Punch down the dough. Divide in half and, on a
lightly floured surface, shape into long loaves, rolling each piece
first into a 5x12" rectangle, then rolling each up along the long
side to make a long, narrow loaf. Pinch ends to seal.

Place loaves, seam side down, on prepared baking sheet. Make 4-5
slashes across each loaf with sharp knife or razor blade. Let rise
until doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush each loaf with water and
sprinkle with whole wheat flour. Bake in a preheated 400'F. oven for
15-20 minutes, until loaves are browned and crisp; remove to a wire
rack to cool completely.

Makes 2 loaves; serve 16.
