Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Warm water
2 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Plain yogurt
1/4 c  9-grain cereal
1 c  Bran flakes

1    Egg yolk; mixed with
1 tb Water
IN A LARGE MIXING BOWL, stir the warm water and yeast together, and
let stand for a minute or so to dissolve. Stir in the yogurt, 9-grain
cereal, bran flakes, salt, butter, rye flour and 1 1/2 cups of the
all-purpose flour. Beat vigorously until well blended. Add enough
all-purpose flour to make a manageable dough, then turn out onto a
lightly floured surface. Knead for a few minutes, then let rest for
10 minutes. Resume kneading for a good 10 minutes, until the dough is
elastic, sprinkling on a little more all-purpose flour as necessary
to keep it from being too sticky. Knead in the fennel seeds. Place in
a large greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a clean damp cloth,
and let rise until double in bulk. Punch the dough down and divide
into 3 equal parts. Roll each piece into a long round strand about
3/4-inch thick, making them all the same length. Pinch the strands
together at one end, and braid. When you've finished braiding, pinch
both ends together firmly and tuck them under a bit, to give the loaf
a neat look. Transfer to a baking sheet that's been sprinkled with
the cornmeal, cover loosely, and let rise again until double in bulk.
Brush with the egg-yolk mixture, and bake in a preheated 350F oven
for 45 minutes. Remove from the sheet and cool on a rack. Makes 1 Loaf
