Title: TWICE-COOKED POTATOES
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
12    Potatoes (do not peel)
1 ea Garlic powder to taste
1 ea Old Bay seasoning (or chili
Powder) to taste
Scrub the potatoes and cut in half lengthwise.  Put them in a big pot
with water to cover and boil.  Cook until done (fork goes in easily),
but not falling apart. Remove the potatoes carefully with a slotted
spoon and set them on a cookie sheet or baking pan, cut side up.
Sprinkle liberally with spices. Broil until browned and crusty on the
surface. You could also bake for an hour or so if you don't have a
broiler.

I used the lower grade Idaho potatoes for this- they looked like
perfect little Idahoes, but were only about 4" long (20 lbs for
$1.99, how could I resist?). Russets would probably work well, too. I
think Yukon Golds and other thin-skinned varieties would tend to fall
apart. Seriously, using the right potatoes for any recipe can matter!
Fanatical grin ;)
