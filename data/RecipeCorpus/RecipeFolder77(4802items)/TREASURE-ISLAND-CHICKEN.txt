Title: TREASURE ISLAND CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Whole chicken breasts
1/2    Stick of butter
3 tb Plain flour
3 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Ginger
1 1/2 c  Orange juice
Place the 4 chicken breasts skin side up in a greased shallow "stove
to table" baking dish (I use Corning Ware). Brush with melted butter
(or margerine).  Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt 1/2 stick of butter (or margerine). Combine the flour,
sugar, salt, cinnamon and ginger in a small bowl, mix, and add to
butter. Stirring constantly, add the orange juice. Cook slowly until
thick and smooth.  Pour over chicken and bake 40 minutes longer.
