Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
4    Squares unsweetened chocolat
3/4 c  (1 1/2 sticks) margarine
2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Flour
1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
2 2/3 c  Halved strawberries
8 oz Tub chocolate nondairy
Whipped topping
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for glass dish). Line a 13
inch by 9 inch baking pan with foil, extending over edges to form
handles. Grease foil.

Cook chocolate and margarine in large microwave-safe bowl on high (100
percent power) for 2 minutes or until margarine is melted. Stir until
chocolate is completely melted.

Stir sugar into chocolate until well blended.  Mix in eggs and
vanilla. Stir in flour and nuts until well blended. Spread in
prepared pan.

Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick
inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs. Do not overbake. Cool
in pan. Refrigerate 30 minutes for easier cutting. Lift brownies out
of pan with foil handles.  Invert onto back of pan. Carefully remove
foil. Invert onto cutting board. Cut into heart shapes with cookie
cutter.

Place half of the brownies on individual dessert plates. Spoon 1/2 cup
strawberries over each brownie. Top each with 1/3 cup whipped topping.
Cover with remaining brownies. Garnish with additional strawberries.
Serve immediately.  Makes 10 to 12 heart shaped brownies or 5 to 6
servings.

Carol's note: Less calories if only a single layer of brownie is used,
increasing total servings to 10 or 12.
