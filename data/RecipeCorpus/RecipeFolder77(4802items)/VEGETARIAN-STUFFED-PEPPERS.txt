Categories: Low-cal, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Dry red kidney beans
1 c  Brown rice
6    Green peppers
3 tb Olive oil
4    Garlic (minced)
1    Onion (diced)
2    Stalks celery (diced)

1/2 ts Dried basil
1/4 ts Dried red pepper flakes
1/2 ts Dried oregano
Bring 2 1/2 cups salted water to boil, add 1 cup rice, cover and
simmer for 45 minutes (or until all liquid is absorbed). Put 2
tablespoons olive oil in frying pan and add the minced garlic. Saute
for 3 minutes, stirring so the garlic doesn't burn. Add onion,
celery, and carrots and saute for an additional 5-7 minutes. Remove
from heat and mix with the rice. Add the seasonings (all the dried
seasonings, plus salt and pepper) and mix well. Mix in the beans with
2 tablespoons of the reserved liquid. Cut the tops off the green
peppers and remove the seeds. Stand peppers in shallow baking dish
that has been brushed with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Fill peppers with
bean and rice mixture. Ladle seasoned diced tomatoes over top of each
pepper and top off each with a tablespoon of reserved liquid. Cover
dish and roast in 350' oven for 35-45 minutes or until peppers are
tender.
