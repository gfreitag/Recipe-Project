Title: VERY HERB - VERY CHEESE CREPES
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Eggs
1    Egg yolk
3/4 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Milk
1 ts Brandy
1 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Flour (unbleached)
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Seasoning salt
1 ts Sugar
2 1/2 tb Green onion (minced)
1 1/4 ts Taragon (dried)
2 tb Parsley (finely minced)
3    Shallots (pressed)
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
12 oz Ricotta cheese
3/4 c  Parmesan (grated)
2    Shallots (pressed)
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Tarragon
1 tb Minced parsley
Whisk eggs lightly.  Whisk in rest of liquid ingredients. Gradually
sift in dry ingredients, whisking after each addition. Stir herbs
into the batter and let sit covered for an hour, or cover and
refrigerate until ready to make crepes.

With a fork, beat up and blend filling ingredients. Make the crepes
being sure to stir each time as the onion tends to sink to the
bottom. With a rubber spatula, spread a thick coat of the filling
over each crepe.

Brush the rolled up crepes with melted butter, then roll in grated
parmesan cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, then turn oven
to broil for a minute or two to lightly brown the tops.
