Title: TVP CHILI
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  TVP
x  Boiling water to cover
2 tb Taco Seasoning (more or
Less)
x  Chili powder
x  Salt
1    Green pepper
1 md To large onion, chopped
1    To 2 cloves
x  Wine or balsamic vinegar
1    16 oz can diced tomatoes
1    To 2 cans kidney beans
1    8 oz can tomato sauce
x  Chili powder
1/2    To 1 t dried basil
x  Pace medium picanti
Soak about 1 cup of TVP in boiling water, to cover, with several tbsp
taco seasoning, extra chili powder, and salt to taste...let it sit
until the TVP has soaked up much of the water and flavor from the
spices. Meanwhile, saute 1 chopped green pepper, 1 chopped med/large
onion, and 1-2 cloves finely chopped garlic in wine or balsamic
vinegar until the onion is translucent. Stir in one can of diced
tomatoes (~16 oz), one or two cans of drained and *rinsed* kidney
beans, one can of tomato sauce (8 oz), chili powder, and 1/2-1 tsp
dried basil (or several chopped leaves if fresh). Drain excess liquid
from the TVP (so there isn't a puddle of water...it can still be wet)
and add to the rest. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 20
minutes or more. To each bowl my SO and I like a big blob of Pace
medium picante, but my 6 yo likes it plain with baked Tostito's.
