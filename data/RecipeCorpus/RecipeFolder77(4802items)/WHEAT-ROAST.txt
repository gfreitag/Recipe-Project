Title: WHEAT ROAST
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Gluten flour
1/4 c  Peanut butter or tahini
2 tb Nutritional yeast
2 ts Cumin powder
1 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Onion powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 c  Water
3 tb Tamari (or soy sauce)
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/4 c  Additional water
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
1 tb Dairy-free margarine
1    Clove garlic, sliced in half
Cut peanut butter or tahini into gluten flour (as you would
shortening in corn meal - this is my enhancement). Stir in
nutritional yeast, cumin powder, coriander, garlic powder, onion
powder, salt and pepper, mixing well.

Add tamari and oil to one c of water and pour into gluten mix. Knead
into a rough ball and place into a slow cooker (crock pot) that has
been sprayed with non-stick spray.

Mix additional water (1 & 1/4 c) and cider vinegar and pour over
gluten. (I sometimes add about a tb and/or tamari of liquid smoke to
add a bit of flavor.  How about basil? Sprinkle it on. What the heck.)

Top gluten ball with margarine and garlic halves.

Cook in slow cooker on low setting for 5-7 hours.

Slice thinly and serve as you would roast beef. Makes great fajitas
and stir-fry pieces.

Note:  This recipe can also be cooked in a covered dish in a 250
degree F. oven for 3-4 hours.

Note:  Makes a "leg of wheat" roast that weighs approx. two pounds.
Double the mix for four pounds but cook in 6-quart size crock pot.

At the urging of DEEANNE, I am sharing a secret recipe with you. I
_hope_ it comes out for you.  If it doesn't, please keep it as your
secret!

(The basics of this concoction are from Shirley Wilkes-Johnson's
cooking class.  Of course, I've added some enhancements. I can't
leave well enough alone.)
