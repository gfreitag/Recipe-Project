Title: VERY BERRY WAFFLES
Categories: Breakfast, Vegetarian, Fruit
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Unbleached flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
3 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
2    Egg whites
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk, lowfat
1 tb Margarine, melted
1 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 c  Rasperries
3/4 c  Blackberries
3/4 c  Blueberries
4    Strawberries
Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 20 minutes

Coat a waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray and preheat. Combine
flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl.
Make a well in the center of the flour mix. Whisk the egg whites,
buttermilk, margarine and vanilla in another bowl. Pour egg white
mixture into flour's well, stirring until just blended. Fold in half
each of the raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. Spoon about 1
cup of the batter onto the hot waffle iron. Close and cook until
golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Repeat, coating iron with nonstick
spray between each batch. Keep waffles warm in a 250 F (120 C) oven
until all are cooked. Divide waffles onto 4 plates. Top each with
equal amounts of remaining berries and a strawberry.

Variation: You can use the batter to make pancakes, and instead of
mixing the fruit in the batter use it as a topping only.
