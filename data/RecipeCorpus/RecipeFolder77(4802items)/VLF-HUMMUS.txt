Title: VLF HUMMUS
Categories: Low-fat, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn (19 oz.) chickpeas, rinsed
-and drained
1/2    To 3/4 cup non-fat yogurt
-(depending on how creamy
-you want it)
-juice of one lemon
2    -4 cloves of garlic,
-crushed (depending on how
-much you like garlic-
2    Is enough for me, but
-others I know insist on
-more)
1/4 ts Ground cumin
-dash of black pepper
optional, depending on how strict you want to be about the vlf: 6
drops or so of toasted sesame oil (doesn't add dramatically to the
fat, but *greatly* improves the flavor for us "real" hummus fans -
makes up partially for the lack of tahini)

Combine all ingredients in blender and blend smooth. Garnish with a
dash of paprika and serve w/pita triangles, in a sandwich, etc. My
favorite is hummus on a pita with carrots, cucumbers, and lettuce
(that was lunch today, in fact!)  Hummus is so easy to make that you
can whip it up while eating breakfast to take to work (like I did
today) for all you people looking for quick lunch ideas.
