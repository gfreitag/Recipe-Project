Categories: Cookies
Yield: 8 Servings

1/3 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, chilled
1/2 c  Heavy (whipping) cream

1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
6 oz White chocolate, cut into

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, stir together the
flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch
cubes and distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry
blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in the butter until
the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, stir together
the cream, egg, and vanilla. Add the cream mixture to the flour
mixture and knead until combined. Knead in the white chocolate. With
lightly floured hands, pat the dough out on a floured work surface to
a thickness of 5/8 inch.  Cut circles in the dough with a biscuit
cutter. Gather the scraps of dough together and repeat till all the
dough is used. Bake scones on ungreased baking sheet for 15 to 20
minutes, or until lightly browned on top.  Place baking sheet on wire
rack for 5 minutes, then transfer scones to wire rack to cool. Serve
warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container. Makes 8
or 9 scones.
