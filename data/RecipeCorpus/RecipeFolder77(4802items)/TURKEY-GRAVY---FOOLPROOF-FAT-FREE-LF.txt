Yield: 10 Servings
2 c  Turkey drippings
1/8 ts Ground white pepper
1/4 ts Poultry seasoning (optional)
1 ts Chicken bouillon granules
1/4 c  Flour plus
1 tb Flour

1. Defat the pan drippings by placing them in a fat separator cup.
(If you don't have a separator cup, pour the drippings into a bowl,
add a few ice cubes, and skim off the fat once it rises and hardens.
Combine the fat-free drippings, pepper, poultry seasoning and
bouillon granules in a 1-quart saucepan and simmer over low heat for
5    minutes.

2. While the gravy is heating, combine the flour and milk in a jar
with a tight-fitting lid and shake until smooth. Slowly add the milk
mixture to the simmering broth, stirring constantly with a wire
whisk. Continue to cook and stir until the gravy is thick and bubbly.
Add the chopped giblets and egg whites and stir.

3. Transfer the gravy to a warmed gravy boat or pitcher, and serve
hot with the turkey.
