Title: VEGAN PUMPKIN PIE.
Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
10 oz Firm silken tofu
1    15 oz can pumpkin
1/2 c  Fruit source or granulated
Date sugar
1/3 c  Oil
2 tb Molasses
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Ginger
1    Unbaked crust of your
Choice
Blend all ingredients, pour into pie shell and bake for 1 hour and

maple syrup instead of the fruit source and reduce the oil to a scant
1/4 cup.
