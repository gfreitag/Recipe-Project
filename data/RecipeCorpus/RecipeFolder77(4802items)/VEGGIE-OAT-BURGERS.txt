Title: VEGGIE OAT-BURGERS
Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Water
1/2 c  Salt-reduced soy sauce or
-tamari
1/2 c  Nutritional yeast
1 lg Onion diced
1/2 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Each Oregano and Basil,
-dried
1 ts Liquid smoke (optional)
-Mushrooms, fresh or canned
-(optional) 1/4 c to 1 c
4 1/2 c  Old fashioned rolled oats
Bring all ingredients except the oats to a boil.  Turn heat to low
and stir in 4.5 cups rolled oats.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the
water is absorbed. Don't overcook. If it is too soupy, add some oats
at about 5 minutes and cook for only a few more minutes until
thickened. Fill a rectangular non-stick baking pan with the mixture
(makes square patties, easier than forming little circles). The pan
could be anywhere from 9 x 18 inches (22.5 X 45 cm.), 12 inches (30
cm.) square or larger to make patties about a half-inch (1.3 cm.)
thick. If too thin they'll be tough and will dry out. Total cooking
time is 45 minutes. Bake at 350 F. for 25 minutes. Then use a utensil
that won't scratch your pan to cut the giant burger into 3.5" to 4"
(10 cm.) square burgers and flip them over. Cook another 20 minutes.
Serve in buns or as a main course, hot or cold. Can be frozen.
