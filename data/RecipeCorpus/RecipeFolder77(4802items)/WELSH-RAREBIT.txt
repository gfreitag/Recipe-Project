Title: WELSH RAREBIT
Categories: Main dish, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
6 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
6 fl Beer; at room temperature
2    Egg yolks; beaten
1/8 ts Cayenne
1 ts Dijon mustard
3/4 c  Walnuts
2    Apples
16    Broccoli spears
8 sl Bread
Heat the grated cheese in the top of a double boiler. Mix the warm
beer with the beaten egg yolks.  When the cheese has melted, slowly
stir in the egg-beer mixture. Add the cayenne and mustard. Stir until
smooth.

Chop and toast the walnuts.  Slice the apples thinly. Steam the
broccoli spears until tender but still bright. Toast the bread.

For each serving of rarebit, start with two slices of toast. The
general idea is to cover the toast with broccoli and apples, pour
cheese sauce over them, and top with walnuts. However, I like to put
apple slices between two slices of toast, top with broccoli spears,
cover with cheese, and garnish with nuts.
