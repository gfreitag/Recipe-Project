Title: YOUNG JEWEL FRIED RICE (YEUNG CHAU CHOW FAAN)
Categories: Chinese, Rice
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Hot cooked rice
1 c  Diced roast pork
1 c  Diced cooked shrimp
1 c  Diced cooked chicken
2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
2    Scallions, chopped,
-including green ends
1 c  Shredded lettuce
2    Eggs, slightly stirred
1/4 ts Ground pepper
1 ts M.s.g.
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
Add, subtract, substitute to your heart's content.

Mix together pepper, m.s.g. and soy sauce and set aside.

Heat wok or frying pan hot and dry.  Add one half of the oil. Turn
heat to medium.  Add the eggs, and stir lightly so the whites and
yolks are mixed slightly. Remove from pan while still a little soft,
and put aside.

Turn up heat; add remainder of oil and add the meats, bean sprouts and
scallions.  Stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the hot rice. Pour soy sauce
mixture and mix thoroughly. Put back the scrambled eggs. Turn off
heat and add the lettuce.  Stir and serve.

Substitutions and Variations:  The fresh bean sprouts may not be
obtainable in your area.  You may leave them out of the recipe and
increase the amount of shredded lettuce to 2 cups. A small green
pepper, halved and finely diced is also a good substitute for the
bean sprouts, and will brighten the color.
