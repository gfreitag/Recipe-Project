Categories: Garrett, Favorites, Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Water
2 tb Applesauce
3 ts Brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
5 tb Wheat germ
1/4 c  Barley flour
4 1/2 tb Oat flour
2 1/4 c  Bread flour

Place in pan according to custom. Pg 50 Gread Bread Machine Recipes by
Garrett. WONDERFUL!  I used quick rise yeast. Original recipe calls
for 2 T butter instead of applesauce. Makes 1 1/2 lb. loaf.
Panasonic/Nat'l machines use 3 1/2 t yeast. DAK/Welbilt machines, add
2 extra T water to 1 1/2 lb. loaf. Total calories 1553 when
applesauce is used.
