This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers. I use the
carcass to make the stock first. I throw in any vegetables I want to
use up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli
and carrot greens which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too
hard by accident. After straining the stock and discarding the bones
and vegetables I use the following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways
with Chicken" cookbook, which I usually double.  I also use more
broth and less turkey than they call for, I really don't measure the
ingredients, I just add what I've got until it's as thick as I want
it and the proportions look right.

In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid,
chiles and onion; whirl until smooth. Pour into a large pan, add
broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add turkey, rice, corn,
garlic and spices. Reduce heat and simmer until heated through.

Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their
recipe calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn
tortilla chips sometimes. ~- Sandra Chaffin (fnsjc@aurora.alaska.edu)
