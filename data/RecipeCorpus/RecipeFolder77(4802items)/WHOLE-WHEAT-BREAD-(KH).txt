Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Warm water (105 for dry
Yeast, 95F for compressed
Yeast)
1 pk Yeast, active dry or
Compressed
1 1/2 c  Scalded milk, cooled to 105
Or 95F
1 c  Honey
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Salt
6    To 6 1/2 cups whole wheat
Flour
Pour water into a bowl; add yeast and stir until dissolved. Add milk,
honey, olive oil, and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon until well
blended. Stir in 4 cups of flour, 1 cup at a hme. Beat until dough is
smooth and elastic. Mix in another cup of flour. The dough will be
very stiff. Measure another cup of flour; sprinkle half of it on a
board. Turn dough onto the board. Knead dough, adding flour to board
until the dough no longer sticks. Continue kneading until dough is
not sticky (about 8 minutes). Put dough into a greased bowl about
three times the size of the dough. Turn dough to grease surface
lightly. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place for
about 2 hours, or until double in bulk. Test by inserting a finger
about 1/2 inch into dough. If indentation remains, the dough is ready
to shape. Punch dough down; squeeze out air bubbles and shape into a
smooth ball. Let rise again in warm place for about 30 minutes.
Divide into equal portions for 2 loaves. Form each into a smooth oval
loaf. Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Place the loaves seam side
down in 2 greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pans. Cover with a towel and let
rise in warm place until almost double in bulk (about 1 hour). Bake
at 375F about 30 minutes, or until crust is medium brown. Turn out of
pans at once. Cool on wire racks.
