Combine mother sauce, soy sauce, ginger, sherry, garlic and turkey
ingredients and freeze in a zip-close bag until needed. Defrost. To
serve, drain the turkey, reserving the sauce and picking out the
garlic. Heat a tablespoon of sesame oil and one of corn oil very hot
in a skillet. Add 2 cups of fresh chopped vegetables: broccoli, snow
peas, baby corn, sliced scallions - whatever you like. Drain and add
water chestnuts and bamboo shoots. Add a little of the reserved sauce
if necessary, just enough to moisten the vegetables and keep them
from sticking. Stir fry the vegetables until they are coated, then
add the turkey. When it begins to brown a bit in the oil, add the
sauce gradually until the turkey is well coated and the sauce has
thickened. Serve over rice with bowls of cashews, sliced oranges.
