1 x white cake mix with pudding (I use Pillsbury Plus) 4 x egg whites
1 1/4 C water Combine and beat above ingredients, then add 1 C. white
chocolate; melted
> > > > > > > > Measure the chocolate then melt. ( the first
time I melted, then measured, boy was that a heavy cake!) Just put
the chocolate in micro safe dish and melt at 20 sec intervals
stirring each time.

Bake at 325 degrees as you would any cake mix. Any ?'s please let me
know. I hope you enjoy it, it's great with raspberry filling! And I
think it is low in cholesterol!
