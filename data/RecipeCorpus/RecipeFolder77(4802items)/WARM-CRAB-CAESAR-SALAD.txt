Title: WARM CRAB CAESAR SALAD
Categories: Salad, Seafood
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Eggplant
2    Heads of garlic
1/2 c  Pure olive oil
4 oz Crab meat
1/4 oz Lemon juice
1/2 ts Dill, dried
Salt, cracked black pepper
-to taste
4 c  Romaine lettuce
2 c  Croutons, optional
Prepare the eggplant by cutting into strips two inches long and half
inch wide.  Salt these strips and set aside to drain excess liquid
while garlic is roasting.

Cut off the tops of the garlic, so that all the cloves are exposed,
and brush with olive oil.  Season with cracked black pepper and wrap
in foil.

Bake for one hour at 400 degrees F.

These first two steps can done ahead of time and just set aside until
needed.

Heat the oil until smoking in a medium size saute pan. Add eggplant
and saute until golden brown.  Add roasted garlic, crab, lemon juice
and dill. Saute together for 30 seconds and season with salt and
pepper.

In a large salad bowl, toss together the Romaine lettuce and saut√©ed
ingredients quickly.

Serve immediately and garnish with croutons if desired. *Note: Use
pure olive oil when cooking to avoid bitter after-taste. Yield: 2
