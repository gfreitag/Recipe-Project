Title: TURKEY STEAK NUGGETS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lg Turkey Thighs
1/2 c  Vinegar
1/4 c  Oil
1/2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Parsley flakes
1/4 ts Poultry seasoning
2 tb Clover honey
Salt and pepper to taste
Peel the skin from the turkey thighs, remove thigh bone. Feel meat
for any remaining cartilage and remove. Section thighs into major
muscle groups and slice across the grain of the muscles into strips
approx. 1/4" wide by 1-2" long.  Use all the turkey possible,
discarding any mucous tissue and fat. Place turkey strips in a
coverable container and add all ingredients. Shake well and
refrigerate for several hours, or overnight if possible. GRILLING:
Obtain a 'small fry' sheet for your grill.. an enamel sheet that sets
on top of the grill and allows you to cook small items. Heat well,
put all of turkey on sheet and use a spatula to turn often. Cook on
high approx. 20 minutes, until strips are golden brown nuggets and
firm to the touch (sample sample sample!) STIR-FRY: Add 1/2 tsp. of
liquid smoke to marinade. Stir fry in large pan or wok in hot oil,
stirring until flesh is firm and browned. SERVE: Serve plain, on rice
or noodles, with BBQ sauce or any other favorite, or in a bread,
hoagie or steak roll, or pita sandwich. Mmmm, delicious! Flavor and
texture remind you of steak.. but it's lean, no fat turkey with no
cholesterol.
