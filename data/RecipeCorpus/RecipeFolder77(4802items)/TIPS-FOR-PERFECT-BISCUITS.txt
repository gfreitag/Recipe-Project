5 ea Tips for perfect biscuits
Use your fingertips to knead dough.

Don't overwork dough.

Use shortening or butter for best texture.

Make certain baking powder is fresh.

Don't rush baking: Allow biscuits to brown nicely.

Contrary to popular belief, brush biscuits with melted butter AFTER
baking--not before.

Hint:  To save on calories and fat, spray tops of biscuits with
food release spray instead of brushing with butter--no one will ever
know the difference!! (Except the scales).
