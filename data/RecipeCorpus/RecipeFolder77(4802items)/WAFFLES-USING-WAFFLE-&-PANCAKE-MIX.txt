Title: WAFFLES USING WAFFLE & PANCAKE MIX
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 5 Servings
2    Eggs
1 1/4 c  Milk
2 tb Unsalted butter -- melted
1    Bag pancake & waffle mix
Preheat waffle iron.    Separate eggs, putting whites into small bowl
and yolks into mixing bowl.  With rotary beater or whisk, beat the
whites until they form firm peaks. With the same beater beat the
yolks until they are well mixed, then beat in milk and the melted
butter. Stir the mix into the liquid ingredients, blending it in just
until the dry ingredients are moistened (don't try to make smooth
batter). Fold in egg whites. Bake the waffles in the preheated iron
according to manufacturer's directions for heat settings, etc. When
no more steam rises from edges of iron, open and check for doneness.
Bake a little longer if it isn't done to suit you. If waffles are to
be frozen for future reheating in toaster, bake only until light
gold.  Cool on racks and wrap airtight for freezer storage.
