First prepare the marinade. If you are using fresh lemon grass, cut it
crossways into very thin slices, starting at the bulbous bottom end
and going up around 6". Discard the strawlike top. If you are using
dried lemon grass, soak it in 4 tb of hot water for an hour. Put the
chicken pieces in a bowl, add the fresh lemon grass or the drained
soaked dried lemon grass (save the soaking liquid). Peel and crush
the large garlic clove, peel the ginger and grate it finely. Add the
garlic, ginger, sugar, tomato paste, salt, chilli powder and turmeric
to the chicken. Mix, cover and set aside for 1-24 hours,
refrigerating if necessary. Peel and finely chop the two garlic
cloves. Put the oil in a wok or large, lidded frying pan and set over
a high heat. When it is hot, put in the garlic. Stir and fry for 30
secs or until the garlic is golden. Add the chicken along with its
marinade. Stir and fry for 5-6 mins or until the chicken browns a
little. Add the fish sauce and either the lemon grass soaking liquid
or 4 tb stock. Stir once and cover. Cook on a high heat for 5 mins.
Lift the lid and stir, adding another 4 tb of stock. Cover, turn the
heat to low and cook for another 5 mins. While the chicken cooks,
peel the onions and cut them into 0.75" dice. Separate the onion
layers within the diced pieces. Turn the heat under the chicken to
high, remove the wok lid, add the onion and fry for 1 minute. Lift
the chicken out its oiul and serve.
