Title: VEGE CHILI
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
2 md Sized onions, chopped
Fresh garlic, chopped (you
Decide how much)
2 1/2 tb Chili powder
2 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Dried oregano leaves,
Crushed
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
2 c  Vegetable stock (or 2 cans)
28 oz Can of peeled tomatoes,
Chopped, with juice
1    Beer
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1    Bay leaf
1 tb Cornmeal
2 lb Zucchini cut into 1 inch
Pieces
2 cn Black beans, rinsed and
Drained
1 cn 11 oz. whole kernel corn,
Drained
TVP (optional)
Cook onions over low heat until soft and translucent. Add garlic,
chili power, cumin, oregano, and cayenne. Cook a few minutes while
stirring constantly.  Add vege broth. Add tomatoes and juice, beer,
sugar, salt, and bay leaf.

Stop here and refrigerate up to two days if you are making this up
ahead of time.  When ready to finish, bring to gentle simmer and
continue.

Sprinkle cornmeal over surface slowly while stirring to avoid lumps.
(At this point, my SO got real excited and said, it's chili, look, it
looks just like chili). Add zucchini and bring to boil. Reduce heat
and simmer 5 minutes.  (Add TVP here if you are using it) Add black
beans and corn, simmer 5-15 minutes.

I served over brown rice and provided bowls of hot sauce, FF sour
cream, chopped jalapeno peppers, and chopped onions. I also had a
loaf of wheat bread and several people ate their chili with that
instead of the rice.

Yum yum.  I would imagine it's good the next day, maybe next time I'll
double the recipe so that there will be some left over.
