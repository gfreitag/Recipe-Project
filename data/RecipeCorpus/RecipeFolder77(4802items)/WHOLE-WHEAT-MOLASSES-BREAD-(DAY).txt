MMMMM---------------------FOR BREAD MACHINE--------------------------
1 pk Yeast
1 3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Better for bread flour
3 tb Brown sugar
1 tb Caraway seeds
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Water; very warm
1/4 c  Molasses
1 tb Shortening; melted
For Bread Machine:  Put the ingredients into the pan in the order
given. Select white bread. Choose high crust setting. Push Start.
This is a very moist cake-like bread, and one of our favorites. Makes
1 loaf. Scratch Method: Combine whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the
Better for bread flour, yeast and Caraway seed. Heat the water,
molasses, brown sugar, shortening and salt, just till warm, stirring
to melt the shortening. Add to the dry mix.  In an electric mixer,
beat at low speed for 30 seconds, then on high speed for 3 minutes.
Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Knead
the dough until smooth and elastic. Shape in a ball and let rise in a
greased bowl, until doubled. I speed up the rising by placing the
bowl of dough in the overn with the light turned on. Punch the dough
down and divide in half.
Shape in 2 loaves. Let rise on a greased baking sheet, until double.
Bake at 375 degrees 30 to 35 minutes. If you like the crust really
chew, brush the bread with warm water during the last 10 to 15
minutes of the baking. Remove from the sheet and cool on racks. Makes
2 loaves I have made this bread for many years. It is almost like
eating cake! My husband said he couldn't tell the difference between
when I made this from scratch, and making it in the bread machine.
