Title: TRAIL MIX TIN CAN QUICK BREAD
Categories: Dupree, Lunch
2 c  dried fruit bits
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  hot water
4 ts baking soda
1 1/2 c  sugar
1/4 c  vegetable oil
1/2 ts salt
3 c  all-purpose flour
1 c  chopped walnuts -- or
pecans
:
1/2 ts cinnamon -- optional
1/2 ts almond extract -- optional

For fruit - dried cranberries, cherries, blueberries, currants or
raisins Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two
1-pound coffee cans or 2 9x5-inch loaf pans and line bottoms with wax
paper. Grease and flour the wax paper. Place the fruit bits or
raisins in a large bowl, cover with the hot water, and stir in the
baking soda. Cover with plastic wrap and leave overnight to plump.
All of the liquid is used in the batter, so don't drain. Mix together
the fruit bits or fruit or raisins, soaking water, sugar, oil, salt,
flour, and the nuts. Stir to blend. Add the cinnamon and almond
extract if desired. The batter should be thick enough to spoon. If
thin, add a small amount of flour. Spoon the batter into the prepared
cans, filling between 1/2 to 2/3 full. Push the batter down into the
bottom with a spatula. Bake 1 hour, or until a deep, dark brown.
Remove the bread from the oven and allow to sit for 10 minutes before
slipping them out of the containers. Let the breads cool completely
on wire racks. When completely cooled, return the breads to the cans
and cover with their plastic lids or wrap tightly in plastic. They
will keep for 3 or 4 months stored in the refrigerator.  Makes 2
loaves
