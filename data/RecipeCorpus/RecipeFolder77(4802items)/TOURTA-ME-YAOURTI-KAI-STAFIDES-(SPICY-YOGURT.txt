Title: TOURTA ME YAOURTI KAI STAFIDES (SPICY YOGURT
Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Greek, Ethnic
Yield: 9 Servings
1/2 c  Sweet butter or margarine
1 c  Granulated sugar
3    Eggs
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 c  Plain yogurt
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 c  Raisins
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts (optional)
Cream the butter and sugar together, then add the eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Meanwhile, sift the flour with the
baking powder and salt and add gradually to the batter, beating on
medium speed. Combine the yogurt with the baking soda and add to the
batter, a few tablespoons at a time, along with the vanilla.

Mix together the raisins, spices, and if desired, the walnuts. Pour
half the batter into a buttered 9-inch-square pan and sprinkle half
the raisin mixture evenly over it. Pour in the rest of the batter and
top with the raisin mixture.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees F)
for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cake springs back to the touch of your
finger. Remove to a cake rack and cool in the pan. Cut into squares
or diamond shapes when cool.

Note: Cupcakes are more popular than cake squares in the larger Greek
cities.  This recipe would make a dozen cupcakes.
