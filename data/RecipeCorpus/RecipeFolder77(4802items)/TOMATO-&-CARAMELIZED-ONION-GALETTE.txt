Yield: 10 Servings
MMMMM------------------NORMA WRENN SERVES 10-12-----------------------
2 1/2 lb Yellow onions; coarsely chop
6    Fresh thyme sprigs <OR>
2 pn Dried thyme
1/4 c  Olive oil
Salt/freshly ground pepper
1 tb Fresh rosemary; minced <OR>
1 ts Dried rosemary
Yeast Dough or Pie Dough
3 oz Gorgonzola cheese
1 lg Large cherry tomatoes or
Plum tomatoes; sliced cross
-wise 1/3" thick
1 lg Egg; beaten
In a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan, cook the onions and thyme
over moderate heat, stirring once or twice, until the onions start to
turn golden, about 15 minutes.

Add 3 tablespoons of the oil, cover and cook over low heat, scraping
the pan every 10 minutes, until the onions are browned, about 1 hour.
Season with salt and pepper and 2 teaspoons of the fresh rosemary (or
all the dried rosemary).  Let cool.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  On a lightly floured baking sheet
without sides, roll out the galette dough into a 14-inch round.
(Alternatively, divide the dough into 4 even pieces and roll into
8-inch rounds.) Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a 2-inch
border. Crumble the cheese on top and overlap the tomatoes in a ring.
Season with salt and pepper and drizzle on the remaining 1 tablespoon
oil. Fold up and pleat the border of the dough.  Brush the dough with
the egg.

Bake the galette until the crust is golden, about 20 minutes for Yeast
Dough and 35 minutes for Pie Dough. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon
fresh rosemary over the top and serve hot or warm.
