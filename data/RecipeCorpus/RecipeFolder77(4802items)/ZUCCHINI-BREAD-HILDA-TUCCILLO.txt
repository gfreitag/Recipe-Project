Beat eggs, then gradually beat in sugar. Then add oil gradually also.
Combine all dry ingredients and add to first mix. Stir in raisins,
walnuts, then vanilla. Turn into greased and lightly floured loaf
pans 9 X 5 X 2 3/4. Bake on lowest rack in oven at 350F degrees for
55 minutes or until loaf tests done with clean toothpick. Remove from

still tasty.
