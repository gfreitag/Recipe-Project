3    Italian breads, about 15-in.

*  Rather than frying the meatballs, bake them at 350 degrees F.
for 35 to 45 minutes on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and
sprayed with a nonstick vegetable spray. Cut to test for doneness.
This will further reduce the fat content.  (Trish)
** Cut each of the breads in 3 pieces, with centers hollowed out;
or use 8 French rolls, each about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide.
For the sauce, heat olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium-low
heat. Add onion, bell peppers and garlic; cook for 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes along with 1 cup of reserved
juices, tomato paste, oregano, sugar, salt and black pepper.
Cook for 25 minutes.  Mash the garlic in the pot and adjust the
seasonings.  Stir in the parsley and set the sauce aside.
Prepare the meatballs:  Mix all the ingredients, except oil,
together in a bowl.  Form the mixture into 24 meatballs, each about 1
1/2 inches in diameter.
(See * note above) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch skillet over
medium-high heat and cook the meatballs in batches, shaking the pan
occasionally, for about 10 to 12 minutes or until browned and cooked
through.  Add more oil if necessary.  Remove the meatballs to paper
towels to drain.
Place the tomato sauce over medium heat to warm through. Add the
meatballs and cook for 10 to 12 minutes.
To serve, spoon about 1/4 cup of the sauce into each piece of
bread or roll, coating the interior well. Insert 3 meatballs into
each and serve immediately.
