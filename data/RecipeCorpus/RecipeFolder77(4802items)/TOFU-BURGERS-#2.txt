mixture. Add chili sauce, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, cumin,
bread crumbs and hazelnuts if desired; mix well. Place in a food

burgers in olive oil until lightly browned on bo sides. Note: This
burger is especially tasty when served with a spicy sauce made
low-sodium soy sauce mixed with chili sauce or barbecue sauce and
