From: The Meades <kmeade@ids2.idsonline.com> (by way of If ever there
was a subject close to my heart (well, my stomach is close to my
heart -- especially when I overeat), it is noodle soups. I guess that
I eat a noodle soup or stir fried noodle dish about 8 times a week,
and the repeat cycle is about 3 months. However, they have a nasty
tendency to read rather repetitively: the techniques and basic
principles involved come down to 4 or 5 "signature" dishes, of which
this is one.

When a soup is described as a "yam", it means that everything is just
tossed into the stock as it simmers. This soup is also sometimes
called Kaeng Jued Wunsen (Kaeng Jued implies a rather bland soup --
by Thai standards!).

This can be made with a variety of ingredients, but the most
interesting are probably pork (as here), beef, chicken, shrimp, meat
balls, fish balls, shrimp balls, or "monkey balls" (a mixed meat ball
~ not actually made from monkey meat!), or one of the various Thai
sausages, as well as vegetarian options (for a quick veggie variation
try marinating some tofu in dark sweet soy sauce for about 3 hours
and then using that instead of the pork).

Maggi sauce is a dark (nearly black) sauce made by the Maggi
corporation, and widely available...

Method: Mix the marinade ingredients, mix with the ground pork, and
make the pork into small meat balls, then set aside and leave to
marinate for 3 or 4 hours.

Soak and drain the noodles.

Bring the stock to a boil and add all the ingredients except the
noodles, and continue to boil until the meatballs are cooked through,
when they will float.

Remove from the heat, pour into a serving bowl and add the noodles
(note the immersion in the near boiling soup is enough to cook the
noodles).

Serve with the usual Thai table condiments (nam pla prik [chilies in
fish sauce], prik dong [chilies in vinegar], sugar, prik phom [ground
chilies], and ground peanuts. Colonel Ian F. Khuntilanont-Philpott
