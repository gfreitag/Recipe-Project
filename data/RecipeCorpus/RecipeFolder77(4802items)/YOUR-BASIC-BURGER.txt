Title: YOUR BASIC BURGER
Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Ground beef
Salt to taste
1 1/2 ts Onion powder
1/4 ts Pepper
Using a fork, gently mix meat, salt, onion powder and pepper. Shape
into 6 patties, handling meat as little as possible and taking care
not to press meat together tightly.

Broil, grill or pan-fry the patties. The length of cooking time will
depend upon whether you and your guests like your hamburgers rare,
medium or well done.
