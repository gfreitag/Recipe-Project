From: "Colonel I. F. K. Philpott" <colonel@korat1.vu-korat.ac.th> This
variation of yam talay could of course be made with any combination of
seafood you have to hand. It is a popular "pre-drink" food in Thai
bars - I leave it to the reader to guess why! fish and shrimp balls
are sold in Asian supermarkets. If you can't find them use a little
extra shrimp and crab.

Line a serving bowl with lettuce or kale leaves, Mix the non-seafood
ingredients in a saucepan, and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the
seafood and stir occasionally until the seafood is just cooked. Pour
onto the bed of lettuse, and garnish with shredded lettuce, coriander
leaves, and slices of cucumber. (serves four as an appetiser).
