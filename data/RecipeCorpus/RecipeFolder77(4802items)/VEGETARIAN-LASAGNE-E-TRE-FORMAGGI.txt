10 oz Broccoli, frozen chopped
14 1/2 oz Tomato, canned
15 oz Tomato sauce
1 c  Celery; chopped
1 c  Onion; chopped

Cook noodles and broccoli separately according to their package
directions; drain well. Set aside.

For sauce, cut up canned tomatoes. In a large saucepan stir together
undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, celery, green or sweet red pepper,
basil, bay leaves, and garlic. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer,
uncover, 20-25 minutes or till sauce is thick, stirring occasionally.
Remove bay leaves.

Meanwhile, in a bowl stir together egg, ricotta cheese, parmesan
cheese, and a quarter teaspoon of pepper. Stir in broccoli.

Spread about half a cup of the sauce in a 13x9x2" baking dish. Top
with half the noodles, half of the broccoli mixture, and half of the
remaining sauce. Repeat layers, ending with the sauce.

Bake, uncovered, in a 350 F. oven for 25 minutes; sprinkle with
Mozzarella. Bake five minutes more or till heated through. Let stand
ten minutes before serving.
