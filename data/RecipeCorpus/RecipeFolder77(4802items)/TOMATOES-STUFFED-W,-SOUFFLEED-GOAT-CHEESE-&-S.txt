Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Slice the tops off the tomatoes and scoop out the seeds and pulp.
Sprinkle the insides with salt and invert the tomatoes on paper
towels to drain.

In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Add the shallots and garlic and
saute until soft but not brown. Add the flour and continue cooking
for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously. Whisk in the half-and-half
and the sherry, cooking for 3 minutes longer and continuously
whisking until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl
and let cool slightly. Whisk in the goat cheese, egg yolks, chives,
savory, salt and pepper.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks.
Stir 1/4 of the whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it.
Carefully fold in the remaining whites.

Spoon the souffle mixture into the tomato shells, mounding it
slightly. Place the tomatoes, with their sides touching, in a lightly
oiled baking dish. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are
lightly puffed and browned.

Serve the hot tomatoes immediately on a bed of the mixed greens on
chilled plates. Drizzle on about 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette and
finish with a sprinkling or two of white pepper and basil oil.
