easily crumbled.) Take tofu from bag and squeeze to remove excess
water. Shred tofu into small pieces with fork. In a bowl combine
tofu, soy sauce, and A-1 sauce. Meanwhile, medium heat a large
skillet or a heavy cook-pot. Add oil saute' garlic and onion; add
chili powder, add cumin. Add tofu mixture to seasoned onions in the
pot, and mix well. Add chopped tomatoes with juice, tomato sauce, and
two cans of beans. Cook 15-20 minutes.
