Categories: Appetizers, Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Cream of wheat
1    Onions  cut lengthwise
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Mustard seeds
1/8 ts Urad dal
1    Cashew-nut
1/4    Lemon
1/2 c  Peas
1    Pod Garlic
1/8    Inch ginger
1    Green chilli cut into small
Pieces
1. Cook a vegetable mix with potatoes, peas, green chillies and lots
of masala. Check for salt, before you stuff it in the pastry roll; no
way to rectify it later. 2. Thaw the roll for about 10 minutes before
unfolding. 3. After the pastry roll has thawed, open it out on a flat
sheet and roll it with a pin to make it a little thinner. The pastry
sheet would now be about 12'' x  12''. 4. Cut the sheet into 6
pieces. 5. Place about 2-3 table spoons of the cooked vegetable and
fold the sheet around it. Seal all the corners by pressing the sheets
together and applying a little water. 6. Stick it into a pre-heated
oven (350 F) for about 20-30 minutes or till it browns. Make sure
that you flip it around every 5-10 minutes.
