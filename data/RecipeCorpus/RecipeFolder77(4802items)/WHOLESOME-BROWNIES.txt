Yield: 25 Brownies
-JUDI M. PHELPS
6 oz Pkg. semisweet chocolate
-chips; about 1 cup
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Quick-cooking rolled oats
1/4 c  Wheat germ
1/3 c  Nonfat dry milk
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts ;salt, if desired
1/2 c  Walnuts; chopped
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Brown sugar; packed
2 tb White sugar
1 ts Vanilla
In the top of a double boiler or in a small heavy saucepan over very
low heat, melt the chocolate chips and the butter or margarine.
Remove the pan from the heat, and stir the mixture until it is
smooth. Set it aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the oats, wheat germ, dry milk, baking
powder, salt, and nuts.  Set the mixture aside.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, and mix in the brown and white
sugars and the vanilla until the mixture is thick. Stir in the
melted-chocolate mixture. Fold in the oats mixture until it is just
blended.  Pour the batter in a greased 8-inch square baking pan.

Bake the brownies in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes
or until the top is crisp but a toothpick inserted in the center of
the pan comes out slightly moist. Set the pan on a rack to cool
completely before cutting the cake into 5 strips in each direction.
