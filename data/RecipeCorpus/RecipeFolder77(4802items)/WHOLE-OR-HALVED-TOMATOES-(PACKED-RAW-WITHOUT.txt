Categories: Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 21 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 13 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 15 to 21 quarts-an average of 3
pounds per quart.

Procedure: Wash tomatoes. Dip in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds or
until skins split, then dip in cold water Slip off skins and remove
cores. Leave whole or halve. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid
to the jars (See acidification instructions). Add 1 teaspoon of salt
per quart to the jars, if desired. Fill jars with raw tomatoes,
leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Press tomatoes in the jars until spaces
between them fill with juice. Leave 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids
and process according to the recommendations in Table 1, Table 2, or
Table 3, depending on the method of canning used.

NOTE: This section of the guide appears to contain errors in the
information given within Table 1 above. In the USDA book, there are
only TWO sizes of jars specified in the table, but there are THREE
separate lines of figures in the table, and it is not completely
clear which jar size the second and third entries refer to. I have
given the second entry's numbers as those to be used for Quart jars,
and below I have reprinted the third entry on the table, for an
unknown jar size.
