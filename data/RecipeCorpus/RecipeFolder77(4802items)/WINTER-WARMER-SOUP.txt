Title: WINTER-WARMER SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Spanish onion
2 lg Carrots
1 md Turnip/swede
1 lb Leeks
Potatoes
Handful pearl barley/rice
1    Cube vegetable stock
1 ts Dried mixed herbs
Salt and pepper to taste
Tomato puree optional
Fill a very large saucepan with lid, if possible 2/3 full with cold
water and put it on to boil. This will take a long time, so peel and
chop or slice the onion, carrots, turnip/swede and potatoes. Trim the
leeks, slice down one side, and rinse them thoroughly in cold running
water. Chop them into 1/2 inch rings. Stir the stock cube into the
boiling water. Add all the prepared vegetables, the mixed herbs, and
the pearl barley or rice as you like. Turn down the heat and simmer
gently, stirring occasionally, until the potato has cooked enough to
thicken the soup and all the other vegetables are tender, but still
recognizable. It needs about 40 minutes. Add more water if required,
a little at a time. Adjust flavor with salt and pepper, and tomato
puree if liked.
