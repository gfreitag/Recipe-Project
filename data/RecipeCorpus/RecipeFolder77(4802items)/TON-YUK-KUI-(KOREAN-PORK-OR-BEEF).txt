meat. Bake in a pre heated oven (375 F) for 50 minutes until the meat
is tender. While the meat is bak- ing take the marinade and in a

on a serving dish and pour some of the hot liquid over the pork. The
remain- der of the hot liquid can be served seperately for those who
wish  to  have more  liquid on their meat or as a gravy on their rice.
