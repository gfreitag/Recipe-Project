Categories: Appetizers, Greek, Vegetarian
Yield: 30 Servings
6 tb Olive oil
1 c  Onion, finely chopped
1/3 c  Long grain rice
3/4 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper, freshly ground
2 tb Pine nuts
2 tb Dried currants
40 ea Grape leaves, preserved
2 tb Cold water
Lemon wedges
In a heavy 10" to 12" skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil
over a moderate heat until a light haze forms above it. Add the
onions & cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are soft
& transparent but not brown.  Add the rice & stir constantly for 2 to
3 minutes, or until the grains are coated with oil. Do not let them
brown. Pour in the water, add the salt & a few grindings of pepper &
bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover
tightly, & simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender &
has absorbed all the liquid. In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of
the remaining olive oil & in it cook the pine nuts until they are a
delicate brown. Add them to the rice, then stir in the currants. In a
large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil over high heat. Drop in
the grape leaves and immediately turn off the heat. Let the leaves
soak for 1 minute, then drain them in a sieve and plunge them into a
bowl or pan of cold water to cool them quickly. Gently separate the
leaves and spread them, dull sides up, on paper towels to drain.
Layer the bottom of a heavy 2 to 3 quart casserole with 10 of the
leaves. Stuff each of the remaining 30 leaves with about 1 tablespoon
of the rice mixture. Stack the stuffed leaves, side by side and seam
sides down, in layers in the casserole and sprinkle them with the
remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the cold water. Place the
casserole over high heat for 3 minutes, reduce the heat to low and
simmer, tightly covered, for 50 minutes. Then uncover and cool to
room temperature. To serve, arrange the stuffed grape leaves
attractively on a platter or individual plates and garnish with lemon
wedges.
