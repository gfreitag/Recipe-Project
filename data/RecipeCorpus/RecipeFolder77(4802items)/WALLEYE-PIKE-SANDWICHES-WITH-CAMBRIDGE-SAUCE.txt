combine the flour and cornmeal, and season with the Creole spice.

fillets into the saute pan and fry until golden, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, spread the bread slices with a generous coating of the
Cambridge sauce. Remove the fish from the pan and drain on paper
towels. Place each piece on a slice of bread and top with another
slice. Garnish with the pickles.
