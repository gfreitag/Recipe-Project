1 tb Corn starch
1/2 c  Skim milk
1    To 2 eggs' worth of egg
Substitute or 2-4 egg
Whites
1/2 c  Fatfree or lowfat cottage
Cheese (I use 1%)
1/2 c  Fatfree plain yogurt
1 c  Reduced fat tofu (Mori Nu
Lite), cubed
x  Salt and pepper to taste
1 ds Or 2 of Tabasco sauce

1/2 c  Chopped onion, sauteed in
Liquid of choice
1/2    - 1 cup chopped fresh
Mushrooms
1 c  Chopped cooked broccoli,
Spinach or leeks
1/2 c  Fatfree mozarella cheese
x  Herbs to taste (parsley,
Basil, marjoram are all
Good)
Pour into quiche dish or pie pan sprayed briefly with Pam and bake at
350 F for 30-40 min or until a toothpick inserted slightly off center
comes out clean.  Let stand about 5 minutes before serving.

Sometimes this comes out watery (like custard sometimes does), but it
still tastes good.
