Title: VICKI'S NOGGIN-KNOCKIN' EGGNOG
Categories: Drinks, Christmas, Alcohol
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/2 c  Dark rum
1/2 c  Brandy
1/2 c  Bourbon
6 lg Eggs, separated
1 c  Sugar
3 c  Milk, whole
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
Nutmeg, grated
Combine liquors.  Beat yolks until pale and lemon-colored (I do it in
a food processor).  Add sugar a little at a time, beating till sugar
is dissolved and mixture is thick.  Slowly pour mixture in a fine
stream into the liquor, beating constantly. Beat in milk. (Food
processor bowl won't hold it all.)

Beat cream until stiff.  Beat egg whites until they are stiff; fold
carefully into whipped cream.  Slowly fold in liquor until blended.
Chill. Top with grated nutmeg.

Vicki's notes:

*  The cream *will* rise to the top.  Have to beat husband away with a
stick to guard it, whereupon I whisk the cream back in before I serve
seconds.  I know, I'll probably die of salmonella poisoning... but
what a way to go!

*  Will need 1 pint of cream, 1 pint of Meyer's dark rum, and 1/2
pint each of Jim Beam bourbon and E&J brandy.
