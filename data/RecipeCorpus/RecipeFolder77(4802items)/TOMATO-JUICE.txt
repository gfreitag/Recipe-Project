Title: TOMATO JUICE
Categories: Beverages, Canning
Yield: 1 Text  Quantity: An average of 23 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts, or an average of 14 pounds per canner load of 9 pints. A
bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 15 to 18 quarts of juice--an
average of 3-1/4 pounds per quart.

Procedure: Wash, remove stems, and trim off bruised or discolored
portions. To prevent juice from separating, quickly cut about 1 pound
of fruit into quarters and put directly into saucepan. Heat
immediately to boiling while crushing. Continue to slowly add and
crush freshly cut tomato quarters to the boiling mixture. Make sure
the mixture boils constantly and vigorously while you add the
remaining tomatoes. Simmer 5 minutes after you add all pieces. If you
are not concerned about juice separation, simply slice or quarter
tomatoes into a large saucepan. Crush, heat, and simmer for 5 minutes
before juicing.

Press both types of heated juice through a sieve or food mill to
remove skins and seeds. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid to
jars (See acidification instructions). Heat juice again to boiling.
Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jars, if desired. Fill jars
with hot tomato juice, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and
process following to the instructions in Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3
according to the method of canning used.

Table 3. Recommended process time for Tomato Juice in a weighted-gauge
pressure canner.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Pints. Process Time: 20 min. Canner
Gauge Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
5    lb.
Above 1,000 ft:
10    lb.

Gauge Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
10    lb.
Above 1,000 ft:
15    lb. . NOTE: This section of the guide appears to contain
some sort of error in the information given within Table 3 above. In
the USDA book, there are only TWO sizes of jars specified in the
table, but there are THREE separate lines of figures in the table,
and it is not completely clear which jar size the second and third
entries refer to. I have given the second entry's numbers as those to
be used for Quart jars, and below I have reprinted the third entry on
the table, for an unknown jar size.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: ??. Process Time: 10 min. Canner Gauge
Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes 0 - 1,000 ft:
15    lb.
Above 1,000 ft: Not Recommended.
