Categories: New, Text, Import
6 lg Golden Delicious apples
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  *each* raisins and chopped
walnuts
:
1/2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) butter/margarine
1/2 t  *each* ground cinnamon and
ground nutmeg
:
6    Wiggly  candy worms ("Gummy
Worms")
:
1 c  Whipping cream -- optional Core apples from blossom ends,
leaving stem ends intact. Mix raisins and walnuts and stuff into
cavities of cored apples. Set apples, stems up in a 7x12-inch pan.

In a 1 to 2 quart pan, mix brown sugar, water, butter,cinnamon, and
nutmeg; stir over high heat until mixture boils. Pour hot syrup
around apples. Bake, uncovered, in 350~ oven, basting occasionally
with syrup, until apples are tender when pierced and skin begins to
crack, 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove apples from oven; cool in pan at least 10 minutes or let cool
to room temperature.  Set each apple in a small bowl and spoon syrup
around fruit. In the top of each apple, cut a hole large enough for
one of the candy worms and tuck one end into each apple, leaving most
of the worm dangling. Offer cream to pour over apples. Makes 6
ghastly servings.
