Title: TOFU TURKEY
Categories: Vegetarian, Holiday
Yield: 8 Servings
5 lb Medium firm tofu
1/2 c  Sesame oil (no substitutes)
1/4 c  Tamari
Mash tofu well. (For optimal results, blend a firm Chinese style tofu
with a smaller portin of Japanese style, such as Mori-Nu Firm.) Line
an 11" colander with a single layer of moistened cheesecloth.
Transfer tofu to colander. Press tofu to flatten, and fold edges of
cheesecloth over it. Place a cake tin or other flat object over the
surface of the tofu and weigh it down with a heavy object (about 5
lbs) to press the liquid from the tofu.

After the tofu has drained for 1 hour, hollow out to within 1 inch of
the colander. Fill the cavity with your favorite stuffing. Pack in
stuffing and cover with the remaining tofu. Pat down so surface is
flat and firm. Oil a roast or turkey pan, place pan over colander,
and flip over so that flat surface of filled tofu faces down. Remove
cheesecloth.

Mix sesame oil and soy sauce to use as a basting liquid. Baste tofu
with liquid. Bake covered at 400 deg. F for 1 hour. Remove cover,
baste, and return to oven to bake uncovered until top becomes golden
brown, about one hour more. Baste again at least once during
remaining cooking time.
