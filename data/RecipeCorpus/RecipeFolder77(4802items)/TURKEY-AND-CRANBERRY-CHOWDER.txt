REMOVE THE MEAT FROM THE TURKEY CARCASS and reserve. You'll need
about 1 pound of meat for dinner. Break up the carcass, wrap it in
cheesecloth with bay leaves and peppercorns and set aside. Melt the
butter in a large pot, add carrot, celery and onion and cook over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in the flour,
then slowly add the water and broth. Add the carcass, cover and bring
to a boil. Remove cover and cook 45 minutes. Remove and discard the
carcass. Add potato and cook 10 minutes. Place the turkey and salt in
the pot and cook 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine
the vinegar and sugar. Let cook until there is no liquid left and the
sugar begins to turn dark golden brown. Immediately add the
cranberries. Lower heat, cover and let cook 5 minutes, or until the
cranberries compote. Pour into a serving bowl. When it's time for
dinner, strain the soup into a tureen. Decorate each soup bowl with a
mixture of diced vegetables, potato and turkey. Ladle the soup at the
table and pass the cranberry compote and sour cream.
