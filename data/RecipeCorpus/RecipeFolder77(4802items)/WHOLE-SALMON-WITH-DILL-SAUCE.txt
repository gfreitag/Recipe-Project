and allow 10 minutes for each inch of thickness; begin timing when
the liquid starts to simmer. To check for doneness, insert a metal
skewer into the thick flesh behind the gill. It should slide in
easily. A six-pound salmon needs either a fish poacher or a roasting
pan fitted with a rack at the bottom for easy fish lifting. I use a
roaster. It usually means the fish has been curved to fit in, and the
benefit of this is that it retains this jaunty pose once cooked so it
fits more easily onto a platter. Chill it carefully, then unwrap it,
and gently pull off the skin. If the fat underneath the skin is gray,
scrape it away with a knife to reveal the orange flesh. Cut down the
center of the fish to the backbone, and then ease one half of the
fillet from the bones. Gently pull off the flesh, then remove the
backbone and replace the fish. This way it is easier to serve at a
buffet. Peel and halve the cucumbers. Scrape out the seeds, and then
thinly slice them. Arrange cucumber on top of the salmon in a pattern
resembling fish scales. Slice a lemon, and arrange around the fish.
Chill well. For the sauce, combine the sour cream with the
mayonnaise, and whisk until smooth. Add the onion, lemon juice, dill,
salt and pepper. Serves 10 to 12, or more if there are other entrees.
Note: The fish can be cooked up to a day in advance and refrigerated,
tightly covered. The sauce can be made up to two days in advance and
refrigerated.
