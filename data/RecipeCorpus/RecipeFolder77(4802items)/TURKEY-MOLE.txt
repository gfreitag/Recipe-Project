Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saute pan and brown turkey on all
sides. Remove turkey and set aside. Add onion to pan and saute until
lightly browned. Add garlic, sesame seeds, cinnamon, cloves,
coriander, ground chile and chopped cilantro; cook over moderate heat
for 5 minutes. Add stock and simmer for IO minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Pour mixture into a blender or food processor. Add peanut butter,
tomato paste, raisins and chocolate and process until smooth. Return
sauce to pan, add reserved turkey and simmer, covered, until tender,
about 35 minutes. Thin with stock as necessary. Season with salt and
pepper.

Arrange turkey on a warm platter. Whisk sauce until smooth and pour
over turkey. Garnish with red pepper strips, warm tortillas and fresh
cilantro sprigs.
