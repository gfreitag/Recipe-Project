Wolfgang Puck is a German-born chef who has made his mark here in
California.  He has such goldmines as Spago's in LA and Stars in the
City plus a few more salted away around the globe. This is Wolfgang
Puck's very own punkin' pie.  How does it stack up against Grandma's?

Line a buttered 10-inch pie dish or flan ring with pastry.

Refrigerate for 1/2 hour.  Line with parchment paper and fill with pie
weights or uncooked beans.  Bake at 350F for 25 minutes, or until
crust is golden.  Let cool. Remove paper and beans.

Meanwhile, in large stainless steel saucepan, combine sugar syrup,
orange peel, Grand Marnier, vanilla bean with scrapings, cinnamon
stick and nutmeg.  Bring to boil. Stir in cranberries then reduce
heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes or until berries are softened.
Remove vanilla bean and cinnamon stick.  Spread mixture in thin layer
on bottom of tart shell. (Leftover marmalade is good served on side
with smoked meat, fowl or curry.)

In a bowl, combine pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,
cloves and pepper.  Beat in eggs, cream, half and half and bourbon,
Pour into pastry shell. Bake at 375F for 30 to 40 minutes or until
set.

Serve warm with cinnamon ice cream, if desired.
