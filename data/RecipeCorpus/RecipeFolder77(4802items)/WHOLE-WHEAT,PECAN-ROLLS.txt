Title: WHOLE WHEAT/PECAN ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 16 Servings
1 pk (or 1 tablespoon) Active Dry
-Yeast
1/2 c  Warm Water (110 to 115
-degrees)
1/3 c  Skim Milk
1 tb Dark -or- Light Brown Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
1 c  Unbleached White Flour
1    To 1-1/2 c Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 c  Raisins, dark or golden
1 tb Margarine
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
2 tb Honey
1/4 c  Pecans, chopped
Soften the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl. Add the milk,
sugar, salt and vegetable oil.  Stir to blend. Add the white flour,
1-1/4 cups of the whole wheat flour, and the raisins. Beat well. More
whole wheat flour may be added to make a stiff dough.

Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured board or counter and knead 2
to 3 minutes to develop the gluten. Put the dough in a lightly-oiled
bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place for 40
minutes, or until doubled in bulk.

Transfer to a lightly-floured surface and roll into a 16- by 6-inch
rectangle.  Spread with 1 tablespoon margarine. Sprinkle on the
cinnamon. Roll up the dough. Spread the honey and nuts evenly over
the bottom of an oiled 9-inch square pan.  Cut the dough into 1-inch
pieces and put them in the pan.  Let rise about 20 minutes, or until
doubled in bulk. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
