Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Fresh basil leaves -- firmly
Packed
2/3 c  Mild olive oil

1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1/4 ts Sugar

Place the basil leaves, olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, pepper, sugar,
salt and 2 tablespoons hot water in a blender and puree. Arrange the
tuna steaks in a baking dish large enough to hold them in a single
layer. Pour the marinade over the fish.  Cover and marinate for 3-4
hours in the refrigerator - turning the steaks occasionally. Prepare
coals for grilling for preheat the broiler.

Drain the tuna steaks and grill them over medium-hot coals or broil
4-5 inches from he heat until charred on the outside but still pink
in the center - about 3 minutes - turning the steaks once. Do not
overcook. Remove from the heat and place the steaks on warmed dinner
plates. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add to the skillet the banana, pineapple, mango, papaya, fresh
cilantro leaves, lemon juice and sugar.

Saute just until the mixture is heated through - about 30 seconds. Do
not overcook.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black
pepper. Spoon the sauteed fruit mixture over the tuna and serve
immediately.
