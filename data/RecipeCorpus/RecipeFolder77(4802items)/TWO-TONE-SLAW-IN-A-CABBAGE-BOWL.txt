============== ===
1. Carefully remove 4-6 outer leaves from head cabbage. Rinse these
and red savoy kale leaves; drain, wrap in towels, and enclose in a
plastic bag. To crisp, chill at least 30 minutes or up until next
day.
2. Rinse and drain head cabbage. Trim a thin slice from stem end so
cabbage sits steadily upright. Slice 1/2" horizontally from cabbage
top. Using a grapefruit knife, cut out center of cabbage, leaving a
wall about 1/2" thick. Finely shred trimmed cabbage; discard core.
3. In a bowl, mix shredded savoy with red cabbage. If made ahead, wrap
cabbage shell and shredded cabbage airtight and chill up until next
day.
4. Cook bacon in an 8-10" frying pan over medium-high heat until
brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Crumble and drain on towels. Add
vinegar and pepper to warm drippings in pan.
5. Mix bacon and warm dressing with shredded cabbage. Gently pull
cabbage shell to open bowl slightly; set on a platter and surround
with reserved green and red cabbage leaves. Mound salad into cabbage
bowl.
