The term "velvet" denotes a method of poaching chicken breast to turn
it white and make the texture very soft and smooth.Care must be taken
to use simmering liquid for just long enough to cook the chicken
through.Boiling water or prolonged poaching will toughen the texture.

Velvet chicken:  Heat 6 cups of water to boil. Reduce to simmer.
Remove skin from chicken breast; cut breast into 1" chunks.Simmer in
uncovered pan for 3-5 minutes, until meat is cooked through.

Sauce: In wok or sauce pan, heat chicken stock, sherry, ginger juice,
sugar & salt. When sauce is very hot, slowly add condensed milk or
cream. Stir to combine. DON'T ALLOW SAUCE TO BOIL. Dribble in corn-
starch paste to thicken. Enrich with sesame oil. Add chicken before
serving to reheat.

Rice stick: Heat oil in wok for deep-frying until hot enough to puff
up rice stick but not brown it. Fry in small batches; drain. Process
takes just seconds. Place rice stick on platter; cover with chicken.
