3 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour and sugar. Cut in
butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Form mixture into a ball
and knead until smooth. Follow the directions below for any desired
shape.

SHORTBREAD WEDGES: On an ungreased cookie sheet pat or roll dough
into an 8-inch circle. For scalloped edge, with forefinger and thumb
of the other hand. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough circle into 12
to 16 pie-shape wedges. Do not seperate wedges. Prick each wedge with
a fork, making a design. Bake at 325 degrees F. oven for 25 to 30
minutes or just until edges are light brown. While warm, re-cut
wedges. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.

THUMBPRINTS: Prepare dough as directed; shape dough into 1-inch balls.
Place balls 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Using your
thumb, press an indentation in the center of each cookie. Bake in a
325 degree F oven about 18 minutes or until bottoms are light brown
and wedges are slightly golden. Immediately spoon 1/2 teaspoon fruit
preserves (such as cherry, strawberry, or peach) into each
indentation. Cool completely, then remove cookies from cookie sheet.

PECAN SPICE SHORTBREAD: Prepare the dough as directed, except
substitute brown sugar for the sugar and add 1 teaspoon apple pie
spice to the flour mixture. Pat the dough into an ungreased 9-by-9-
by 2-inch baking pan. Sprinkle dough with 1/4 cup chopped pecans;
press nuts lightly into dough. Bake in a 325 degree oven for 23 to 25
minutes. While warm, cut into 16 2 1/4-inch squares. Cut each square
diagonally to make triangles. Cool in pan.  Drizzle with Vanilla
Icing. VANILLA ICING: In a small mixing bowl combine 1/2 cup sifted
powdered sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract. Stir in enough milk
(2 to 3 teaspoons) to make an icing of drizzling consistency.
