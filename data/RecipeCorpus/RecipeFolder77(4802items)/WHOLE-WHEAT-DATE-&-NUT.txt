Title: WHOLE WHEAT DATE & NUT
Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
-BVRF74B
1 c  Water
1 1/2 tb Canola oil
2 tb Honey
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Oats (I use quick oats)
3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1/2 c  Chopped dates
1/2 c  Chopped almonds
The dates and almonds can be added at the beep, but I usually add
them at the very beginning for better distribution. We like this
spread with cream cheese, but it's also good just as it is! I always
keep the machine open at the very beginning kneading and add flour by
the tablespoon as is neaded until it's no longer sticky. Living in a
high humidity climate sometimes I need to add quite a lot when I
don't cut down the liquid. Guess I should be keeping an eye on the
humidity before I begin baking! Thanks for your recipe.  We used to
live near Lancaster. Rhonda
