This is a recipe from the Vaud: both the pastry and the filling are
local specialities. If you cannot get Vaudois wine, use any good dry
white wine instead.

Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC.

Lightly butter and flour a tart tin with a removable base 20 cm (8
in) in diameter.

To make the pastry, put the flour, baking powder and softened butter
together in a large bowl. Rub all the ingredients together with your
fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse semolina. Add the milk
and mix it in lightly and rapidly with your fingers, without exerting
any pressure. Form the pastry to a ball, using it to collect all the
loose flour. If need be, add another drop or two of milk.

Do not let the pastry rest, but roll it out straight away to fit the
prepared tart tin.

Mix the sugar, cinnamon and flour together. Strew this mixture all
over the bottom of the tart (This is a liquid filling so the bottom
of the tart is not pricked with a fork). Pour the wine over the sugar
mixture and mix it in with your fingertips. Dot the surface with the
butter, in flakes.

Cook the tart in the bottom of the pre-heated oven for 15 to 25
minutes, turning it from time to time to equalise the heat and to
prevent bubbles forming (at the end of the cooking time, the filling
must look like "middle-firm" gelatin).

Leave the tart to cool before taking it out of the tin.
