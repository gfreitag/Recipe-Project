KAREN PHILLIPS CBTX40A-----
1 c  Pecan halves
2 c  Heavy cream
2 c  Granulated sugar
2 c  Half-and-half
1/4 ts Lemon juice
8    Egg yolks
1 oz Unsweetened chocolate --
Broken into 1/2 oz p
1/4 c  Myer's Dark Rum
EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, baking sheet with sides,
2 2 1/2-qt. saucepan, whisk, metal spoon, cook's knife, cutting
board, 2-qt. plastic container w/ lid, electric mixer with paddle,
rubber spatula, instant-read test thermometer, 2 stainless steel
bowls (1 large), ice cream freezer Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Toast the pecan halves on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 10
to 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Combine 1 1/4 cups of sugar
and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan. Stir with a whisk to
combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar
for 8 to 10 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a
whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn clear as it
liquefies, then light brown as it caramelizes). Remove the saucepan
from the heat. Add the unsweetened chocolate and stir gently to
blend. Pour the chocolate-caramel mixture over the pecans and stir
with a spoon to completely coat the pecans with the chocolate
caramel; spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the baking
sheet. Freeze the chocolate pecan crunch for 20 minutes. Remove from
the freezer. Chop the chocolate pecan crunch into 1/4" pieces. Store
in a sealed plastic container in the freezer until needed.
