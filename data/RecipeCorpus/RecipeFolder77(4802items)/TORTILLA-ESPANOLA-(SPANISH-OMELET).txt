Title: TORTILLA ESPANOLA (SPANISH OMELET)
Categories: Eggs, Spanish
Yield: 4 Servings
4 tb Olive oil
2 lg Onions; peeled & cut
-into thin slices
2 lb Potatoes, peeled & cut
-into thin slices
6    Eggs
Salt; to taste
Pepper; to taste
Heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan.  Saute the onions over
medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes or until soft but not brown. Drain the
onions in a colander, reserving 2 tablespoons of the oil from the pan.

Cook the potatoes in boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes and drain in the
colander.  Beat the eggs in a large bowl and stir in the onions and
potatoes; add salt and pepper to taste.

Heat the reserved oil over high heat in a heavy nonstick pan or a
well- seasoned cast iron skillet. Add the egg mixture and cook for 2
minutes or until the bottom is lightly browned. Place the pan in a
preheated 400-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the egg
mixture is set. Invert the tortilla onto a round platter. Cut into
wedge-shaped slices and serve with a salad.

NOTE:  In Spain, a tortilla isn't the cornmeal flat bread we think
of, but a sort of omelet loaded with onions and peppers. This is a
popular item at tapas bars, and an easy dinner to make after an
evening of celebrating.
