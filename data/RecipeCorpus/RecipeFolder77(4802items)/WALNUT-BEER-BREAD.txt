Title: WALNUT BEER BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
1 1/2 c  Warm beer
2 pk Active dry yeast
4 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
-- or as needed
1/2 c  Rye flour
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Salt
1/2 c  Walnut oil
1 c  Finely chopped yellow onion
3/4 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
1    Egg
2 ts ;Water
Fresh or dried rosemary
Heat the beer to 105 to 115 F. and pour 1/2 cup into a small bowl.
Stir in the yeast and let stand 10 minutes.

Mix the flours, sugar and salt in a large bowl.  Make a well in the
center. Pour the yeast mixture, oil and remaining 1 cup beer into the
well and stir until blended.

Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10
minutes, adding more flour if necessary.

Coat a large bowl with walnut oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and
turn to coat with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in bulk.  (You can also let the dough rise
overnight in a cool place or in the refrigerator.)

Punch dough down and knead in the onion and walnuts until evenly
distributed throughout the dough.

Divide dough in half.  Divide each half into thirds.  Using your
hands, roll each of the pieces into 12" long ropes.  Braid 3 ropes
together to form a loaf.  Tuck the ends under and place on an 18 x
12" baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, placing it on the same
baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to
1 hour.

Beat the egg and 2 tsp. water in a small bowl.  Brush the tops of the
loaves with the egg wash and sprinkle with rosemary.  Bake at 375 F.
until crusty and brown, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10
minutes. Turn out onto wire racks and cool completely.

The authors write: "A hearty and rustic bread that makes an excellent
picnic lunch with cheese, especially goat's milk cheese.  Take your
favorite full-bodied red wine along."
