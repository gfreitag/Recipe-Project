Categories: Salads
1 lb button mushrooms
Yield: 1 Servings
8 sm zucchini
1/4 c  wine vinegar
2 TB olive oil
1 ts salt
2    sprigs fresh tarragon
1/4 c  water
1/4 c  dry white wine

Clean the mushrooms.  Cut the zucchini into 1 inch lengths. Place all
ingredients in a pot.  Simmer until the zucchini is just tender. Turn
off

heat.  Place lid on pot and leave for 15 minutes. Place the drained
vegetables in a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid. Place this liquid
back in the pot and cook until reduced to about 1/3 cup. Discard the
tarragon. Pour over the vegetables and lightly chill (don't
over-chill or

it will kill the flavor). Throw on a little finely chopped parsley
before serving.
