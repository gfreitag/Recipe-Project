Categories: Italian, Meats, Seafood, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
6    Veal loin chops, 3/4" thick
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
6 tb Butter
2 oz Boiled ham, finely minced
4    Flat anchovy fillets
2 tb Capers, rinsed and drained
1/4 c  Brandy
6 tb Whipping cream
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
-(garnish)
Heat oil in a heavy skillet large enough to accommodate chops. Pat
chops dry and coat with flour, shaking off excess. Saute' chops in
very hot oil, turning once.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a small skillet and saute' ham over medium
heat 1 minute. Add anchovies and capers, mashing ingredients down
with fork to make a paste.

When chops are done, about 8 to 10 minutes, remove to a heated
ovenproof platter and keep warm in a 200 degree oven with a piece of
aluminum foil placed loosely over the top.

Pour off excess oil from skillet in which chops were cooked. Add
brandy, scraping up browned bits. Boil to reduce liquid by half, then
pour into ham and anchovy mixture. Add cream, heating and stirring
while it blends.

Pour sauce over chops and garnish with parsley. Serves 6.
