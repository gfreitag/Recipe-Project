Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Corned beef brisket
12 oz Beer
1    Bay leaf
1    Stick cinnamon
1    Green chili pepper -- dried
1/2 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Mustard seed
1/2 ts Coriander seed

* Use wok with steaming rack, or large heavy pan with rack and tight
fitting lid.

Into wok place the beer, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, chili pepper,
coriander, allspice, and mustard seed. Pour enough water to make 2
inches of liquid in bottom of wok. Heat until steaming. Place the
rack in wok. Put the corned beef on rack; cover and steam 2 hours or
until meat is fork-tender. Add more water to wok to keep up to 1-1/2
or 2 inch level. Combine mayonnaise, yellow mustard and basil. Cover
and chill. Cut cabbage into 8 wedges. When corned beef is tender,
place the cabbage on and around meat. Cover and steam about 20
minutes or until cabbage is still a little bit crisp. Remove cabbage
and corned beef. Cut beef into slices and arrange attractively on
serving platter. Place cabbage around the beef slices; spoon the
mayonnaise dressing over top of each cabbage wedge. Serve immediately.
