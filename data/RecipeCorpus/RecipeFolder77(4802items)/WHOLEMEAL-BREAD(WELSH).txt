2 lb wholemeal flour

1 1/2 pt lukewarm water
1 lb flour
5 ts salt
2 oz lard
2 ts sugar
1 oz fresh yeast

BARA GWENITH Mix the flour and salt and rub in the lard. Dissolve the
yeast in half the water and add the sugar. Make a well in the centre
of the flour. Add the yeast mixture and enough tepid water to make a
soft elastic dough. Knead well on a floured board and leave in a warm
place to rise until its size is doubled. Re-knead and divide in half.
Place in two 2 lb. greased and floured tins. Cover with a clean cloth
and leave in a warm place to rise for 20 minutes. Brush the tops of
the loaves with water and dust with wholemeal flour. Bake in a very
hot oven (450/F. or Mark 8) for 45-50 minutes.
