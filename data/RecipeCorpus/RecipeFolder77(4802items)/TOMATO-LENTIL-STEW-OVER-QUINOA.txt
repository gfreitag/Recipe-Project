Title: TOMATO LENTIL STEW OVER QUINOA
Categories: Stews, Low fat
2 c  lentils  -- washed
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lg onions
5 md tomatoes
3 TB canola oil
water
:
3/4 ts salt
1 1/2 ts marjoram
1 1/2 ts savory

In a medium-large saucepan boil lentils in water for about 30 - 40
minutes (or until thoroughly cooked). While these are cooking, chop
onions and tomatoes.  In a very large skillet or pan, sautee onions
until they are just about cooked (mostly translucent).  Add tomatoes
and stir occasionally.  Crush the marjoram and savory in your palm
and rub together to release the flavor, and add to the pan. Add the
salt. When it seems the tomatoes are fairly stewy and cooked, add the
cooked, well drained lentils (which by this time should be done).
Cook together for a few minutes to get an even mixture. To cook
quinoa, boil two parts water to one part quinoa. Add grain
(supposedly you're supposed to rinse it, but I don't have a fine
enough colander, so I do without this step).  Cover and lower to a
simmer. Cook for 15 minutes.  Stir and let sit covered off the heat
for ten minutes before serving. This is a really good dish with
steamed cauliflower and for a really neat touch, try adding some
cooked arame seaweed on top. Soak a handful of arame in cold water
(you don't need very much of this ~ a little goes a LONG way, and
it's very very dense in nutrition). In a small pan heat some oil and
add a couple cloves of chopped or pressed garlic, and a very small
amount of diced ginger (optional). Add drained and squeezed arame and
sautee for a few minutes. Add soy sauce to taste. When the arame
becomes crispy it's ready to eat. Just sprinkle on top of the stew,
or any pasta dish for that matter.
