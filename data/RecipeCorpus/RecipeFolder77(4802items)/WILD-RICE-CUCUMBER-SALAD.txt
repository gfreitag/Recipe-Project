Title: WILD RICE-CUCUMBER SALAD
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Wild rice, rinsed
3 c  Water
3    Cucumbers, sliced thick and
sl Cut into quarters
1    Red bell pepper, diced
1 bn Green onions (or 1 Vidalia
Or red onion), chopped
(the cucumbers can be increased with good results, and other
veg.added) Bring the water to a boil, add the wild rice. Return to
boil, turn down to simmer for 40 minutes or until some of the grains
burst. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Drain any excess water.
Toss cooled rice and other ingredients in a bowl.

You may use any dressing you like, but I like to use one of these:

Basil/Balsamic Vinegar Dressing [T] - I think I derived this from
something McDougall

1/3 c balsamic vinegar 1 T soy sauce 2 T water 2 T fresh basil,
chopped fine 2 cloves garlic, chopped fine 1 T onion, chopped fine
1/2 t black pepper

Combine in a jar, shake, and allow to sit, preferably overnight. The
salad will also be improved if it is dressed and allowed to sit for
several hours, which is good, since there is a lot of it!

The other dressing I use on this is from the New McDougall Cookbook,
called the Savory Salad Dressing. [T]

1 t Dijon mustard 1/4 c red wine vinegar 1/4 c water
1/4 c  soy sauce dash Tobasco sauce

Combine in jar, shake, allow to sit for a few hours.

(makes a LARGE amount, keeps well)
