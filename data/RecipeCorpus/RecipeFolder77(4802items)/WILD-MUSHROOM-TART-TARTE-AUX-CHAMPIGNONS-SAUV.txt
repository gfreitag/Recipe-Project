FOR CRUST: Blend flour and salt in processor.  Cut in butter using
on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add enough water to
blend dough. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in
plastic; chill 45 minutes.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to
9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Trim edges, leaving
1/2-inch overhang.  Fold overhang in to form double-thick sides.
Press tart edges to raise dough 1/8 inch above pan.  Chill 30 minutes.

FOR FILLING:  Bring 1 cup water to boil in saucepan. Add porcini;
remove from heat and let stand 30 inutes. Spoon porcini from liquid;
reserve liquid.  Coarsely chop procini.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add procini and
crimini mushrooms.  Season with salt; saute until deep golden, about
10 minutes. Add shallots; saute 2 minutes. Add Cognac and reserved
porcini liquid, leaving any sand behind in sauce pan. Boil until
almost all liquid is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Mix in 1 tablespoon
herbs. Cool.

Preheat oven to 375F.  Line crust with foil.  Fill with dried beans.
Bake 15 minutes.  Remove foil and beans; bake until golden, about 15
minutes. Maintain oven temperature.

Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheese in crust.  Cover with mushrooms. Whisk cream,
yolks, egg and 1 tablespoon herbs in bowl. Pour custard over
mushrooms. Top with remaining cheese. Bake until filling is set and
top is golden, about 30 minutes.  Cool on rack 15 minutes.
