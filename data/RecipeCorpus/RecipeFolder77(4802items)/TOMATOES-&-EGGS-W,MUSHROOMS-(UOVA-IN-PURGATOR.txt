Title: TOMATOES & EGGS W/MUSHROOMS (UOVA IN PURGATOR
Categories: Cheese, Italian, Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 3 Servings
3    To 4 large tomatoes; peeled
-- (I used 4)
3 tb Butter or olive oil
-- (I used margarine)
1 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
6    To 8 Eggs (I used 7)
Salt and pepper; to taste
3/4 c  Shredded Jack cheese (3 oz.)
Chopped fresh parsley
1    Or 2 sprinkles fresh thyme*
*My addition.

Cut tomatoes in cubes; drain in colander for several minutes.

Meanwhile, in 10 or 11" frying pan over high heat (I used 10" pan),
melt margarine.  Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until they are
soft and juices have evaporated. Add tomatoes; stir to heat through.

With spoon, make 6 to 8 nest spaces; break an egg into each space.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper; cover evenly with cheese.

Cover pan; cook on low heat until eggs are set as you like (took 20
to 30 minutes).  Garnish with parsley and thyme.

Would be good served with fruit and toast.

Yield: 3 to 4 servings.
