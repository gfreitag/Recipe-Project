Title: WATERMELON ICE
Categories: Desserts, Low-cal
Yield: 6 Servings
1 ts Unflavored gelatin
4 c  Watermelon cubes
2 tb Lime juice (or lemon)
2 tb Honey
Lime twists for garnish
In a micro-safe cup, soften gelatin in 2 tb water by heating briefly.
Stir until gelatin is dissolved.

(Suggestion:  cut up melon in a sieve to catch the seeds, over a bowl
to catch the juice or you will have lots of juice around the cutting
board.) In a blender container, combine 1 cup of melon cubes, lime
(or lemon) juice, honey and gelatin mixture.  Cover and blend at high
speed for 30 sec or until smooth.

Add remaining melon in batches, cover and blend at high speed until
smooth. Pour into a 8x8x2" pan and freeze until almost firm.

Remove from freezer and transfer mixture to a large chilled bowl.
Beat at high speed with an electric mixer or food processor until
smooth. Return to pan or pour into serving size cups or pour into
plastic ice cube trays and freeze several hours until firm.

To serve let stand 15-20 min at room temperature. Scrape surface (if
you used 8x8 pan) and spoon into serving dishes. Garnish.
