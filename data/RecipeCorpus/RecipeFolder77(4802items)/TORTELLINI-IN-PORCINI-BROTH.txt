If you haven't soaked the Porcini in advance (see note below) set
combine Porcini and water in a saucepan and bring to a simmer; let
soak for 20 minutes or until tender. Drain soaked Porcini, rinse them
to remove grit; and chop them. Strain the soaking liquid through
non-bleached paper towel or cotton cheesecloth-lined sieve; reserve
for later.

Heat the olive oil in a saucepan. When hot add chopped soaked Porcini
and saute for a few seconds. Add the fresh mushrooms, cover and cook
over very low heat until mushrooms are tender (if they begin to stick
to the bottom of the pan, add a few spoonfuls of mushroom soaking
liquid). Add reserved Porcini liquid and broth and bring to a simmer;
add tortellini and cook, uncovered for 5 minutes or until tender.
Season to taste with salt and pepper and portion out; garnish with
chives.

NOTE - to soak mushrooms in advance; cover 2 ounces of dried
mushrooms with 1 quart of water; set in refrigerator overnight or for
longer; remove soaked mushrooms and soaking liquid as needed.

Yield: 2 main course servings
