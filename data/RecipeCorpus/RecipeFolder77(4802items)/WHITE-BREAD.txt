Title: WHITE BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
1/4 c  :warm water (approx 105F)
1 pk Dry yeast
1 3/4 c  Milk
2 tb Butter; softened OR
2 tb Vegetable shortening or oil
2 tb Sugar
2 1/2 ts Salt
5 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
POUR THE WARM WATER over the yeast. Stir well, and let stand to
dissolve. Heat the milk, stirring, to the same temperature as the
yeast, then pour it over the dissolved yeast. Add the butter (or
shortening or oil), sugar, salt and 4 cups of the flour. Beat
vigorously with a large spoon for at least 1 minute. Stir in enough
of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff but not
dry dough. Dust the kneading surface with 1/4 cup of the reserved
flour and turn the dough out onto it, cleaning the bowl completely
with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for 1 minute, sprinkling extra
flour a little at a time as necessary, then let rest for 10 minutes.
Resume kneading for about 6 to 8 minutes more, or until the dough is
smooth and elastic. Put in a lightly greased bowl, cover and let rest
in a warm place to rise for between 1 and 2 hours. When the dough has
doubled in bulk, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and punch
it down for a minute. Cut dough in half and pat each half into an
oval the approximate length of your bread pan, which should be
lightly greased. Put in the pan, cover with a damp towel and let rise
for another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350F and, when
the bread is risen, put it in the oven. Bake for about 40-to-45
minutes in a glass pan, or 45-to-50 minutes in a metal pan. Makes 2
