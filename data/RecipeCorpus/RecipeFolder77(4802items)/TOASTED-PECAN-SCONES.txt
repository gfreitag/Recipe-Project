4 c  All-purpose flour
4 ts Double-acting baking powder

In a food processor, process the flour, the baking powder, the sugar,
and the butter until the mixture just resembles coarse meal. In a
small bowl whisk together the eggs and the milk, add the mixture to
the processor, and blend the dough, pulsing the motor, until it is
just combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead in
the pecans. Roll or pat the dough 1/2 inch thick, with a 2" cutter
cut out rounds, and transfer them to a greased baking sheet. Bake the
rounds in the middle of a preheated 425 degree oven for 14 minutes,
or until they are pale golden. Makes 30 scones.
