Title: ZUPPA DI ASPARAGI (CALABRIAN ASPARAGUS SOUP)
Categories: Soups, Vegetarian, Italian
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Garlic clove; minced
2 tb Olive oil; extra-virgin
2 lb Asparagus; trimmed & cut
-into 1" pieces
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper, black
4 c  Vegetable broth; OR
4 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Parmesan; grated, plus extra
-for serving
6 sl Italian bread; toasted
In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate
heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the
asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add the salt,
pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to
moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15
minutes.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the
heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly
ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking
constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into
the soup in the saucepan. Increase the heat to moderately low and
cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8
minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle.
Remove from the heat.

Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot
soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.

Note:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
day-old or slightly stale bread. Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.
