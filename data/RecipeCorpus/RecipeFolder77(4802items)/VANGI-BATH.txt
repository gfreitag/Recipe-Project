Title: VANGI BATH
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Eggplant
Coriander seeds
Hing
3    Dried red chilli
Urad dal
Turmeric
Cinnamon sticks
Basmati rice, cooked
Coconut, flaked
1 lg Lemon
Cook the rice. The usual way - but to get it dry, fluffy and light
(not at all sticky).

Skin the eggplant and chop it into cubes; sprinkle lemon juice on the
cubes (+ some salt) and let sit for
30    minutes or so.

In a large saucepan, heat some oil and when hot, toss the spices in
and fry for 2-3 minutes. When the color has changed to dark, use a
slotted spoon and toss the contents into a plate lined with a paper
napkin (this will drain out the oil sticking to the spices).

Add some oil to the pan and when hot, toss the coconut in and keep
stirring until the coconut becomes brown/golden. Remove in a manner
similar to the spices.

To the pan, add some oil and when hot, add the soaked eggplant cubes
and stir until about 3/4 cooked. Remove the eggplant and keep in a
warm container.

In a blender (or coffee grinder), blend the spices and coconut until
you have a powder.

In a pot, boil one-quarter cup water, lotsa lemon juice, 1/2 tsp
turmeric and some salt.

Into the cooked rice, toss the contents of the pot and stir. The rice
should take on the color of the turmeric.

Now, add the contents of the blender. The rice should take the color
of the spice-mix and here and there, you can see a glimpse of the
yellow turmeric color.

Squeeze lemon onto the eggplant; let sit for 1-2 minutes; toss the
eggplant into the rice and stir.

Taste a bit; if you need salt, add. If you feel something is missing,
squeeze some lemon, stir and repeat. (You may choose to add some salt
that way too) Vangi bath is ready. Serve with yogurt raita/pachadi.
