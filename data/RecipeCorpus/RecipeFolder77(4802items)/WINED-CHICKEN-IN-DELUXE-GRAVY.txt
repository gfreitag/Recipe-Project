Categories: Chicken, Oriental, Poultry, Meats, Wok
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Fryer (3-4 pound in weight)
1 lg Onion, cut into wedges
1 c  Fresh mushrooms, sliced
-OR
1/2 c  Canned mushrooms
1/2 c  Celery, sliced
-OR
1    Celery stalk, sliced
1/2 c  Water chestnuts, sliced
4 tb Oil
1/4 c  Soya sauce
1/4 c  Wine
1 1/2 tb Corn starch, dissolved in
1/3 c  Water
1. Take your Chinese cleaver and chop through bone of chicken to form
chunks of chicken, about 2x2". Marinate all chicken chunks in wine,
soya sauce, salt for at least 20 minutes. In the meantime, slice all
the other ingredients and have ready for cooking.

2. If your wok is small, you will have to divide your chicken into 2
batches and cook each batch seperately. If your wok is large enough
to hold all the chicken, then place 4 tablespoons oil in it, heat to
smoking point, add all of the chicken and onions to it, stir fry and
brown chicken on all sides with wok uncovered. This will take about
10 minutes. At the end of this period, cover wok and cook chicken a
further 10 minutes.

3. Uncover wok, add clery, mushrooms, water chestnuts, stir everything
well. Cover wok and cook ingredients 3 minutes, uncovering wok, once
to give things a stir. Mix starch solution up well, add to wok, stir
everything up thoroughly.

NOTE: If your wok is small, cook the chicken in two batches. Remove
both batches of chicken to a serving platter. Leave chicken juices in
wok. Cook vegetables and make gravy in it. When vegetables and gravy
are cooked, pour over chicken. This dish can be used as a main dish
in Canadian cuisine, by not cutting up the chicken so fine.
