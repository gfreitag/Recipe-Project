Title: YELLOW WATERMELON SOUP
Categories: Appetizers, Soups & ste
Yield: 6 Servings
7 1/2 lb Watermelon -- yellow-flesh,
Chill
1 c  Raspberries -- chilled
Garnish options--
3 oz Prosciutto -- thinly sliced
1 bn Thompson seedless grapes --
Red or green, halved
1/4 c  Fresh mint leaves -- minced
1/4 c  Carrot -- finely shredded
Orange zest -- long strands
Cut watermelon into pieces. Trim off rind; discard. Discard seeds. In
batches, puree watermelon flesh in a blender or food processor or by
hand [1].  Pour into a bowl and set aside in the refrigerator to
chill. [2]

Rinse berries, drain, then puree in a blender or processor. Rub puree
through a strainer to collect and discard seeds. [2]

Optional:  Cut prosciutto into very thin shreds. Place shreds in a
10-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until
prosciutto is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper
towels until cool.

ASSEMBLY -  Pour melon puree equally into 6 or 4 bowls. With a small
spoon, dollop raspberry puree in a circle, spacing drops well apart
and adding equally small amount to each portion. With the tip of a
skewer or small knife, pull through the raspberry dots, drawing them
out into swirls through yellow puree. Sprinkle with prosciutto and
mint [3] or one-or-more of the other meatless garnishes. (Can serve
8.)

[1] The round, seedless watermelon is first available late-April.
These and other nearly 100%-water melons liquify when processed. Test
first: crush by hand. If the strands start to disintegrate, mash by
hand. The soup needs some body. [2] May be chilled up to 1 day in
advance. [3] Use a fresh herb to splash the soup with some green.
(I've used cilantro and red seedless grapes.)
