Title: TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE
Categories: Pasta, Casseroles
Yield: 8 Servings
8 oz Egg noodles
1 pk Frozen peas (10 oz)
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup (8oz)
1 c  Milk
1 cn Tuna,drained (12 1/2 oz)
1/2 c  Plain or seasoned bread
-crumbs tossed with
3 tb Melted butter
-or
1/2 c  Crushed Ritz crackers
-tossed with
3 tb Melted butter or margarine
Heat the oven to 375'F. with the rack in the center position. Grease
or spray non-stick vegetable cooking spray on 1 medium to large
ovenproof baking dish, or two smaller dishes.

Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, but
shorten the cooking time by 2 minutes. Drain the noodles and combine
with the peas, soup and milk. Mash the tuna with a fork to break it
up and add it to the noodles. Mix gently and spoon into prepared pan.
Sprinkle the crumbs over the top and bake for 35 minutes, until hot.

Variations: Add salt (taste first, as soup may be salted enough);
freshly grated black pepper; white pepper; snipped fresh herbs, such
as tarragon, or dried herbs. Also, if you're not an avid fan of bread
crumbs, 2 cups may be too much. Toss 1/2 to 3/4 cups with 1
tablespoon melted butter or margarine for a light sprinkling.
