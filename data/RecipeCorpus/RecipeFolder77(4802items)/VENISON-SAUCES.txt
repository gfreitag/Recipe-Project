Title: VENISON SAUCES
Categories: Ethnic, Meats, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 lb Sugar
1/2 pt Champagne vinegar
Sweet Sauce:
6 oz White or red currant jelly
6 oz White or red wine
Sharp Sauce:

Sharp Sauce:--A quarter-pound of the best loaf-sugar, or white
candy-sugar, dissolved in a half-pint of Champagne vinegar, and
carefully skimmed.

Sweet Sauce:--Melt some white or red currant jelly with a glass of
white or red wine, whichever suits best in color; or serve jelly
unmelted in a small sweetmeat-glass.  This sauce answers well for
hare, fawn, or kid, and for roast mutton to many tastes.

Gravy for Venison:--Make a pint of gravy of trimmings of venison or
shanks of mutton thus:  broil the meat on a quick fire till it is
browned, then stew it slowly. Skim, strain, and serve the gravy it
yields, adding salt and a teaspoonful of walnut pickle.
