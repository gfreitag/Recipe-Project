Title: WESLEY'S CHILI PIZZA  V 4.0
Categories: Main dish, Pizza, Original
Yield: 1 14" pizza
1 ea Basic pizza dough *
2 c  Chili **
6 oz Mild Longhorn Cheddar cheese
(grated)
1/4 c  Onion (very thinly sliced)
1/2 ea Green Bell pepper (chopped)
1 oz Ripe black olives, sliced
1/2 lb Pork sausage
9 ea Medium-sized mushrooms,
Sliced
*   Pizza dough is very subjective.  I won't attempt a recipe here,
just make your favorite dough for 1 large pizza.

**  NO BEANS IN THE CHILI!  If you must use canned, I recommend a 15
oz. can of Wolf Brand Chili.  This will work very nicely.

Directions:

1.  Saute the sausage, mushrooms (stems and caps), and Bell pepper
until very lightly browned.

2.  Preheat oven to 500 deg F.

3.  Roll pizza dough into a pizza-like shape, and add toppings in
this order:

Chili
Sausage, 'shrooms, and peppers
Olives
Onions
Cheese

you don't have one, get one!
