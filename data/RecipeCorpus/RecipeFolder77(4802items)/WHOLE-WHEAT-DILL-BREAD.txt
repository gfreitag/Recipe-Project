Title: WHOLE WHEAT DILL BREAD
Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
-JUDY GARNETT   (PJXG05A)
1 pk Yeast; - or 2 1/2 tsp.
2 c  Whole wheat bread flour
1 1/3 c  White bread flour
1 tb Gluten
1 tb Lecithin granules
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Salt; - (I use Light Salt)
1/2    Ctn  eggbeaters ;-
-or one egg - AT ROOM TEMP.
1/4 c  -water
3/4 c  Non-fat Cottage Cheese
3/4 c  Plain Non-Fat Yogurt
3 tb Sugar
3 tb Onion; minced dried
2 tb Whole dill SEED
1 1/2 tb Olive oil; - or butter
Warm together the water; cottage cheese, yogurt, sugar, onion, dill
seed and oil in microwave for about 30 seconds or until warm to the
touch (about 110 deg). Set aside. Place all other ingredients above
into the bread pan in order listed. Add warmed ingredients. Select
white bread setting (other brands of B/M's may have a whole wheat
setting), but the white bread setting works on the DAK. Set
light/dark setting on side of B/M to 11 o'clock. Press Start. Open
lid after dough has kneaded about 2 mins. Press dough lightly with
fingertip. If wet, sticky dough adheres to your fingertip OR dough is
not forming into one soft ball (NO sticky dough on bottom of pan),
add 1 Tablespoon or more flour until dough is just slightly tacky and
makes one soft ball of dough. Judy Garnett --- Hope this does well
for you. I use my elec. knife to slice the bread top to bottom down
the center first. Then place the two cut sides down and slice them
thin. This makes a great sandwich bread or is good toasted with a
little diet margarine spread.  Best regards, Judy Garnett 11/07 11:18
