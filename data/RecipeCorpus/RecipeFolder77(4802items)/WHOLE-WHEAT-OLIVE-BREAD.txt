Title: WHOLE WHEAT OLIVE BREAD
Categories: Bakery
1/4 c  olive oil
Yield: 16 Servings
1 c  finely chopped onion
2 pk active dry yeast
1 1/4 c  warm water -- (105 to 115
degrees)
:
1 ts honey
1 ts salt
1 c  black olives -- coarsely
chopped
(Greek or Spanish)
:
:
2 TB fresh thyme -- finely
chopped
:
2 1/2 c  whole wheat flour
1 1/2 c  bread flour -- (1-1/2 to 2)

In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil, add the onions, and cook
until soft, 4 or 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.

Dissolve the yeast in the water with the honey. In a medium mixing
bowl, combine the yeast mixture, onion mixture, salt, olives, and
thyme and stir well. Add the whole wheat flourand stir to combine
well. Add enough of the bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a
stiff dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth
and elastic, adding flour as necessary. Place in an oiled bowl, cover
with plastic wrap or in a plastic bag, and set aside to rise until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch down and divide the dough in half. Shape into 2 round loaves,
flatten them slightly, and place them on an oiled baking sheet. Set
aside to rise again until doubled.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake 35 to 45 minutes, or until well
browned and the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on
racks.

Yield: 2 small loaves
