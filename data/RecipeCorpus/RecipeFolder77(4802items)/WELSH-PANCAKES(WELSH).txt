Categories: Pancakes, Welsh
Yield: 4 Servings
Batter :
4 oz Flour
Sugar and lemon
1    Egg
Pinch of salt
1/2 pt Milk and water
Lard for frying
(CREMPOG CYMRU (FFROIS CYMRU)) Sift the flour and salt together. Make
a hole in the centre of the flour and add the egg. Add 2 table-
spoonsful of liquid and stir until all the ingredients are mixed well
together and there are no lumps. Add half the remaining liquid and
beat until the batter is smooth. Stir in the rest of the liquid. Heat
a little lard in a frying pan until it begins to 'haze'. Pour just
enough batter into the pan to cover the bottom. Fry, using a moderate
heat, shaking the pan gently so that the pancake does not stick to
the pan. Turn and cook the other side. Turn on to a plate and
sprinkle witil sugar. Roll up and place under a low grill to keep
warm.
