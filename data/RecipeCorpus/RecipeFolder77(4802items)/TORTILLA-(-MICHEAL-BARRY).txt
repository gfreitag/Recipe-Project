Chop the cooked meat or fish or sausage you are adding into small
pieces. Peel and slice the onions.

Heat the oil in a big frying pan and gently fry the onions until they
just begin to turn golden.

Add the sliced potatoes, then the frozen vegetables, stir and let it
cook for a minute while you beat the eggs until just frothy and then
add them to the pan.

Mix it all together gently and cook over a medium to high heat for
two to three minutes.

Now add the goodies from the fridge, meat or fish or sausage and the
fresh or dried herbs.

The egg should now be firm and everything else hot through.

Put the pan under a hot grill for one or two minutes until the top of
the omelette is brown and bubbly.

Serve in slices like a cake directly from the pan.
