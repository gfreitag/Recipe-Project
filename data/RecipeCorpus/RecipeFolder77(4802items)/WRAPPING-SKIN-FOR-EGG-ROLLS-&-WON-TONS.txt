Title: WRAPPING SKIN FOR EGG ROLLS & WON TONS
Categories: China, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg
1/2 c  Water
Sift flour and salt together Beat egg, add water and mix well.

Blend thoroughly with flour and salt; knead until dough is smooth.
Roll dough on floured board until paper thin. Be sure board is well
dusted with flour.

For egg rolls, makes about 18 6" square wrappings. If won ton
wrappings are desired, cut each 6" square into four pieces. (if
wrappings are not to be used immediately, they may be stacked
together, but each piece should be well floured). Wrap stack in
aluminum foil, and place in refrigerator. This will keep about a
week. If skins become too hard and dry, place a wet dishcloth around
them to moisten. Serves 4.
