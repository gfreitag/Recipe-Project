Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat a skillet over medium-high to
high heat, add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, and saute the chicken
until it is turning golden brown on both sides. Turn the heat to low,
add the wine, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through,
about 3 to 5 minutes or more, depending on the thickness of the
chicken. Remove the pan from the heat and when the chicken is cool
enough to handle, shred it, reserving the pan juices.

Heat a saucepan over medium heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons
olive oil, and saute the onions until they are just golden brown,
being careful not to scorch them. Add the garlic and continue cooking
for 1 minute. Add the chiles, reserved pan juices from the chicken,
and the tomatoes. Cook until the chiles are soft and the sauce has
begun to thicken, about 5 minutes or more depending on the water
content of the tomatoes. Then, add the salt, remove the pan from the
heat, and stir in the shredded chicken.

Pour 1/2 inch cooking oil into a skillet just large enough to
accommodate the tortillas. Heat the oil until a drop of water
sputters immediately One at a time, using kitchen tongs, dip the
tortillas into the beaten egg, drain well, and fry to soften the
tortillas and cook the egg, turning once. This should take just a be
seconds on each side. The tortillas will be very soft so be careful
not to tear them. Drain the fried tortillas on absorbent towels.

To assemble the tortas, place one cooked tortilla on each of 4
ovenproof serving plates.  Top each tortilla with a little of the
chicken /vegetable filling, then sprinkle on some cheese. Add the
second and third tortilla and fillings in the same manner so that the
third tortilla is topped with the remaining chicken/vegetable filling
and cheese. Bake the tortas until the cheese is melted and turning
golden on the top, about 8 minutes. Serve garnished with shredded
lettuce and chopped tomato. Typos by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@aol.com>
