Parkin is a variety of gingerbread, good warming stuff to eat out of
doors in cold weather. When I was a child, it was always a firm
favourite for the firework party on Bonfire Night each year. This is
adapted from my mother's recipe.

Method:

Prepare 2 1-lb loaf tins, or an 9x9 inch square tin, by spraying with
Pam. Set the oven at 350 deg F (gas mark 4).

In a large bowl, mix together the oatmeal, flour, baking powder,
ginger, and salt. In a small bowl or saucepan, mix together the apple
sauce, sugar, treacle, syrup, and milk, and warm slightly to dissolve
the sugar. Add these to the oatmeal mixture along with the egg white,
and mix together to make a soft mixture of a slow-pouring
consistency, adding extra milk if necessary. Bake for 40-50 minutes,
or until the top springs back when pressed lightly with a finger.

After it has cooled a bit, but before it gets cold, cut it into 2-inch
squares in the tin. Cool the pieces on a wire rack, and store them in
an airtight container.

It tastes better if it is stored for 2-3 days before eating.
