2 c  Water
1 c  Cracked quadrotriticale**
1    Cucumber; medium
6    Green onions
2    Tomatoes
1/2 c  Parsley; finely chopped
12    Fresh mint leaves  OR
1/2    Green pepper; chopped
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
4 tb Lemon juice  OR
3 tb Wine Vinegar
1/3 c  Olive oil
**bulgur cracked wheat may be substituted.
Bring 2 cups water to a boil in the saucepan and slowly pour in the
quadrotriticale (or bulgur) so that the water keeps on boiling.
Reduce the heat and simmer with the lid on for about 10 minutes, or
until the water is all absorbed. Then take off the lid and cook for a
few minutes more, stirring constantly, to dry it out a bit. Spread it
on the sides and bottom of a large salad bowl so it can cool more
quickly and put it in the refrigerator to chill it.
Meanwhile peel and dice the cucumber, discarding the seeded center
part if it is not firm. Clean and slice the green onions into 1/8"
pieces, including abut 3" of the green tops. Cut the core out of the
tomatoes and cut them into 1/2" chunks. Wash and chop the parsley.
Chop the mint or the pepper, if you are using one of them.
When the wheat is cool, break it up with a fork until it is loose
and there are no chunks more than 1/2" in size. Add the vegetables to
it and mix, then add the salt and pepper, lemon juice (or vinegar),
and the olive oil. Mix again thoroughly.
Note: It is traditional to add mint or green pepper to only a part
of the salad when the host is not sure of all his guests' preferences.
