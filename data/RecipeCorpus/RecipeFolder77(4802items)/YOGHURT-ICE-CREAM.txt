Title: YOGHURT ICE CREAM
Categories: Desserts, Barry
Yield: 6 Servings
10 fl Whole-milk plain yoghurt
4 oz Your favourite fruit
Sugar to taste
Dissolve a little sugar in water in a saucepan and add the fruit.
Simmer for 5 minutes until soft and then puree through a sieve. If
you have a food processor or liquidiser don't cook the fruit - just
whizz it to a puree, adding sugar, a teaspoon at a time, until it is
to your taste. Beat the puree into the yoghurt, pour into a plastic
container and put it in the freezer.

When it has set, take it out, spoon it back into the the food
processor or liquidiser and give it a quick whizz. This gets rid of
any little particles of ice that may have formed. If you don't have a
machine, spoon the mixture into a bowl and whisk it thoroughly. Pour
it back into the plastic container and freeze again.

When you're ready to eat it, leave it in the fridge for half an hour
before serving.
