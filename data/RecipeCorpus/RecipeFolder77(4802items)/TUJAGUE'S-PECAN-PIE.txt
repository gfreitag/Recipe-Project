(Introduction by Malcolm Hébert)

When the French settled in New Orleans they discovered the pecan. And
they promptly made good use of it by creating pecan brittle, pecan
pralines, pecan sauce and of course pecan pie. The first pecans I
ever ate came from my Grandmother's pecan tree in her backyard. Every
Christmas she would send a 50 pound gunny sack of pecans to my
mother. My Grandmother's pecans were not those tasteless thin shelled
kind; hers had thick shells with just as much shell as meat and 10
times more taste.

This recipe for pecan pie is from my mother's uncle whose family owned
Tujague's restaurant in New Orleans for more than 70 years.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a glass mixing bowl beat the eggs,
blending in the sugar, syrup, butter, vanilla, salt, Armagnac and
pecans. Pour the mixture into the pie shell and bake 10 minutes.
Lower the oven to 350 degrees and bake 30 minutes or until a wooden
skewer or knife inserted into the pie comes out clean. Cool on a wire
rack. Serves 6-8. Walt MM
