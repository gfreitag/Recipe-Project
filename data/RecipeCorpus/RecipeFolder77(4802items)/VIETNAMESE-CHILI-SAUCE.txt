Title: VIETNAMESE CHILI SAUCE
Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Dried Red Chiles
2    Cloves Garlic
1/2 ts Sugar
2 tb Nam Pla (Fish Sauce)
1 tb Vinegar
1 tb Lemon Juice
Mince the chiles and garlic finely and place in a mortar. Mash with
the heal of a cleaver or pestle. Add sugar and stir until it
dissolves. Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between
each addition. This makes enough for 2-4 people. It is wise to make
double just to make sure there is enough. It can be frozen and will
last for a few days in the refrigerator but will lose its kick in a
short time. This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip with chicken
or whatever. Variations of this are found in cambodia, Thailand and
other Southeast Asian countries. You can fiddle with it endlessly.
This is a good starting point. The proportions shown here produce
what might be considered a mildly warm dip. Add more chiles for a
higher degree of "HOT". Variations: Use green Serrano chiles instead
of dried red ones, lime juice instead of lemon juice or palm sugar
instead of granulated. If you make it in a food processor, don't over
process. There should be small chunks of the ingredients in the
sauce. The taste is sour and hot, very puckery. It's great with
poached or steamed chicken, duck or game hens. Much better with bland
dishes rather than something like curry, which has it's own blend of
spices. Fish Sauce or Nam Pla in Thailand is a liquid made with
anchovies and salt. It's not really fishy tasting. Look for it in the
oriental section of the supermarket or at markets catering to Asian
customers. Tiparos is a good brand made in the Phillipines. Thai or
Vietnamese fish sauce are prefered, but may be more difficult to
find. Chinese Fish Sauce is not suitable. If you want the flavor and
not the incendiary quality, seed the chiles before adding them.
