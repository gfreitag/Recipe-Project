1. Skin and bone chicken.  Cut into 2" x 1/2" pieces.

for 1 hour.

3. Heat 2 cups oil to 325 degrees and deep-fry cashew nuts for 5
minutes, drain and salt lightly.

4. Boil Chinese mushrooms for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off
and discard stems.  If you use canned mushrooms, omit this step.

5. Cut celery into 1 1/2" pieces, then cut each piece lengthwise into
strips, julienne style.

6. Cut bamboo shoot tips into thin slices.

7. Peel water chestnuts (using potato peeler) and cut a little off
the top and the bottom of each one.  Then cut them into thin slices
and soak in water to prevent them from turning dark. (Canned water
chestnuts are already peeled.)

8. Heat wok, add 1 t. oil and stir-fry the bamboo tips and water
chestnuts together, if you use fresh water chestnuts. (If canned ones
are used, stir-fry them separately in 1 teaspoon oil for 1-2 minutes,
adding 2 teaspoons sugar.)  Set aside.

yellow onion for 3 minutes, with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon

for 3 minutes.  Add chicken stock, cover and cook for 10 minutes over
medium heat.

12. Thicken with a mixture made with the cornstarch and 2 tablespoon
cold water.  Bring to a boil, cook for 1 minute and turn off the heat.

13. Add cashew nuts, mix thoroughly, and serve.

Serve alone, or with rice.
