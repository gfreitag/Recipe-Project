Title: YOGURT-CURRY CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Chicken breasts -- skinned &
Boned
1 c  Plain yogurt
5    Cloves garlic -- minced
1 lg Onion -- chopped
3/4 ts Salt
2 tb Curry powder
2 tb Lime juice
Combine all the marinade ingredients with the chicken and refrigerate
all day or overnight... the longer the best.=20

When you're ready to cook it, bake it at 400 with all the sauce for
35-40 minutes, so the chicken is done, any germs are cooked to death,
and the sauce starts to reduce.=20
