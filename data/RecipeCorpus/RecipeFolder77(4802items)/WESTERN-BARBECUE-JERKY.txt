Title: WESTERN BARBECUE JERKY
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Salt
3 tb Brown sugar
1/4 ts Pepper
1/3 c  Red wine vinegar
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
1/3 c  Ketchup
1 ts Onion powder
1 lb Lean meat
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Dry mustard
Slice meat into long strips 3/16 to 1/4 inch thick. Uniform slices
will shorten the drying time, so use a meat slicer or have your
butcher slice it for you. Cut across the grain for increased
tenderness. Remove excess fat. In a small bowl, combine all
ingredients except meat. Stir to mix well. Place meat 3 or 4 layers
deep in a glass, stoneware, plastic or stainless steel container,
spooning vinegar mixture over each layer. Cover tightly. Marinate 6
to 12 hours in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally and keeping
the mixture tightly covered. Place the meat strips on drying racks.
Do not overlap the strips to ensure good air circulation. Oven
temperature should be 140 to 160 F (60 to 70 C) for the first 8 to 10
hours. After that it may be lowered to 130 F (55C) until dry. Place
aluminum foil or a baking sheet underneath the drying tray to catch
the drippings. Occasionally blot the jerky with paper towels as it
dries to remove beads of oil. Test jerky for dryness by cooling a
piece. When cool it should crack when bent but not break. There
should be no moist spots.
