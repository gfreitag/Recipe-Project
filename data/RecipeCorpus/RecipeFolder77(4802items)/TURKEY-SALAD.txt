Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM--------------------VINAIGRETTE DRESSING-------------------------
1 ts Orange peel, grated
2 tb Orange juice
1 tb Rice vinegar
1 tb White wine vinegar
2 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Mustard, Dijon
1/4 c  Oil, peanut

MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
6 c  Turkey, cooked; shredded
1 bn Watercress
2    Celery stalks
1/2    Cucumbers; peeled & seeded
4    Green onions
Trim green onions of roots and all but 3" of green. Cut celery,
cucumber, and green onions into 2-1/2" matchstick strips.

Make vinaigrette dressing: combine orange peel, orange juice,
vinegars, soy sauce, and mustard in bowl; whisk well. Slowly drizzle
in peanut and sesame oil, whisking constantly until dressing is
slightly thick.

In bowl, toss turkey with black pepper and 1/3 c dressing. Use more
dressing if desired.  Reserve remaining dressing for another use.

To serve, arrange watercress on platter.  Spoon dressed turkey onto
center. Arrange celerly, cucumber, and green onions decoratively over
turkey.

After heavy holiday meals, the freshness of this salad is a welcome
treat. Matchstick strips of crisp celery, cucumbers, and scallions
are easy enough to prepare with a sharp knife, and the results are
elegant and decorative when arranged atop the dressed turkey.
