A great chili relies on a sophisticated blend of seasonings. This one
uses both fresh chilies and dried chili powder along with a spark of
garlic, cilantro and fresh lemon juice.

Dredge the veal in flour seasoned with salt and pepper and brown on
all sides in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Set aside.

Add the, remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and soften the onion,
2 garlic cloves and the chile pepper in it.

Add the chili powder, cumin bay leaf basil thyme oregano and flour;
cook 2 minutes. Add the reserved meat and toss well in the spices.

Deglaze the pan with the wine and boil until alcohol evapo- rates.

Add the chicken stock and tomatoes. Simmer, partially cov- ered, for 1
hour, or until the veal is tender.

Add the artichoke hearts and chick-peas and simmer 10 minutes longer.

Remove pan from heat and stir in the lemon juice, cilantro and
remaining minced garlic. PER SERVING: 545 calories, 59 g protein, 42
