Title: WEST INDIAN MASALA
Categories: Spice mix
Yield: 1 /2 cup
6 tb Coriander seeds
1 ts Fenugreek seeds
2 ts Fennel seeds
1 ts Black mustard seeds
1 1/2 ts Cumin seeds
2 ts Turmeric (opt)
1 ts Ground Jamaican allspice
-(optional)
Roast all the seeds in a large pan in a 350Ã¸F oven until they begin
popping. Place a cookie sheet on top of the pan and roast for an
additional 8 minutes, taking care not to burn the seeds. Cool the
seeds and grind them together in a spice mill to a fine powder. Add
the turmeric and allspice, if using, and mix well.

The lack of chilies is typical of the eastern Caribbean where hot
sauces rather than curry powder is expected to provide the heat.
