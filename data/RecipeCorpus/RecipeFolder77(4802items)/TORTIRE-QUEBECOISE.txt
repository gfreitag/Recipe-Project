Categories: Pork, Beef, Meats, Pies
Yield: 1 Tortire
1/2 lb Pork - lean
1/2 lb Beef - lean
1/2 lb Veal
1/2 lb Chicken
1/4 lb Salt pork fat
Salt
Pepper
1    Onion
2 1/2 lb Potatoes
1    Thick pie shell
MMMMM------------------------SUET PASTRY-----------------------------
1/2 lb Suet, finely minced
4 c  All purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/3 c  Water (approx)
At night prepare the meat by cutting the pork, veal, beef, chicken
and pork fat into small cubes. Season with salt, pepper and onion cut
in rings. Cover and put in a cool, fresh place. The next morning, cut
the potatoes in small cubes. Roll suet pastry into a 28xd4x1/2-inch
strip. Cut lengthwise into halves. Line a 10-inch three-quart
casserole (or two smaller casseroles) with one strip, bringing pastry
over top edge. fill pastry with alternate layers of meat and potatoes
until all ingredients are used. Cover all with boiling water and seal
pie with top layer of pie shell. Cut hole in centre of pie shell to
let steam escape. Cover casserole with foil. Bake in moderate oven
(350F) for four hours. Remove the foil for the last 30 minutes of
baking time to brown the crust. The original recipe of the Naskapis
(native Indians of Quebec) called for one rabbit, a partridge, one
pound of moose meat and one pound of lean pork instead of the more
mundane meats used today. Variation: Minced meats may be used in lieu
of cubes. Suet pastry: Mix suet with flour, baking powder and salt.
Stir in enough water to moisten the flour. Gather dough together and
shape into a ball.
