Title: VERANECKI (PILLOWS)
Categories: Russian, Dumplings, Cheese, Cottage, Noodles
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Flour
3/4 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2    8 oz. glasses COLD water
1 lb Dry cottage cheese sm curd
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg
Add enough water to make a soft noodle like dough. Knead until well
mixed. Divide dough into 2 balls. Set one aside. Roll into large
circle about 1/8/ inch thick. Cut into 3 inch squares. Fill with the
following.

Mix together well.

When filling "Pillows", make sure you place 1 tsp of cottage cheese
mixture in dead center of dough square being VERY careful you don't
get any cheese on the edge. You'll NEVER get the little suckers to
seal!!! Any way, they should come out looking like little pillows.
Pinch edges closed with your fingers. Another tip...don't roll the
dough out TOO thin or else you will get lot's of leaks.

Boil pillow in large kettle to which a tsp of salt has been added. It
would be a good idea to not cook more than 5 or 6 at a time lest they
stick together on the kettle. The pillows will be done when they rise
to the top and puff up.  They also take on a yellowish cast (about 7
mins. per batch). Remove from pot with a slotted spoon very
carefully!!! Place them in a bowl with a stick of butter (don't even
attempt this recipe if you try to use low fat healthy junk!!!). Serve
hot with salt and pepper to taste.

Another variation is to fill with black cherries. Cook and butter as
with the cottage cheese pillows. Sprinkle with granulated sugar.
