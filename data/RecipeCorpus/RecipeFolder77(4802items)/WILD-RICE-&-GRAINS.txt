If wild rice is unavailable, use brown rice instead. Rinse the rice
thoroughly in a colander and let drain. In a large heavy saucepan or
skillet with a lid, melt 3 tbsp of the butter. Add onion and cook
over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Add rice and
toss to coat with butter. Stir in 3 cups water and the salt. Bring to
a simmer, cover tightly, and cook over low heat, stirring
occasionally, for 45 to 50 minutes, or until rice is tender and all
water is absorbed.If water is absorbed before rice is tender, add a
few tablespoons more and continue cooking. Melt the remaining tbsp
butter in a medium skillet. Add green and purple grapes and toss in
the butter until heated through. Add grape mixture and parsley to the
cooked wild rice, season with pepper, and toss to mix thoroughly. Add
additional salt if necessary. Serve hot.
