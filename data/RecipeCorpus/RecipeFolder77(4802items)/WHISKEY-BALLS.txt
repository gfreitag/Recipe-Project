Title: WHISKEY BALLS
Categories: Desserts, Candies, Alcohol
Yield: 36 Servings
3 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
1/2 c  Finely chopped pecans
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 c  Confectioner's sugar
1/2 c  Bourbon
3 tb Light corn syrup
Salt, if desired
1.  Blend together the crumbs, nuts, cocoa, 1 cup confectioner's
sugar, Bourbon, corn syrup, and a dash of salt. Form into small
balls the size of walnuts.

2.  Roll each ball in the remaining 1 cup confectioner's sugar and
place on a cookie sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for several
hours or overnight.

Note:  It is traditional in the South to use Bourbon, but rye may
also be used. This confection -- or at least a version of it
~- was an early Southern version of those chocolate truffles that
became the rage for chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this
country. The whiskey balls are made, of course, with cocoa rather
than chocolate.
