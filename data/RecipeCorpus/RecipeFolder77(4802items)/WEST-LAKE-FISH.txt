Title: WEST LAKE FISH
Categories: Chinese, Fish, Loo
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Fresh-water bass *
1 tb Dry sherry or rice wine
4    Ginger slices
Lots of water, boiling
-in a kettle
4 tb Sugar
6 tb Chekiang vinegar **
1 tb Soy sauce
1/4 oz Knob ginger
Juice of 1 garlic,mashed
2 tb Cornstarch
(sweet-sour Hangchow dish, adapted from Joyce Chen's restaurant)

* other fresh-water fish may be substituted; a small striper may be
substituted in a pinch; look for 15-18" (1 1/2 to 2 lb) fish,
preferably one you caught yourself. You could also probably use 2 or
3 bluegills

** substitute cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, or possibly balsamic

Clean, gut, scale, and rinse fish. Cut through skin three diagonal
cuts on each side like so /// .

Put fish, sherry, and ginger slices into kettle of boiling water.
Water should cover the fish. Cover tightly and immediately turn off
heat. Let stand 15 min.

Meanwhile, mix all the rest of the ingredients and cook over
medium-high heat until sauce thickens. Remove garlic if used. Keep
very hot.

Remove fish carefully from water. Drain and gently pat dry. Pour
boiling sauce over and serve immediately.

Variation: cut sugar to 1 T; cut vinegar to 2 T. Increase soy sauce
to 3 T; add 2 T dry sherry to sauce ingredients; add 2 T chicken
broth to sauce ingredients. This obviously is no longer West Lake
fish but a more standard soy sauce fish.
