Vegetable Frittata:

Packed with vegetables, this puffy frittata makes a comforting
meatless supper on a cold winter night.

Peel sweet potato; cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Place in steamer basket
over boiling water; cook, covered, for 5 minutes. Add broccoli; cook,
covered for 4 minutes or until potato is tender and broccoli is
tender-crisp; set aside.

Meanwhile, in bowl, whisk together eggs, egg whites, salt and pepper;
set aside.

In 9-inch ovenproof skillet, heat oil over medium heat; cook onion,
garlic and tarragon, stirring, for about 2 minutes or until softened.

Arrange sweet potato mixture in bottom of skillet, pour egg mixture
over top. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, covered, for about 12
minutes or until bottom is golden and edges are set but centre still
jiggles slightly.

Sprinkle cheese over top; broil for 2-3 minutes or until light golden
and cheese is bubbly.
