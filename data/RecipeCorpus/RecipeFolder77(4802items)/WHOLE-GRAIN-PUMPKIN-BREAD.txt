* This recipe uses a lot of whole grains, but it will turn out
excellently if you use all-purpose flour in place of any or all of
the whole grains. Also, any of the whole grains are interchangeable
with any of the other whole grains in the recipe.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 2 loaf pans. Beat oil, brown
sugar, and molasses until well blended. Blend in egg and pumpkin.
Stir flours, brans, wheat germ, soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and
salt into mixture just until moistened.  Fold in nuts. Fill pans and
bake about 1 hour, until pick comes out clean. Cool on rack. Better
if served the day after cooking.

This bread freezes well.
