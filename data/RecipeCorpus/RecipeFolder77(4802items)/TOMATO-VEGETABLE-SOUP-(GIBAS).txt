Title: TOMATO VEGETABLE SOUP (GIBAS)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
Text free-form recipe
3 oz. sun dried tomatoes 5+ large cloves of garlic (the more the
better) a handful of fresh basil leaves or 1T. dried basil

simmer this until the tomatoes are soft and the garlic is cooked
through. Puree, adding enough of the cooking water to make the
blender run smoothly.

Add: several (I used 5) large tomatoes (about 5 cups, chopped). Peel
and seed if you are inspired to do so.
2    smallish zucchini, sliced.

Simmer until the tomatoes have become soup and the zucchini is almost
tender. Stir occasionally.

Add: 8 oz. mushrooms, sliced.

While the mushrooms are being absorbed into the soup, cook some small
pasta. I used 'mostacciolini'. When the pasta is done, put some in a
bowl and cover with soup.

If you add lots of spinach, instead of zucchini and mushrooms, this
becomes 'tomato Florentine soup'. Orzo or rice is a good addition in
that case, instead of the pasta.
