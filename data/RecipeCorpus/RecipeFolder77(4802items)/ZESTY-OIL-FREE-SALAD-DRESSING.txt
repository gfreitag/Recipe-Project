Title: ZESTY OIL FREE SALAD DRESSING
Categories: Dressings
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Evaporated skimmed milk
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
2 tb Wine or cider vinegar
1 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Chopped onion
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
*sugar or nutrasweet to
Taste -- optional
Mix together all ingredients in a jar with lid, shake and serve.
Keeps will in fridge. I like to serve this with Grape Nut Croutons. I
know, I know..it sounds gross....but tastes good. Take one cup Grape
Nuts and saute with low fat or fat free margarine substitute and
season with garlic salt, pepper and mustard about 2 or 3 minutes. Let
cool and sprinkle on salad as you would croutons.
