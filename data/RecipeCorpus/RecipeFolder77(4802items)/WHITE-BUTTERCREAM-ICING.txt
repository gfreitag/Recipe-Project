*By Henry & Henry. Only available in Wholesale Bakery Supply in 5 gal
pail. You might try substituting regular marshmallow creme. Does not
contain gum------only difference. But one reason I use this is to
make my buttercream roses crust harder. I can handle them better. We
sell this in smaller quantities in our cake supply shop. Other
reasons to use it: Makes icing softer & more "whipped creamy"
tasting. ~Takes out a little of the sweet taste too. Add in order
given: Crisco and flavors in a heavy duty mixer on low speed. Add
milk or water and confectioners' sugar. Mix on medium speed until
light and fluffy. Keep icing covered at all times. This recipe will
cover one cake mix and do decorations. Keeps unrefrigerated for 2
weeks in reasonably cool room. Keeps indefinately in fridge...Yes,
made using milk too! Milk/Water- makes no difference in taste. But
<purple> roses made using milk, don't fade to blue. ***Hand-held
mixer: Don't add all the p.sugar so you won't burn up the mixer. When
icing is nice & fluffy, THEN add the rest of the p.sugar...or enough
to get it to spreadable consistency. If mixer gets hot <set a
timer!>, turn it off for 20 minutes to cool it down or its ruined!
Chocolate Icing: Add Hershey's Cocoa <no sub> until the buttercream
icing becomes the nice rich chocolate color you want. If you want
strong chocolate taste, you must add more cocoa. Butter: Of course
icing made with butter tastes better. But it melts just setting out,
so think what it does in the bag in your warm hands! Of course, you
can substitute butter for Crisco <same amounts> or sub. half the
Crisco, making it half Crisco & half butter. When butter icing is
requested, I do it & just caution my customers that the decorations
won't be as perfect. Usually they don't mind. Dolores McCann,
