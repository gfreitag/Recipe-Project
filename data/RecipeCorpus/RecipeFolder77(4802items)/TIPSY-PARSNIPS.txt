Title: TIPSY PARSNIPS
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Butter
2    Apples
-(McIntosh or Red Delicious)
-- cored, quartered,
-- and thickly sliced
1 tb Olive oil
1    Garlic clove; crushed
12 oz Baby parsnips; halved
8 oz Pearl onions; halved
2 ts Fennel seeds
1 tb Chopped fresh sage
1 c  Vegetable stock
1 tb Whole-grain mustard
1 ts Honey
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and saute the
apples for 4 to 5 minutes, turning frequently, until golden on both
sides. Remove from the heat and set aside.

Heat the oil in a clean skillet and saute the garlic, parsnips,
onions, and fennel seeds for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Add the sage, cider or apple juice, and stock; bring to a boil,
cover, and simmer gently for 12 minutes.

Add the apples and their juices to the pan and simmer for 3 minutes
more. Strain the juices into a small saucepan and keep the parsnip
mixture warm in a serving dish. Stir the mustard and honey into the
pan, bring to a boil, and simmer rapidly or 5 minutes, or until the
liquid is reduced slightly and glossy. Pour over the vegetables,
season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve at once.
