Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE BABY DINOSAUR EGG (KH)
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Plastic egg mold
Non-stick cooking spray
1 lb White chocolate (containing
Paraffin)
Cotton candy
Candy Dinosaurs
Melt chocolate over medium heat in double boiler until evenly smooth.
Lightly coat each inside egg mold half with nonstick spray. Pour in
about 1/2 cup melted chocolate in 1/2 mold and "roll" mold around
gently so gravity makes the chocolate flow over entire inside
surface. Pour in more to thicken out any thin spots if necessary.
Repeat with other half. Refrigerate 10-15 minutes. Save 2-3
tablespoons of chocolate to seal egg. Dip each outer half in warm
water to loosen egg shell and invert it on a plate. Repeat with other
half. If you crack or break the shell, remelt and try again.

Place cotton candy nest in bottom half of egg, place candy Dinosaur
into cotton candy nest and cover with top half of shell. Seal the
seam with remaining melted chocolate, and smooth with your finger.

Your Dinosaur egg is now ready to present. Hatch the egg by rapping
the top shell with the back of a spoon to reveal the candy Baby
Dinosaur inside.
