For frying
4    Cloves garlic -- chopped
6    Eggs -- beaten

Leaving the skins on, slice the new potatoes thinly. Peel, split, and
slice onions. In a large saute pan, heat olive oil (the best you can
afford). You need a good quarter inch in your pan. Saute potatoes and
onions and garlic on a low flame until the potatoes are soft and the
onions are translucent. Remove with a slotted spoon and place the
potato mxture in a greased round cake pan, spring form pan, cast iron
skillet or terra-cotta baking dish. If you use something small, make
two. Season eggs and pour over potatoes. Bake 20 minutes at 350F and
then start testing. When the middle is set and the top slightly
brown, it's done. Let set 5 minutes, run a knife around the outside
and invert onto a round platter. Serve at room temperature.
