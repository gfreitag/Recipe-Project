(The Zeughauskeller is a big, cheerful restaurant in Zuerich which
specializes in sausages, as well as serving steak, chicken, fish, and
very good beer and Swiss wine, in an atmosphere of relaxed history
[the restaurant building used to be the town armory, and working
weapons still hang on the walls].  The following recipe is for their
potato salad. They go through twenty metric tons of it per year.)

(This recipe is an early approximation of the original recipe. All
amounts have been converted from the original metric, and reduced.) .
Salad dressing:  About 1/2 C of a good mayonnaise, the fresher the
better -- I think the Zeughauskeller makes their own fresh, every day
~- mixed to taste with German-style mustard (i.e. a sharp yellow
mustard rather than a brown one).

Every utensil must be scrupulously clean, then scalded, including
pans. ~- Peel and cut up potatoes. Cook until "almost ready", then
drain (trying to retain starch).  Put in pan.  -- Pour BOILING stock
over potatoes to bring out the starch and bind the potatoes together.
Let sit 45 minutes to absorb.  -- Chop parsley and onions (to taste)
by hand. Add to potatoes, toss;  let sit in hot mixture to add
flavor. ~- Pour salad dressing over salad:  toss.
