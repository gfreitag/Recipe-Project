It's necessary to highly season turkey because the meat itself tastes
rather mild. Yet, once ground turkey is cooked up, it's delicious. To
do a taste test on the mixture, make a little patty the size of a
silver dollar and pan-fry it in a nonstick skillet. This way you can
adjust your seasonings to taste. A mayonnaise-type dressing and
avacado make perfect toppings.

1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.

2. Place the ground turkey in a bowl and mix well with the scallions,
bell pepper, garlic, cilantro and spices. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Gently form into 4 patties.

3. Grill patties over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 5-6 minutes
per side.

4. If desired, spread buns with mayonnaise-type dressing and top
burgers with avacado slices. Serve immediately.
