Cookie Pastry: Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2
minutes.  Add egg and flour and mix until smooth dough is formed. With
hands, shape into a ball and flatten into a disc. Wrap in plastic
wrap and refrigerate until chilled.

Preheat oven to 350.

Make pastry and roll or press dough evenly over bottom and up sides of
9-inch pie pan.

Melt butter in microwave; set aside.  Whisk eggs and sugar in
medium-size bowl until blended.  Add peel and slowly stir in butter
and lemon juice until incorporated. Pour into crust. Bake for 30 to
40 minutes or until top of custard is lightly browned. It will not
test clean and will look underdone, but will set as it cools. When
cool, refrigerate. Before serving, sprinkle powdered sugar on top.
