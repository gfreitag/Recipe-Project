Title: VEGETARIAN CHILI WITH RICE (FF)
Categories: None, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
3 cn Pinto beans
1 lg Can crushed tomatoes
1 lg Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Vegetable stock
1 tb Garlic
1 tb Cumin
2    Packets achiote (annato mix
In ethnic section of
Grocery)
1 tb Parsley
2 tb Paprika
2 tb Hot sauce
Saute onions, cumin, parsley, garlic and paprika in vegetable stock in
large stock pot. Add pinto beans, tomato, and achiote and simmer for
about 1 hour. Add about 4 cups of cooked brown rice and let stand for
about 1 hour.

I usually make this in a crock pot.  Just add sauted onions and
spices to the rest of the ingredients in a crock pot and let it cook
overnight.

I add the cooked rice the next morning and leave the pot on all day.

The chili usually comes out quite runny until you add the cooked rice
and let it sit. The rice absorbes most of the moisture leaving a
thick hearty chili.

I use the Lundberg Farms rice blends especially the japonica blend
and the christmas blend.
