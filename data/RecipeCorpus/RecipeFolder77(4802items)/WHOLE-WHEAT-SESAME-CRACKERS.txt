Categories: Breads, Appetizers, Snacks, Vegetables
Yield: 72 Crackers
6 tb Sesame seeds; plus...
1/2 c  Sesame seeds
1 c  Water
3 tb Canola or safflower oil
1 ts Fine sea salt
2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 ts Nonaluminum baking powder
Surprise your family or guests with freshly baked crackers. For
special occasions, use cookie cutters to make them into imaginative
shapes. Serve them with a dip for an appetizer or pack them in a
lunch. Crackers will keep for two to three weeks stored in an
airtight container. If the crackers lose some of their crispness,
heat them at 250 F for about 5 minutes.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Position two racks in the center and the
bottom third of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350 F.

Spread 2 tablespoons sesame seeds on each of three unoiled baking
sheets. This will prevent the crackers from sticking and will give
them a delicious crisp bottom.

Put the water, oil, and salt in a small bowl until combined. Stir in
the 1/2 cup sesame seeds.  Add the water-oil mixture and mix to form
a rough dough. Knead the dough in the bowl to form a ball, and turn
out onto a lightly floured work surface.

Lightly flour a rolling pin.  Roll the dough out into a 22- by 14-inch
rectangle, about 1/16-inch thick. Using a fork, prick the dough all
over to release trapped air and keep the dough flat. With a pizza
wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares or other
shapes, or cut shapes with a 2-inch cookie cutter.

Using a spatula, transfer the crackers to the prepared baking sheets.
Bake until the crackers are light brown and firm to the touch, 15 to
20 minutes, switching the positions of the sheets halfway through the
baking time. When the first two sheets are finished, remove them, and
bake the third one as directed.  Cool completely.
