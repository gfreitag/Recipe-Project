Title: TUNA STEAK MARINADE - BSNX01A
Categories: Marinades
Yield: 1 Servings
Stuart Talkofsky
1/4 ts Hot sauce
1/2 c  Butter or Margerine --
Melted
1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1/8 c  Lemon juice
3    Garlic cloves -- crushed
Grill or Broil basting with remaining marinade. Cook fish 4 - 6
minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a
fork.

I cooked this on a stove top grill constantly basting. If cooked too
long it becomes too dry.

Meal Mastered by Stuart Talkofsky from a bag of tuna steaks.
