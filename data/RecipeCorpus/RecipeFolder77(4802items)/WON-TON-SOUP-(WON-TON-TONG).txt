Categories: Chinese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
30    Won ton filled according to
-won ton recipe
1 c  Roast pork, sliced
1 qt Chicken and pork stock [Or
-either one. S.C.]
2    Stalks green onions, minced
1 ts Sesame oil [The dark,
-cooked Oriental type. S.C.]
You can fiddle with the ingredients to your hearts content. Roast
pork is available at Chinese markets and you could probably get it to
go at Chinese restaurants.  Or try meat from good ol' American BBQ
ribs, slivered. Or thinly sliced raw chicken.  Or thinly sliced
shrimp or scallops. Or no meat at all...

Yield: 4 servings

PREPARATION:

Prepare won ton filling and wrap as in won ton recipe. Heat stock.

COOKING:

Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add won ton and boil for 4 to 5
minutes. Remove won ton with bamboo skimmer or slotted spoon and
transfer to soup bowls.  Garnish with roast pork and green onions.
Pour heated stock over won ton.  Drizzle sesame oil over won ton and
serve.

DO-AHEAD NOTES;

Wrap and freeze won ton.  Drop frozen won ton directly into boiling
water and boil for 5 to 6 minutes.

COMMENTS:

Unless you're Chinese you probably don't know what won ton means.
"Won" means cloud and "Ton" means swallow. Since won ton wrappers are
light and fragile as clouds, biting onto won ton is like swallowing a
cloud.
