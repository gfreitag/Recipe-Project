Sometimes zucchini grows to gargantuan proportions; you can use up
those squash monsters in this snappy relish. The recipe makes six 1
pint jars. You'll need a cheesecloth lined colander or strainer and a
food processor or grinder in addition to the basic equipment.

1. Wash zucchini, peel if desired or if skin is very tough. Peel and
cut onions into quarters.

2. Put vegetables through coarse blade of food grinder or chop
coarsely.

3. In large mixing bowl, combine ground zucchini and onions with
salt; mix well. Set aside and let stand overnight.

4. Next day, organize and prepare ingredients, equipment, and work
space.

5. Drain vegetables into a cheesecloth lined colander. Rinse with cold
water and drain again.

6. In large kettle, combine all remaining ingredients and heat to
boiling.

7. Stir in zucchini and onions and heat to boiling, then reduce heat
and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

8. Ladle relish into hot jars to within 1/4 inch of tops. Run a slim,
non metal tool down along the insides of jars to release any air
bubbles. Add additional relish, if necessary, to within 1/4 inch of
tops.

9. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

10. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

11. Process in a boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Follow the basic
steps for boiling water bath canning,
10    through 19.
