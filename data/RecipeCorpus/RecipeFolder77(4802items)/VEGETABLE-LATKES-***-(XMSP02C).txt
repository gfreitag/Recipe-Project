for such a great response!  Let me add a recipe from last year's
VEGETARIAN TIMES (12/90). Place vegetables in a strainer and press
out liquid. Transfer to a bowl. Stir in flour and wheat germ. In
another bowl, mix together eggs, garlic and soy sauce; add to veggies
(if mixture is watery, add additional flour or matzoh meal). Heat
enough oil to cover surface of a large, heavy skillet. When hot, drop
veggie mixture by soupspoonsful into the pan. Cook over medium heat
until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Turn and brown the other
side. Serve hot with additional soy sauce to taste.  Makes 8
pancakes, (4 servings of 2 pancakes each) Per serving: 240 cal.; 12g
