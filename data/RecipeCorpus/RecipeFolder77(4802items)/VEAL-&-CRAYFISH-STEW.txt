COMBINE THE VEAL and 4 cups broth in a 5-quart heavy pot over high
heat on top of the stove. Cover and bring to a boil. Remove any scum
that comes to the top of the pot, then add the remaining broth, the
onion, celery, carrot, salt, pepper, nutmeg and lemon. Reduce heat to
low and let simmer for 1 1/4 hours, or until meat is just tender.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pot, over low heat, and whisk in the
flour. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes and remove from heat. Set aside
until the meat is cooked. When the meat is done, remove it from the
liquid with a slotted spoon. Pick off and discard any vegetables that
cling to the veal. Place the butter-flour mixture over medium-low
heat on the stove. Strain the cooking liquid into it, whisking, and
add the sherry and cream. Discard vegetables in the strainer. Cook,
stirring, until mixture thickens, about 3 to 5 minutes. Replace the
meat in the pot and add the mushrooms and crayfish. Pour in the
sauce, place the pot, uncovered, over medium heat and cook 10
minutes. To serve, pour into a serving dish.
