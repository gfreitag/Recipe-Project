(I see no reason why you can't use margarine for any instance of
butter in this recipe.  -K.M.)

First thoroughly grease a 22-23 cm (9 to 9-1/2-inch) ring mould, 1.2
liter (2 pint) capacity with butter.

Since the basis of both nut mixtures is fried onion, you can melt the
butter for both of them in a large saucepan, add both the onions and
fry for 10 minutes until tender but not browned. Put half the mixture
into a bowl on one side.  To complete the dark/outer mixture, add the
mushrooms and mixed herbs to the pan. Skin the tomatoes, if you're
using fresh ones, chop and add to the saucepan, or just mash in the
canned ones, without any juice.  Let this mixture cook until all the
liquid has gone, then remove from the heat and stir in all the
remaining ingredients, and 50 ml (2 fl oz) of the water, to make a
medium-soft mixture.

To complete the almond and lemon layer, grind the almonds and add to
the other lot of fried onion, along with the crumbs and 200 ml (7 fl
oz) water, and flavour with lemon rind and juice. I like this mixture
really lemony, and use the grated rind and juice of 1-1/2 lemons; if
that is too much for your taste, adjust the amount accordingly, and
perhaps add a tablespoonful or two more water.  The mixture should be
quite soft but not sloppy.

To make the mushroom pate, wash the mushrooms and chop the roughly.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the mushrooms and fry them,
without a lid on the pan ~- they will soon make a great deal of
liquid. Continue to cook them, uncovered, until all the liquid has
gone -- this may take as long as 30 minutes.  Then liquidize with the
breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper.

Set the oven to 190 C/375 F/Gas Mark 5.

To assemble the ring, first press the dark nut mixture into the tin,
to cover the base and all the way up the sides to within about 5 mm
(1/4 inch) of the top (leave this clear to allow the mixture to rise
a bit as it cooks).  Next, put in the white mixture, over the dark
one, to cover it. Add the mushroom pate to fill the ring. When it is
all in, gently press the top so that it is level, about 5 mm (1/4
inch) below the top. Cover with a piece of greased foil.

When you are ready to bake the ring, put it into the oven and bake for
1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, or until the ring feels firm to the touch and a
skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Let it stand for 2-3
minutes, then loosen the edges, put a large round plate on top of it,
and turn it upside down; hopefully it will come out in one piece.
fill the centre with stuffing balls, decorate the top with slices of
tomato, lemon and parsley, and serve immediately.
