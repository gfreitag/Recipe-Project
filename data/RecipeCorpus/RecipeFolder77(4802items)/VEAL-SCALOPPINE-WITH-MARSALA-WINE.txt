Categories: Other meat
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Veal scaloppine
1/4 c  Butter
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepp
3/4 c  Dry marsala wine; or sherry
Recipe by: lrao@ICSI.Net (Luke Rao) Place scaloppine between 2 pieces
of waxed paper and pound until thin. When pounding meat do not use a
straight up-and-down movement. Use a sliding action so meat is
stretched more than flattened.  Place scaloppine on aluminum foil.
Coat meat lightly with flour.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt 3
tablespoons butter with oil in a large heavy skillet. When butter
foams, add veal. Cook over high heat about 1 minute on each side.
Veal should be light golden outside and pink inside. Remove veal from
skillet. Add 1 tablespoon butter and Marsala or sherry.  Deglaze
skillet by stirring to dissolve meat juices attached to bottom of
skillet. When wine is reduced by half, return veal to skillet. Mix
gently with sauce.  Place meat on a warm platter. Spoon sauce over
meat.  Serve immediately.
