5 lb Chicken pieces
4    Heads garlic
9 lb Onions
1 c  Red vinegar
2    Fresh chili peppers

3 tb Cooking oil

Wash chicken pieces and pat dry. Divide garlic into cloves and
:
crush and peel. In a large pot combine onions, garlic, vinegar, fresh
chili peppers and crushed peppers and black pepper. Add chicken
pieces. Stir well and let marinate in this mixture for at least one
hour, or cover and refrigerate overnight. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a
large pan over medium high heat. Remove chicken pieces from marinate
and fry in oil until browned on all sides. Remove pieces and set
aside. Remove onions from marinate and fry in the same oil until
golden brown. Return onions and chicken to marinate and bring mixture
to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for two hours or until chicken is
cooked through and flavors are blended. The longer the mixture
simmers the more the flavors are developed.
Meanwhile, in a large pot, coat the bottom with a small
:
amount of oil. Heat the pot over medium-high heat and brown the rice
lightly. Add water and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low.
Cook for 30 to 50 minutes, until rice is tender and water is absorbed.
When ready to eat, add salt and pepper and soy sauce to
:
chicken mixture. To serve, spread rice in a wide flat platter or
bowl. Let cool for 10 minutes. Remove chicken pieces from sauce and
distribute over rice. Pour onions and sauce over the top as desired.
