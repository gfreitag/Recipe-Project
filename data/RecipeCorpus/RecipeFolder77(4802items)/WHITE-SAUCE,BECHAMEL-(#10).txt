Title: WHITE SAUCE/BECHAMEL (#10)
Categories: Sauce, Woman's day
Yield: 2 Cups
3 tb Butter
3 tb Flour
2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
x  Freshly ground black pepper
1.  In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter* over low heat, until foamy.
With a wooden spoon, stir in the flour until a thick paste forms.
This is called a "roux."

2.  Whisk in the milk until smooth.  Stirring occasionally, cook 10
to 12 minutes, until simmering, thick, and smooth. Simmer 2 minutes
to "cook out" the flour taste.

3.  Season with the salt and freshly ground black pepper.

TIP:  * If you brown the butter slightly after it has melted (don't
burn it!), it will add a nutty flavor to the sauce.
