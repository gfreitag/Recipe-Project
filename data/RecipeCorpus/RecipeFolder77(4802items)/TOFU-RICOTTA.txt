Title: TOFU RICOTTA
Categories: Cheese
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb . tofu (soft curd)
1/4 cup  olive oil (extra-virgin)
1    Tbl. honey
1    Tbl. lemon juice
1    tea. salt Mash tofu with a fork. Stir in remaining
ingredients. Refrigerate for 1/2 hour or more. Use in place of
ricotta in recipe. Approx. 2 lbs. (For deserts, you might want to add
a bit less oil. For lasagna, manicotti, etc, saute finely minced
onion and garlic in the oil before adding.  I usually leave the salt
out as we are not salt eaters, but the flavor is closer to ricotta's
with the salt.)
