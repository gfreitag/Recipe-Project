In a bowl, combine bread crumbs, mustard, black pepper, garlic powder,
basil and oregano. In a large bowl, combine eggs, ketchup, hot pepper
sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard and horseradish. Mix in the
onion and ground beef, then add the bread crumb mixture. Place
mixture in 9- by 5-inch loaf pan and bake in 35O degree oven for 1

To assemble, lay 1/2-inch slice of meatloaf on bottom slice of bread,
