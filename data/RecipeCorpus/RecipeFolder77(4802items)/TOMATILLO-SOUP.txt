Title: TOMATILLO SOUP
Categories: Soup, Low fat
Yield: 8 Servings
Vegetable oil spray
1 c  Onion -- chopped
3    Cloves garlic -- chopped
1 lb Tomatillos -- remove husks
Quarter
1    Jalapeno -- seed and chop
1    Chicken bouillon cube
1 lb Orzo -- cooked and drained
1/2 c  Nonfat sour cream
Lightly spray a nonstick 4-quart Dutch oven with vegetable oil and
place over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, a few teaspoons water,
and cook, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes until the vegetables
are tender. Add 3 cups water, tomatillos, jalapeno, and bouillon cube
and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer 8 to 10 minutes. Cool
slightly.

Transfer the mixture to a food processor, or use an immersion, or
hand, blender, and puree until smooth. Return the mixture to the
Dutch oven, stir in the orzo, and heat through, but don't boil.
Either stir in the sour cream in the pot or add a dollop on each
serving. [McRecipe:patH 18 Aug 96]
