Title: TROUT & SOUR CREAM
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Fish per person
1 oz Unsalted butter per fish
2 tb Sour cream
2 tb Water per fish
Salt and pepper
The fish should be very fresh, gutted and scaled but not split. Melt
the butter.  When it foams, slip in the fish. Brown swiftly, turning
once. Pour the sour cream and water around them, add salt and freshly
ground pepper, and let the fish simmer for 10 minutes.

Serve with small new potatoes boiled in their jackets: or chanterelle
mushrooms fried in butter (if you can get them).
