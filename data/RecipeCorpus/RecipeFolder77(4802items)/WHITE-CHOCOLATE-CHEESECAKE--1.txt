Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE -1
Categories: Cheesecakes, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
Crust-----
1 1/2 c  Chocolate Cookie Crumbs
3 tb Butter -- melted
Filling-----
24 oz Cream Cheese -- softened
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla
3    Eggs
1/2 lb White Chocolate -- melted
heat oven to 350F.

Mix crumbs and butter and press onto bottom of a 9-inch springform
pan. Bake for 10 minutes.

Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla at medium until well blended.
Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Blend in
the white chocolate. Pour over crust.

Bake for 35 minutes and turn oven off and let cool in oven for at
least an hour.  Loosen cake from rim of pan and continue cooling.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (best if over night). I like to
garnish this with dollops of whipped cream and a sprinkling of
crushed chcoclate cookies.
