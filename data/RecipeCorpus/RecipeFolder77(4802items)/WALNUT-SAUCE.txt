Title: WALNUT SAUCE
Categories: Vegetarian, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Walnuts; raw
3 tb Liquid aminos
1 tb Lemon juice
2 c  Vegetable stock
1    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/8 ts Black pepper
Put the flour in a small dry frying pan over medium heat and toast,
stirring often, until it has darkened evenly to a light brown.
Transfer the flour to a blender. Add the walnuts, liquid aminos,
lemon juice,garlic, pepper, and 1/2 cup of the vegetable bouillon to
the blender and blend until smooth. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of
the bouillon and blend until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a medium
saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat, and simmer, stirring
often, until the mixture is thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve hot.
This was developed especially for the zucchini boats, but is also
good over brown rice, potatoes and vegetables.
