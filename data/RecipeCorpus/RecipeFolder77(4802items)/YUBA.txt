Yuba, also known as bean curd skin, is the skin that forms on soy
milk when it is heated.  It is used in Chinese and Japanese cooking
in a variety of [??] and main dishes and is considerred a delicacy.

Ingredients and Instructions:

Set up a double boiler arangement with the steaming container between
1.5 and 3" deep and about 12" diameter. Pour soymilk into boiler to
about 1.25" depth.  Heat to about 175F.  After a few minutes a skin
will form across the top of the liquid.  When this skin has covered
the whole surface, separate from the edges w/a knife blade. Carefully
lift an edge of the skin off of the liquid and slide a chopstick
underneath. Lift the skin off the liquid and drape the chopstick over
something so the sheet of yuba hangs free.  After a few minutes, lay
the sheet out onto a plate.

Repeat this process until the liquid is used up, then remove from
heat. There should be a thin film of reddish stuff on the bottom of
the pan. This is called sweet yuba and has a distinct flavor, also
quite yummy.

As for serving, this book gives a bunch of suggestions, but I'll
leave you w/these.  You can cut it bup and use it in stir fry, wrap
veggies in it, roll it up and dip it in, eg. honey vinegar sauce,
miso vinegar sauce, honey lemon sauce, wasabi shoyu sauce. Converted
