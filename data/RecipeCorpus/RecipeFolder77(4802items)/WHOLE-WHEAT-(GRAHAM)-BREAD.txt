Title: WHOLE WHEAT (GRAHAM) BREAD
Categories: Dorcas, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Yeast cak
1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
2 c  Flour
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Salt
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Brown sugar
3 tb Shortening
4 c  Wheat flour
Soften yeast in the lukewarm water.  Add 2 cups flour, sugar, and
salt; beat until smooth.  Let rise until bubbly. Combine remaining
water, brown sugar, and shortening. Heat until shor- tening melts.
Cool, add to yeast mix.  Add wheat flour.  Mix until smooth.
Knead 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, let rise 1
1/2    hours.

*The remaining directions were implied with the word "etc". I assume
the dough would be punched down, allowed to rest, formed into loaves,
and placed in greased loaf pans before allowing to rise the final
time prior to baking.  I included this one because there is an
underlined statement at the bottom of the card: "I have made many
times. Old standby."
