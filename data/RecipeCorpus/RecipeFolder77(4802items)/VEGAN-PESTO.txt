Title: VEGAN PESTO
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Basil leaves, washed and
Dried
3/4 c  Soymage parmesean
Substitute
1/2 pk Mori-Nu Lite tofu
1 ts Olive oil (optional!)
2    Cloves garlic
Blend or process in food processor til creamy.  This comes out
looking more like guacamole than pesto, but it's yummy!

Before I found the Soymage, I tried some miso paste with the basil.
YUK! Something about the flavors just DIDN'T meld, IMHO. Of course,
YMMV!
