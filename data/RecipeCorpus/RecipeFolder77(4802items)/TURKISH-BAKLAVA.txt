Categories: Desserts, Turkish, Greek
Yield: 24 Servings
1    Pkg Fillo Sheets
1 lb Butter, melted
1 lb Walnuts, chopped
3 c  Sugar, white granulated
1/2 ts Ground Cloves
1 ts Ground Cinnamon or
1/4 ts Ground and 1 Stick Cinnamon
9 x 13 Pyrex Baking Dish
Pastry Brush
1. Chop walnuts to medium fine and mix with 1 cup sugar, 1/4 Teaspoon
ground Cinnamon and 1/4 Teaspoon ground Cloves. 2. Melt Butter. 3. Cut
Fillo in half so that each sheet fits the bottom of the Baking Pan. 4.
Generously butter the bottom and sides of the baking pan and place the
Fillo, one sheet ata a time, in the baking pan. Generously spread
butter on each sheet of fillo as it is placed in the pan. Every 6 to
8 sheets of Fillo sp[read a layer of walnut mix.  Continue layering
Fillo sheets and walnuts until Fillo is complete. Pour any remaining
butter over top of the Baklava.  The secret to good flaky Baklava is
to have each sheet of Fillo well buttered so that the sheets do not
stick together. 5. With a sharp knife, cut the Baklava diagonally to
form diamond shaped pieces. 6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake
the Baklava for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown on top.
Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. 7. SYRUP Mix one cup
water, two cups sugar, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves and either 3/4
teaspoons Cinnamon or the Cinnamon stick in a sauce pan and bring to
a bnoil. Simmer for 20 minutes. 8. Pour the boiling syrup over the
cool Baklava and allow to cool completely again. When cool serve
individual pieces with strong (Turkish) sweet coffee and dried
apricots for an exquisite dessert.
