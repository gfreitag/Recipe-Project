Title: TUNA SASHIMI WITH ORANGE GLAZE
Categories: Fish, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Ripe plum tomatoes
2 c  Fresh orange juice
2 tb Green peppercorns in water
- drained
1/2 ts Salt; or as desired
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 lb Fresh tuna;
- in 1/4-in-thick slices
2    Oranges; peeled, in sections
CUT OFF TIP AND STEM of tomatoes; remove seeds and core. Slice
tomatoes into flat slices; lay each slice flat. Cut lengthwise into
1/4-inch strips, pile strips; cut horizontally in 1/4-inch pieces.
Reserve on a plate in refrigerator, covered. Chill 4 plates. In a
small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine juice, 1 tablespoon
green peppercorns and salt. Bring to boil and reduce until only 2/3
cup remains. The mixture should be thick and syrupy. Transfer liquid
to bowl and cool to room temperature. When cool, beat in oil to make
"glaze." If the mixture has a very shiny appearance and seems like
it's going to separate, add a few drops of water or orange juice. To
serve, spoon glaze onto plates. Arrange sliced fish on top. Garnish
with the orange sections, the remaining tablespoon of green
peppercorns and the chopped tomato.
