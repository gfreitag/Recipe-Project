Title: TYROPITTAKIA (CHEESE PIES)
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian, Pies
Yield: 25 Pies
8 oz Feta cheese
2 oz Gruyere cheese or cottage
Cheese (see note)
2    Eggs (lightly beaten)
-
2 tb Fresh mint or dill, finely
Chopped
8    To 10 sheets of fillo pastry
3 oz Melted butter
Oil for greasing
Preheat the oven to 350 F/ 180 C/ gas mark 4.

To make the filling, drain the feta of its salty water and crumble
into a bowl with a fork or fingers. Add the Gruyere/cottage cheese,
eggs and dill/mint to the Feta and mix well.

Cut the whole stack of fillo pastry into 3/4 long strips about 3
inches wide. Brush each sheet with melted butter, place a (quite
heaped) teaspoon of filling at one end (in the corner). Fold over
diagonally to cover and keep folding into triangular pies - making
sure that all sides have as many layers as possible to avoid
spillage. Place the pies on an oiled baking sheet, brush the tops
with butter and bake for 20 minutes or until crisp and light golden.

Good when warm - can keep for a few days in an airtight container.

You could also use more spinach instead of the herbs and decrease the
amount of cheese used proportionally.

(note: Here in the UK Feta is saltier than in Greece so this is why
these ingredients are added)
