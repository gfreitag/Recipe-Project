Grind meat through a 1/4" or 3/8" grinder plate. Add all the
ingredients, except the water and mix thoroughly until evenly
distributed. Then place the meat in the food processor, adding the
water as you go along.  This will help emulsify the meat.
Stuff into a 32-35mm hog casing and make 5" to 6" links. Place
into 160 degree F. water and cook until an internal temperature of
150 degrees F. is attained. Then shower the sausage with cool water
until the internal temperature falls to 75 degrees F.  Place in
cooler overnight before using.
