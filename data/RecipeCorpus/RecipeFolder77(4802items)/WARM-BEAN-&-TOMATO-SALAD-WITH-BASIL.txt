2 tb Fresh Basil, chopped
Salt
3 tb Olive Oil
1 tb Balsamic or Red Wine Vinegar

Remove the ends from the beans and cut into 1 12 inch lengths. Cook
in boiling water until just tender, about 5 - 7 minutes. Drain well.
Meanwhile heat one tablespoon of oil in a large frypan over medium

vinegar and cook until liquid is reduced. Drain chickpeas and stir in
chickpeas and green beans; cook until heated through, about 2
minutes. In a serving bowl, combine the bean mixture with tomatoes,
olives and basil. Whisk together the remaining oil with lemon juice
and pour over salad; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm
or at room temperature. Serves 2 as main course, 4 as side dish. From
