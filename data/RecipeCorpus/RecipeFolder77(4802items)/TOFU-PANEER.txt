Title: TOFU PANEER
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Corn oil, unrefined
1 c  Diced onions
2 tb Minced garlic
4 ts Minced ginger
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Tumeric
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
2 ts Ground coriander
4 ts Cilantro
2 tb Garam marsala
-(see recipe below, or
- use commercial blend)
35 oz Canned Italian tomatoes
1/2 lb Firm silken tofu
1 1/2 c  Green peas
-(pref. fresh, OR frozen)
MMMMM-----------------------GARAM MARSALA----------------------------
5    3" cinnamon sticks
1 c  Whole cardamom pods
1/2 c  Whole cloves
1/2 c  Whole cumin seeds
1/2 c  Whole black peppercorns
1/4 c  Coriander seeds
Heat the oil in a saucepan.  Saute the onions, garlic, ginger, salt,
tumeric, cayenne, coriander, cilantro, and garam marsala for about 5
minutes.

Drain the juice from the tomatoes into the sauteed vegetables. Then
crush the tomatoes by hand and add them to the vegetables. Dice the
tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and add to the vegetables. Continue to cook
for 10 to 15 minutes over low heat.  Then add the peas and cook
another 4 minutes. Serve hot over brown rice.  A coriander coconut
chutney (or other chutney) is an excellent accompaniment.

GARAM MARSALA:  Preheat the oven to 200 F.  Place the ingredients on a
baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes, or until the spices give off an
aroma.  (Some chefs suggest roasting each ingredient separately,
since each gives its characteristic aroma at a different time.)

Separate the cardamom pods from the seeds.  Discard the pods. Crush
the cinnamon.  Combine the cinnamon, cardamom seeds, and other spices
until the mixture is powdery. Store in a sealed jar.
