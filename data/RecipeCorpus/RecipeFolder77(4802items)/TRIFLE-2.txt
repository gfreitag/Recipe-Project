2    Egg whites
1 c  Heavy cream

This is a wonderful recipe.  It calls for frozen fruit, but I don't
see why you couldn't substitute fresh fruit if available.

Thaw and drain fruit.  Slice sponge cake into three thin layers.
Place one layer in the bottom of a serving bowl. It should be
flat-bottomed and about 10 inches across and five inches deep. If you
have one of glass, use it because the layers of the trifle look very
pretty. Sprinkle the cake layer with one-quarter cup sherry. Spread
about 1 third of the raspberries and peach slices on top. Pour
one-third of the custard over the fruit. Repeat cake, sherry, fruit
and custard layers, saving a dozen or so raspberries for garnish. To
make the topping, beat egg white until stiff and in a separate bowl,
whip cream. Stir sugar into cream and gently fold in beaten egg
white. Mound cream and egg white mixture over the top of the trifle.
Garnish with raspberries and toasted almonds. Refrigerate until ready
to serve.

Custard Sauce: Scald milk in a double boiler. Meanwhile, beat egg
yolks and add sugar and salt. Pour a little hot milk into the egg
yolk mixture, beating with a fork, and then stir into the rest of the
milk. Place over simmering, not boiling, water and cook -- stirring
until the mixture coats a metal spoon. Pour the cutard into a bowl
and stir in the vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for one hour or until
thickened before adding to trifle. From: Sandee Eveland
