*Gyoza skins are 3" wide rounds similar to wonton skins, although
they are slightly thinner.  They're available fresh or frozen in most
Asian markets. If necessary, use wonton skins.

In skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add red pepper,
green onion, mushrooms and gingerroot; cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add
cabbage, carrot, soy sauce and sesame oil; cook, stirring
occasionally, 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Working one at a time to prevent Gyoza skins from drying out, place a
heaping teaspoon of vegetable mixture in center of each round.
Moisten edge of round with water and fold in half to enclose filling.
Pinch edges to seal completely.  Set filled dumplings on a plate and
cover with plastic wrap.

To make fried dumplings, heat 1" vegetable oil over medium-high heat
in 2-quart saucepan.  In batches, fry dumplings, turning, until
browned on both sides - about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and
serve.

To cook dumplings in broth, in 2-quart saucepan heat bouillon mixture
to simmering.  In batches, cook dumplings in simmering broth 3
minutes. Remove with slotted spoon, dividing among 4 serving bowls or
deep plates. When all dumplings are cooked, spoon 2 tb. remaining
broth over each serving. Garnish with cilantro, if desired, and serve.
