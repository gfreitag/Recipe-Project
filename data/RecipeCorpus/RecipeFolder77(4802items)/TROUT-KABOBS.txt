1 lg Green pepper
1 qt Water
4 sm Onions; (1/2 pound)
16    French bread cubes; (1.5 x 1

You'll need 4 metal skewers 16 inches long.

Core and seed green pepper, cutting it in half.  In a 3 quart

running water and drain again.

Cut the onions in half.  Cut the green pepper into 1" pieces. Cut
fish into 1" chunks.  Alternately thread 2 onion halves, 1/4 of the
green pepper pieces, 1/4 of the fish and 4 bread cubes on each skewer.

In a 1-quart saucepan, heat butter and garlic salt over medium heat

vegetables with the melted butter.

Grill the kabobs 4-5" from heat, turning and brushing with margarine 4
times, until fish flakes easily at thickest part, about 8-10 minutes.

Serve kabobs on a plate of steaming white rice, with lemon wedges and
compliment with a fresh fruit salad.

Serves 4.
