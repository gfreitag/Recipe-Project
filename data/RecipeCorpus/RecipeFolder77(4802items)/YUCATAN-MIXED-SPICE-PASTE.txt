12    Cloves garlic, unpeeled
2 ts Dried oregano
1 ts Black peppercorns (scant 1
-1/2 tsp. ground)
1/4 ts Allspice berries (generous
-1/4 tsp. ground)

-ground)
1/4 ts Cumin seeds (generous 1/4
-tsp. ground)
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Cider vinegar
I ts all-purpose white flour

Roast unpeeled garlic on a griddle or a heavy skillet set over medium
heat for about 15 minutes, turning frequently, until blackened in
spots and very soft inside. Remove, cool and slip off skins.

If using whole spices, place oregano, black pepper, allspice, cloves
and cumin in a mortar or spice grinder and pulverize thoroughly.
Transfer to a small bowl and add salt. If using ground spices,
combine them with salt in a small bowl. Mince garlic finely and
sprinkle it with some of the spice mixture. Use the back of a spoon
to work it back and forth, mashing it to a smooth paste. Add the
garlic-spice mixture to the remaining spices in the bowl, then work
in vinegar and flour. Scrape into a small jar, cover and let stand in
the refrigerator for several hours or preferably overnight before
using. The paste will keep for several weeks, refrigerated.

Makes about 3 Tbsp.
