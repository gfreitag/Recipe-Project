For 8 or 9" pie shell

Sifted all-purpose flour    2 1/4 cups
1 1/3    cups Salt 1 1/2 teasp,
1 teasp. Cold milk* 1/3 cup 3 tablesp. Salad oil 1/2
cup plus 1 tablesp.
1/3    cup

In bowl, mix flour and salt. Pour milk and salad oil into same
measuring cup (don't stir); add, all at once, to flour. With 4-tined
fork, stir lightly until well mixed. Form into smooth ball between
cupped hands; divide in half for two-crust pie. Roll out between 2
12" squares of waxed paper, using short, very gentle, strokes until
circle reaches edges of paper. (For two-crust pie, roll out only one
half of dough now.) Peel off top paper. (If pastry breaks, press
edges together or press piece of pastry over tear.) With paper side
up, place in pie plate. Carefully peel off paper. Gently fit pastry
into plate. (For two-crust pie follow individual pie recipe. For 8"
or 9" pie shell, see below.)

Fit pastry into 8" or 9" pie plate and make attractive edge. Then,
with Bake at 450Ã¸ F. 12 to 15 min., or till golden. Peek after 5
min.; if bubbles appear, prick. Cool on wire rack before filling.

* For two-crust pie, you can substitute 5 tablesp. plus 2 teasp. ice
water for milk; for pie shell, 1/4 cup minus 1 teasp. ice water. Beat
water with salad oil until thickened and creamy. Then add
immediately, all at once, to flour. When rolling dough, use unfloured
board instead of waxed paper if desired.
