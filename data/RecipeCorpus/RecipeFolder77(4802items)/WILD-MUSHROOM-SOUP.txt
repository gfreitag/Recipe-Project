Here's one for you lucky folks that have chanterelles popping up in

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Remove from
heat and stir in the flour, whisking as you go. Add the salt and
pepper. Return to heat and slowly whisk in the wine. Simmer for 3 or
4 minutes, continuing to whisk until well blended and slightly
thickened. Add the onions. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring from
time to time.

Heat the stock in a saucepan, add the mushrooms and simmer for 10
minutes over medium heat.

Combine mushroom mixture and wine mix mixture; simmer for 20 minutes.
The scent of this cooking is unbelievably fragrant!

The finished stew may be served alone, or over rice, polenta or
pasta, and is nice garnished with a little parsley or young arugula.

Serves 3 or 4.
