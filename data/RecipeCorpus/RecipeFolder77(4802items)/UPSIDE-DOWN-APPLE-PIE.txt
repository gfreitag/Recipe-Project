Title: UPSIDE DOWN APPLE PIE
Categories: Pies
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Pecan or walnut halves
1/3 c  Brown sugar, packed
1 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Salt
2 ts Lemon juice
5 c  Apples, peeled, cored sliced
Pastry for 1 crust pie
My note:  this recipe worked with a deep dish pie plate and one piece
of foil.  Used 8 cup measure to mix pastry, then measure apples, then
poured sugar mixture over the apples.

Line a 9 inch pie plate with a wide circle of foil. Take 2 pieces of
12 inch foil about 2 feet long.  Make a drugstore fold lengthwise
resulting in 1 large square. Press into pie plate. Spray or grease
heavily on bottom and sides up to top edge of pie plate.

Place pecans or walnut halves round side down on bottom of foil in pie
plate.  Sprinkle with brown sugar.

Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice in large bowl.
Stir well.  Stir apples and dry mixture together and spread over nuts
in pie plate.

Roll pastry and place over top.  Fold edges under and flute. (This
makes a rim to hold the juice when pie is turned upside down.) Turn
up foil all around. Trim foil leaving 4" high. (This may be more
important if you have a regular pie plate to keep filling from
running over.)

Cut slits in pastry.  Bake in 350 F oven about 55 minutes until
apples are cooked.  Cover with large plate and invert so pie is
upside down. Remove foil carefully. Serve warm.
