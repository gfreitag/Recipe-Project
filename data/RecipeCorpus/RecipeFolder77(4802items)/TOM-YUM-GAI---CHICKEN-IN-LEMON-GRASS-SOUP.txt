(Thai Chicken in Lemon Grass Soup) This is from Charmaine Solomon's
newest publication: THAI COOKBOOK.

TO MAKE PEPPER AND CORIANDER PASTE: This is a basic Thai flavoring
and will make about one cup which you can store in your fridge. You
will use about one teaspoon of it in the Tom Yum Gai. In a dry
skillet, dry roast about one Tbs whole black peppercorns for a minute
or two.

In your blender whizz up the peppercorns together with 2 or 3 garlic
cloves, 2 tsp salt, 2 Tbs lemon juice, and a big bunch of fresh
coriander (cilantro) which you have coarsely chopped, stems and roots
included (about 2 cups).

TO MAKE THE SOUP: Whack each drumstick in two. Whizz up the garlic,
chillies, and Pepper and Coriander Paste together in your blender,
and mix with the chicken. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Place the
stock, lime leaves (or zest), onions, galangal, lemon grass, and
sugar in a large saucepan together with the chicken and simmer about
30 minutes or until chicken is tender. Add fish sauce and lime juice.
Adjust flavorings for spicy and sour to your taste. Serve garnished
with coriander and sliced chillies.

NOTES: Be aware that the fresh chillies used for this recipe are very
acidic. Thorougly wash your hands after handling. DO NOT rub your eyes
until you have washed your hands. Submitted By CHIAPET1@IX.NETCOM.COM
