Title: TOFU RIBS
Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
1 lb tofu, marinated
Yield: 4 Servings
2 T  cold pressed vegetable oil
8 x  bamboo skewers
1 x  barbecue sauce

Pre-heat oven to 300F. Cut the marinated tofu slices lengthwise into 3
strips per slice. Brush the tofu slices on all sides with oil and lay
them, side by side, in a dish. The slices should not touch. Bake for
40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Pass
bamboo skewers carefully through the width of each slice. Five to six
slices will fit on one skewer without touching.  Cover with barbecue
sauce and pre-heat the broiler. Broil 6 inches from the heat for
about 5 minutes, turn over, and repeat. The tofu can become dark but
scorching will make it bitter.
