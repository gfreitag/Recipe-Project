Title: WESLEY'S ABM SOURDOUGH BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
5 c  Flour
1 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
1 tb Butter or margarine
1/2 ts Baking soda
Water (warm)
For the starter:  In a clean, SCALDED container, mix 2 cups of flour
and 1 cup of warm water.  Cover with plastic wrap, and let stand at
room temperature for 2 ~ 3 days until an amber liquid forms. When
this happens, stir the starter and, following manufacturer's
instructions, place in bread pan:

1/2 c Starter 3 c Flour 1 c Warm water 1 T Sugar 1/2 T Salt 1 T
Butter 1/2 t Baking Soda

Use the basic dough cycle.  When cycle is completed, allow doughball
to rest and rise in ABM for a minimum of 4 hours. Six hours is
better. After the rest/rise time, bake using your machine's
whole-wheat cycle.

Meanwhile, feed your starter with 1/2 cup flour, 1 cup warm water,
and 1 t sugar.  Mix, cover, and place in refrigerator. Use or feed on
a regular basis to keep it alive and well. As your starter matures
and ages, it will develop its own unique flavor.  Take care of your
starter, it will take care of you.
