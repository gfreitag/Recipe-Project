Categories: Appetizers, Pork

1 lb Pork loin
1    Shallot; finely chopped
1    Garlic clove; minced
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Bouquet garni; * see note
* 2 sprigs of parsley, 1/2 bay leaf, 1/4 t. thyme, wrapped in a
cheesecloth and tied with string.

Have the butcher grind the meat very coarsely. Add shallot, garlic,
salt and pepper. Mix well and pack into pate mold, rounding the top
so that the fat will collect on the sides during cooking. Lay bouquet
