Categories: Cookies
Yield: 24 Servings
From: Gaye Levy DTXT63A
3/4 c  Unsalted butter;well chilled
-cut into 12 pieces
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Sour cream
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Raspberry preserves
2 tb Powdered sugar
Using the steel blade of your Food Processor, chop butter with 1/4 cup
sugar until butter is the size of small peas, using 4 or 5 on/off
turns. Add sour cream, vanilla and salt and blend just until
combined, using about 10 on/off turns.  Sprinkle flour over and blend
just until granular crumbs form, about 15 seconds.

Press 1 generous tablespoon of crumb mixture into each of 24 miniature
muffin cups (1 3/4 diameter top). Bake at 350~ until edges of each
cake are just golden, about 22 minutes.

Immediately make 3/8-inch deep indentation in center of each using
end of a wooden spoon. Fill each with about 1/2 tsp preserves. Let
cool in pan 10 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool completely. Just
before serving, sprinkle sift powdered sugar over top of each.

Notes from Gaye: Warning! these are addictive and a threat to your
hips. They are THAT good. These will keep in an airtight container
for 2 days or frozen for future use. Substitute any type of jam or
preserves. These taste good even when you use margarine or shortening
instead of butter (which I refuse to use for health reasons).
