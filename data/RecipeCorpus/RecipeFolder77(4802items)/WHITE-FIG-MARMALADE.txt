3 lb Of white figs
3    Oranges
6 3/4 c  Sugar (3 3/8 pounds)
3    Lemons
Makes about 9 half-pints. Wash, peel and chop the figs. Wash and chop
the oranges, including the rind. Put figs and oranges in a preservng
kettle with the sugar. Place on low heat and cook, uncovered, about
45 minutes, stirring occasionally.  While this is simmering, wash,
very thinly slice and seed the lemons. Cook them in a small amount of
water until tender and drain.  About 15 minutes before the fig
mixture is done, add the lemon slices.  Ladle into hot, sterilized
jars and seal immediately.

To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe
the rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all
particles of food, seeds or spices. While contents are hot, cover
with a 1/8-inch layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add
another layer of melted paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to
seal completely.
