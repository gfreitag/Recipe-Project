Title: YORK POT ROAST~ SPICED
Categories: Penndutch, Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
5 lb Beef
1 ea Onion, sliced
3 ea Bay leaf
1 ts Peppercorns, black
1 x  Vinegar
1 x  Water
1 x  Salt & pepper
*** My notes: I used red wine vinegar and marinated the meat in the
refrigerator for a little over 24 hours. I added a little red wine
when making the gravy. Rub the meat thoroughly with the salt and
pepper and put in an earthen dish. Add the onion, bay leaves and
peppercorns. Take equal parts of vinegar and water and pour over the
meat. Let stand in this liquid for 24 hours. Put meat in a roasting
pan and sear well in oven at 400-F. When well browned, add a little
of the spiced vinegar. Cover pan tightly and cook slowly for 3-1/2
hours or until meat is tender. Add more of the vinegar if necessary.
When cooked, remove meat to a platter and thicken liquid with 1 Tbsp
flour. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes,
