water for 10 mins to soften. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl
over a pan of hot, but not boiling, water. Allow to cool but not to
set.

Beat the egg and egg yolk in a stainless steel bowl over a pan of
hot, but not boiling, water until thickened. Squeeze the gelatine
leaves and stir into the warm egg mixture until melted. Allow to cool
while still beating.

Add the melted chocolate to the mixture, a little at a time, until the
mixture is smooth and even.  Stir in the liqueur.

Whip the cream until thick and carefully fold into the chocolate
mixture.

Put the mousse in the fridge for 2 hours, until it has set.

Meanwhile, make the sauce.  Peel the kiwi fruit and pure them in a
mixer or food processor.  Add icing sugar to taste, if required. Keep
the sauce cold until ready to serve.

Pour a little sauce on 4 individual dishes.  Shape the mousse into
egg-shaped balls, using two warm tablespoons, and place them on top
of the sauce.

Garnish with a few lemon leaves, sliced strawberries or slices of kiwi
fruit.
