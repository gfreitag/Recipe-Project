Title: WHOLE WHEAT OAT SCONES DORRIE
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
2/3 c  Vegtable oil (I use canola o
1/3 c  Milk (I use skim)
1 ea Egg
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour, less abou
1 x  Two tablespoons
1 1/4 c  Quick Quaker Oats, uncooked
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Butter Buds
1/2 c  Raisins or currants
1 x  (or see below)
Mix and bake as above.  However, I recommend dividing the batch
into two rounds rather than one, so that the scones are smaller. They
are not structurally strong, and the smaller scones are easier to
handle. Further variations: 1. Whether making the original or my
variation, I sprinkle the rounds
before cutting and baking with sugar and cinnamon. 2. At
end-of-year holiday time I substitute the mixed candied fruits
seasonally available for the raisins or currants. 3. For a maple
flavor, substitute REAL maple syrup for the milk,
eliminate the sugar, and add dried milk. 4. Chop 1/2 cup walnuts
and add to either the original or the whole
wheat batch.
