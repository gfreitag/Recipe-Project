Vegetable Stock: ================

At least 8 - 10 hours before serving, place all of the
ingredients in a stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil,
skim, and simmer for 20 minutes.

Strain the liquid, return to heat, and reduce it by one-fourth.
Skim carefully during the reducing process. Remove from heat and
measure the remaining liquid. For each 2 cups of hot stock, add 1
tablespoon gelatin dissolved in 2 tablespoons of cold water. Add salt
and white pepper to taste.

Pour into a flat pan and chill for 2 - 3 hours.

For the Garnish: ================

Use any combination of 4 or 5 cold fresh seasonal vegetables, cut
thinly and shredded.

Remove the jelly from the refrigerator half an hour before
serving. Let it stand at room temperature to warm slightly (if it is
served too cold, the flavor will be lost).

To serve, scatter small amounts of vegetable garnish in soup
bowls. Break jelly into irregular pieces with a fork and place on top
of garnish. For each person, use 1/2 cup. Top with fresh herbs, such
as chives, basil, or tarragon.

If available, add edible flowers such as borage, onion, or
nasturtium petals.  Serve within 5 minutes, since jelly begins to
lose form if held longer.

Preparation time:  2 hours (elapsed time)
