William Rufus(1087-1100) Place the meat in a large saucepan and cover
with hot stock made from the bones of the deer or with hot salted
water, using 1 level teaspoon salt to 500 ml (2 pints) water. Bring
quickly to the boil to seal the meat, skim, and add the vegetables.
Lower the heat and simmer until tender. (About: 2-3 hours, depending
on the size of the joint.) Drain, leave in a warm oven for 5-10
minutes to dry off, then slice the meat. Serve with frunienty and a
little of the strained cooking liquid. If you prefer roasted verison
cook 1.35-1.8 kg (3-4 lb) haunch or saddle of venison in a medum oven
