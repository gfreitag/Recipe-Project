Title: U PONNYA'S NWA MEE HINGA (OXTAIL & WATERCRESS
Categories: Burmese, Soups/stews
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Oxtail, divided into
-sections
2    Cloves garlic, chopped fine
1 tb Fish sauce (nam pya ye)
1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Water
1/8 ts Pepper
1/2 bn Watercress, divided into
-stems
The combination of oxtail and watercress gives the soup a rather
unconventional flavor and makes it a fine luncheon dish. It is
reputed to be nourishing for nursing mothers. Watercress is
specified, as substitute for the traditional green known as 'chaste
leaf' or 'Indian wild pepper' (Vitex trifolia), kyaung- ban in
Burmese.

1.  Broil the oxtail in a gas or electric broiler until well roasted
and slightly charred, about 15 minutes. Better still, barbecue over
charcoal to impart a slightly smoked flavor.

2.  Put everything except the watercress into a pan, and bring to a
boil. Cover the pan and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour or
more to tenderize the meat until it comes away from the bone.

3.  Add the watercress, cover the pan, and cook for 3 minutes more.

Serve hot.
