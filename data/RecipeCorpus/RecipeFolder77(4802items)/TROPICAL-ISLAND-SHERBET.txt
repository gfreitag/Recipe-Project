Bananas make this rich and creamy.

nutmeg by churning about 1 minute in a food processor. Spoon into an
8 x 8-inch pan, cover with plastic food wrap, and freeze 2 to 3 hours
until firm around the edges and almost firm in the middle. Churn 10
seconds in a food processor until fluffy, return to the pan, fold in
the almonds, and freeze until firm.
