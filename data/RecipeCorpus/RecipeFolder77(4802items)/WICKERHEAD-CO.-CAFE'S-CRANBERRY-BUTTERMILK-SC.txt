Categories: Desserts, Restaurants, Dkuhnen msn
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Frozen cranberries
2 tb Granulated sugar
3 ts Baking powder
1/3 c  Butter
1 tb Grated orange rind
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Buttermilk
Blend 1/4 cup of the flour with cranberries and let stand overnight to
absorb excess moisture.  Next day, mix remaining flour and all other
dry ingredients. Cut into butter until mixture is consistency of
oatmeal. Stir in cranberries in flour and orange rind. Blend eggs and
buttermilk. Add to dry ingredients, mixing until just blended. If
dough is sticky, flour hands and pat into a 6-inch ball.  Score
deeply into six wedges. Bake in a 400F oven until top turns golden
and springs back, about 15 minutes. Glaze with fresh cream and sugar
immediately after baking. From Wickerhead Co. Cafe, 1910 Queen St.
