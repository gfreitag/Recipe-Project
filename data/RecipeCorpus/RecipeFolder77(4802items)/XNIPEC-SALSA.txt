Categories: Mexican, Condiments, Ceideburg 2

-stems removed and diced
Juice of 4 limes
I onion, diced
1    Tomato, diced
We're having our annual "Fall Festival" here in Castro Valley, but it
looks like it doesn't hold a candle to the Austin Hot Sauce Contest.

I really got a kick out of the paper.  Austin looks like a very
interesting place.  Here's the Habanero salsa recipe. I would
approach this with the greatest caution. ;-}

You don't find too many recipes for Habanero chiles. This is Pinch a
Pollo restaurant's recipe for a delicious pico de gallo made with
fresh Habaneros.

Soak the diced onion in the lime juice for at least 30 minutes. Add
all the other ingredients and mix.  Salt to taste. Serve with grilled
fish or grilled chicken. Caution: Extremely hot!
