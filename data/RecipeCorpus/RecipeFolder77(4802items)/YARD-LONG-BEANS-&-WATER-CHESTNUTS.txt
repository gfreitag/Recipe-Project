Categories: Vegetables, Chinese
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Yard-long beans
1/3 c  Water chestnuts; thin sliced
2 tb Butter
Salt & pepper
1 tb Parsley; finely chopped
Yard-long beans are a great delicacy with their tender, string-less,
quick-cooking qualities. They are an asset to any fast stir-fry dish
paired with shrimp or beef. Or try them with water chestnuts in this
manner.

Trim ends from beans and cut in 1-inch lengths. Cook in a small
amount of boiling salted water for 3 to 5 minutes, or just until
tender; drain. Add water chestnuts, butter and salt and pepper to
taste. Sprinkle with parsley. Makes about 4 servings.
