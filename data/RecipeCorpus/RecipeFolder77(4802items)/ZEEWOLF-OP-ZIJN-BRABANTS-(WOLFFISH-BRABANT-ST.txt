Melt half of the butter in a large skillet. Add the endive and
potatoes and saute until just tender.

Butter a baking dish and strew the shallots over the bottom, with a
sprinkling of salt and pepper. Lay the fish on this bed, pour in the
wine and stock, cover with foil and bake 10 minutes.

Transfer the potatoes and endive to a second baking dish, lay the
fish on top, and cover with foil to keep warm.

Reduce the cooking liquid in the fish pan to a syrup, swirl in the
remaining butter, taste for seasoning, and pour over the fish. Return
to the oven uncovered for a few minutes to give the sauce a glaze.
