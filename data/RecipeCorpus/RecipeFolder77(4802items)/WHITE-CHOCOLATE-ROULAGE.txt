Beat egg yolks at high speed of an electric mixer until foamy.

aside.

Beat egg whites (at room temperature) until foamy; gradually add
remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating until egg whites are stiff but not
dry. Fold whites into yolks. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt;
gradually fold into egg mixture. Spread batter evenly into prepared
pan. Bake at 350" for 8 to 10 minutes.

Sift powdered sugar in a 15 x 10 inch rectangle on a cloth towel.
When cake is done, immediately loosen from sides of pan, and turn out

end, roll up cake and towel together; let cake cool completely on a
wire rack, seam side down.

Unroll cake. Spread cake with half of White Chocolate Cream Filling
and carefully reroll cake, without towel. Place cake on a serving
plate, seam side down; spread remaining filing on all sides. Garnish
with white chocolate curls.
