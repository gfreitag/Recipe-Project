Title: WHITE CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE
Categories: Cakes, Cheesecakes
Yield: 12 Servings
2 lb Cream cheese
4    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
12 oz White chocolate
Soften the cream cheese in the microwave. Melt the chocolate in a
double boiler. Be careful not to get any water at all in the white
chocolate as it changes the consistency. Hershey's white chocolate
bars can be used for the white chocolate. Add sugar and eggs to cream
cheese and blend a bit. Blend in the chocolate. Pour the mixture into
a graham cracker crust and bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Let
cool slightly in oven with heat off and door slightly ajar.
(Actually, this made two pies for us, so you might want to have two
pie crusts on hand the first time you make it.)
