Preparation Time: 1:00 1. The broth flavoring. In a medium-size
skillet, heat 1 tablespoon
of vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and whole
garlic cloves, and fry until both are a deep golden-brown,
12 to 15 minutes.  Scoop into a blender, add the tomatoes and
blend until smooth. 2. The broth. Stir the broth into the tomato
mixture, partially
cover and simmer for 1/2 hour over medium heat. Season with salt.
3. The garnishing ingredients.  If the tortillas are fresh or moist,
let them dry out for a few minutes in a single layer. Slice them
in half, then slice the halves crosswise into 1/4 inch strips.
Heat 1/3 cup vegetable oil in a medium-small skillet over
medium-high.  When hot, add the tortilla strips and fry, turning
frequently, until they are crisp.  Drain on paper towels. Cut
the chiles into 1-inch squares and fry in the hot oil very
briefly, about 3 or 4 seconds; immediately remove and drain, then
place in a small serving bowl. 4. Assembling the soup. Just before
serving, divide the cheese
among 4 to 6 bowls, and top with the fried tortilla strips.
Ladle on the hot soup and serve right away.  Pass the
toasted chile separately, along with the lime.
