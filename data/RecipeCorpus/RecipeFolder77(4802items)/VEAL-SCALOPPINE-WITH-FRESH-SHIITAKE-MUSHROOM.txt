hot, sear the veal on both sides, turning quickly. Remove with a
slotted spatula to a platter and repeat until all veal is seared

2. Add the butter to the pan, then add the shiitake, mushrooms,
shallots, and garlic. Saute, sirring frequently, for 5 minutes or
until the shallots are translucent and the mushrooms have softened.

3. Add the stock, tyme, pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium
heat and simmer until the stock is reduced by half. Add the arrowroot
mixture to the pan and stir in evenly. Allow the mixture to simmer
for an additional minute or until slightly thickened.

4. Return the veal to the pan and bring back to a boil to heat the
veal through. Do not let the veal cook further, or it will toughen.
Serve immeadiately.

NOTE: This dish can be made up to a day in advance through step 3.
Reaheat the sauce over low heat to a simmer and then add the veal to
reheat it briefly. In place of the shiitake, any wild mushroom can be
used, such as Italian porcini, morels, chanterelles, or oyster
mushrooms.

Wine Note A classic French white Burgundy or a rich California
Chardonnay will pick up the wild mushroom taste.
