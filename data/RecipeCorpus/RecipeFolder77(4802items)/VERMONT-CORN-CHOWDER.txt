Categories: Main dish, Meats, Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Salt Pork; Diced
1    Onion; Lg, Diced
3 c  Corn Kernels; *
5    Potatoes; Md, Pare & Cube
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 qt Milk
Black Pepper; To taste
Saltines Or Soda Crackers
*    Use cooked fresh kernels or canned or cooked frozen. Cook the
diced salt pork over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, so that
all of the pork pieces become brown but not too dry. Remove them from
the pan with a slotted spoon.  Saute the onion in the pork fat just
until tender, but not brown.  Add the water, corn, potatoes and salt,
cooking, uncovered, until the potatoes are almost soft. Add the milk
and simmer very gently for 10 to 15 minutes to let the flavor ripen.
Taste for seasoning, adding a good bit of freshly ground pepper.
Sprinkle the surface with the salt pork and serve with a large supply
of soda crackers.
