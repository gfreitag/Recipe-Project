Prepare crepe batter the night before serving.  Thinly slice green
onions. Place one cup water in small pan on high heat. Thoroughly
blend the 12 ounce package of bot Banh Xeo mix with the two remaining
cups water until completely moistened.  Bissolve sugar in boiling cup
of water and add to batter.  Add coconut milk and green onions and
mix thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, peel and devein
shrimp. Cut in half lenghtwise. Cut pork in 2" slivers. Cut yellow
onion into quarters, then in thin slices.  Heat a few drops of oil on
medium-high heat in a 10" heavy frying pan.  Add 3 slices yellow
onion and two slices pork. Cook for a few seconds until onion is
slightly translucent and pork is white. Add 5 shrimp halves and cook
for 10 seconds. Pour in 1/2 cup batter and quickly tilt pan to form a
10" circle. Cover one half crepe with one cup bean sprouts. Reduce
heat to medium. Cook until batter looks solid. Cover partially (if
you cover completely, water will condense on crepe) and cook one
minute. Uncover and flip crepe using a spatula. Cook until slightly
crisp (approximately 1 minute).  Serve immediately to keep warm.
Serve with fresh cilantro, mint or basil leaves (optional) and large
leaves of red lettuce. To eat, tear off a piece of crepe, fill with
cilantro and wrap in lettuce leaf.  Dip in sauce and eat.  Serves 4.
