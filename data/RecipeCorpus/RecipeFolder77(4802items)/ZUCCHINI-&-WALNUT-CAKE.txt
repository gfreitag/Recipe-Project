Title: ZUCCHINI & WALNUT CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces
2 md Zucchini, unpeeled, ends
-trimmed
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Brown rice flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 pn Salt
3 lg Eggs
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Diced candied lemon peel,
-finely minced
Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter the sides of an 8 x 2-inch cake pan,
line the base with a circle of baking parchment and butter the
parchment. Using a nut mill, grind walnuts to flour and set aside.
Using the same nut mill, grind zucchini into fine shreds.  There
should be 1 cup, firmly packed, or 6 ounces.  Place in a sieve and
press out the liquid. Combine cornstarch, rice flour, baking powder
and salt; set aside.

Beat eggs with sugar until lemon-colored and very thick. A lifted
beater should leave a slowly dissolving trail of batter. Using a
large rubber spatula, lightly fold in grated walnuts and minced lemon
peel, as though mixing a souffle.  Fluff up zucchini shreds and fold
in. Sift cornstarch-flour mixture over batter and quickly fold in,
retaining as much volume as possible.

Pour into prepared pan (the batter will be loose) and bake for 40
minutes, until a tester comes out dry. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes
before unmolding onto a rack. Peel off paper, reverse onto rack right
side up, and let cool completely.

Dust with powdered sugar before serving.

Serves 8.
