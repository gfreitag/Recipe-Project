Title: ZESTY SPAGHETTI SAUCE
Categories: Main dish, Italian, Pasta, Sauces
Yield: 8 Servings
4 tb Olive oil
2    Onions, chopped
-(one red & one white)
4    Garlic cloves, chopped
3 lb Fresh or canned red
-Italian plum tomatoes
1 c  Tomato juice
5 tb Combined fresh herbs:
-basil, thyme, oregano
-rosemary, etc.
1 1/2 lb Hot and sweet Italian
-sausage
1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
-(use balsamic!)
2 tb Tomato paste
1 tb Sugar
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper to taste
1/8 ts Cayenne or red pepper
1 tb Fennel seeds
Heat the olive oil in heavy, large saucepan.  Add the onions and
garlic and cook until soft.  Cut up the tomatoes roughly and add to
the pot. Add half of the juice from the cans, along with the fennel
seeds and 2 tbs of the herbs. Cover and simmer for 2 hours.  Fry the
sausage (after taking it out of the casings, if it has them) in a
separate pan, drain off fat and add to the sauce. Taste the sauce and
add the remainder of the juice, vinegar, tomato paste, sugar, salt
and peppers as necessary to have a rich flavor. Move lid to half
cover, and simmer over very low hear for 1/2 hour, stirring
occasionally, so that the sauce does not scorch on the bottom of the
pan. The sauce may be frozen or refrigerated for several days at this
point. Toss the rest of the herbs in just before serving and stir to
mix in.
