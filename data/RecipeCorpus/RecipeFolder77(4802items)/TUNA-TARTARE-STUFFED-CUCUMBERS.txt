Title: TUNA TARTARE-STUFFED CUCUMBERS
Categories: Japanese, Appetizers, Seafood
Yield: 30 Servings
3 lg English cucumbers
1 1/4 lb Fresh tuna, minced
Juice of 3 limes
3/4 c  Minced green onions
3 tb Prepared wasabi (Japanese
-horseradish)
Ground black pepper to taste
1/2 c  Toasted pine nuts
3 tb Toasted or black sesame
-seeds
Slice the cucumbers into 1 inch rounds.  Using a small spoon, gently
scoop out the seeds, leaving a "bottom" in each piece of cucumber to
hold the filling.  Turn the cucumber cups upside down on paper towels
to drain for about 20 minutes.  Pat the inside of the cucumbers dry
with clean, dry paper towels.

Combine the tuna, lime juice, green onions, and wasabi in a small
bowl; mix well and season with black pepper. Just before filling the
cucumbers, add the pine nuts and sesame seeds to the fish mixture;
mix well.

Carefully spoon some filling into each cucumber piece, making a dome
of filling on the top of each piece. Serve chilled. Source: Rolled,
