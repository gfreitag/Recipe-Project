Drain the tuna steaks and grill them over medium-hot coals or broil

grill the tuna steaks as directed above. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in
a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add to the skillet 1/2 cup

tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon
juice and 1 tablespoon sugar. Saute just until the mixture is heated
through - about 30 seconds. Do not overcook.  Season to taste with
salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the sauteed fruit mixture
over the tuna and serve immediately.
