Title: VOODOO PUNCH
Categories: Drinks, Alcohol
Yield: 32 Servings
3/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
1    3-inch piece fresh ginger
2 tb Peppercorns, whole
1 tb Allspice, whole
4    Cinnamon sticks
2 c  Water
1    Large block of ice
26 oz Dark Caribbean rum
26 oz Vodka
2 c  Orange juice
1/2 c  Pineapple juice
10    Flowers, see note
10    Lemon slices
Peel ginger and slice thinly.  In a 1-quart saucepan, combine brown
sugar, ginger, peppercorns, allspice, cinnamon sticks and water.
Bring to boil; then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes.
Strain, discarding spices; chill.  If made ahead, set aside until
ready to use. To prepare punch for serving place ice block (should be
2 quarts) in punch bowl. Add chilled syrup, rum, vodka, orange juice
and pineapple juice. Taste and add more juices, if desired. Poke stem
of each flower through the center of a lemon slice; float slices atop
punch.  Serve each drink over ice cubes.

A few notes:  I find this recipe a little sweet, so I add the juice
of a lemon or two before serving.  The flowers that the recipe
suggests are daisies or hibiscus. It then suggests "other flowers"
but this is something to be really careful about, since the first
time I served this punch some idiot decided to try the flowers!
(takes all kinds). This is a really good for a hot summer night (yes
we do get them in Canada) - very potent punch.
