1 1/2 oz Vodka
1/2 oz Blackberry liqueur
1/2 oz Dry vermouth
1 ts Lemon juice
Lemon peel
Shake vodka, blackberry liqueur, vermouth, and lemon juice well with
ice. Strain into prechilled cocktail glass. Twist lemon peel above
drink and drop into glass.

Note: The Polish people are famed for their blackberry liqueur and if
you can get your hands on it or on Leroux blackberry liqueur called
Likier Smaku, you'll really bring the Warsaw to life.
