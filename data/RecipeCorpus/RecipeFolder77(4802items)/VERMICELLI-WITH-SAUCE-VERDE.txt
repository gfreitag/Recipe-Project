Title: VERMICELLI WITH SAUCE VERDE
Categories: Pasta, Meatless
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Vermicelli, uncooked
1 c  Packed fresh parsley
1 c  Packed fresh spinach
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
- softened
1/4 c  Olive or vegetable oil
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 c  Grated Romano cheese
2 tb Chopped walnuts
1    Garlic clove
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Dried basil leaves
Walnut halves
1. Cook pasta according to package directions; drain.

2. Meanwhile, wash parsley and spinach; shake to remove excess water,
allowing moisture to cling to leaves. In blender or food processor,
process greens with remaining ingredients except walnut halves until
mixture is a thick puree with some specks still visible. If sauce
seems too thick, add small amount of water. (Sauce thins out on hot
pasta.)

3. Toss hot pasta with sauce. Serve immediately. Garnish with walnut
halves. 4 servings.
