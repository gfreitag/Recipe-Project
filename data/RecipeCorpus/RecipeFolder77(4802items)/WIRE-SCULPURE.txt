Title: WIRE SCULPURE
Categories: Misc
Yield: 1 Servings
Stiff wire
Thin wire
Wood bases
Staple gun
Have child decide on a subject for their sculpture. Help them make a
base form from the stiff wire.  Then have them wrap the form with the
thin wire until he or she is satified with the shape. Staple form to
a wooden base with staple gun. (coat hanger wire works well for a
base, and something like phone wire works great as the thinner wire.)
