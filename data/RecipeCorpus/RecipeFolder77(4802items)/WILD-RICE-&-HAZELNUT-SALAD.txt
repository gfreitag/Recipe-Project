Categories: Salads, Grains
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Wild rice
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Hazelnuts
5 tb Currants
1 lg Orange, juice only
Citrus Vinaigrette
- with Hazelnut Oil
- (See RECIPE)
1 sm Fennel bulb

1    Crisp apple
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Rinse the wild rice, and soak it in water for a
half hour, then drain. Add 4 cups fresh water and salt, and bring to
a boil. Cook, covered, at a simmer until the grains are swollen and
tender, but still chewy, about 30 to 35 minutes. Pour the cooked rice
into a colander and let it drain briefly. While the rice is cooking,
toast the hazelnuts in the oven, 7 to 10 minutes, or until they smell
toasty. Let them cool a few minutes; then rub them in a small kitchen
towel to remove most of the skins. Don't worry about any flecks of
skins that won't come off. Roughly chop the hazelnuts, leaving the
pieces fairly large. Rinse the currants in warm water and squeeze
them dry; then cover them with the orange juice and let them soak
until needed. Prepare the vinaigrette. Add the soaked currants and
the fennel to the warm rice, and toss with the dressing. Just before
serving, cut the apple into small pieces, add it to the rice, along
with the hazelnuts, and toss. Season with freshly ground black
pepper, and additional salt, if needed, and serve.
