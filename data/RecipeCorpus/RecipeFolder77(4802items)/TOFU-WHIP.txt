Title: TOFU WHIP
Categories: Sauces, Desserts, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Firm or extra-firm tofu
- drained & cut into chunks
1/4 c  Maple syrup
1 tb Vanilla
1 tb Water, or more, optional
It's light, fast, and a perfect complement to pies, puddings, and
fruit compotes.  Tofu Whip can be stored in the refrigerator for up
to 1 week; if the mixture separates, blend it thoroughly before
using. The recipe may be cut in half.

In a food processor or blender, blend all of the ingredients until
very creamy, adding water if needed to achieve a whipped cream
consistency. Refrigerate until needed.

VARIATION: Instead of maple syrup, try 3 to 4 tablespoons of
fruit-sweetened preserves and some finely minced citrus peel. Choose
the fruit and citrus flavors to complement the dessert.

Makes about 2 cups
