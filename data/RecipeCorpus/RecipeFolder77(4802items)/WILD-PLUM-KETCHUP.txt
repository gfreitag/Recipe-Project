This recipe is taken from the Presbyterian Cook Book, compiled by the
ladies of the First Presbyterian Church, Dayton, Ohio. Wild plums are
a native American fruit, found in most eastern and central states.
They ripen in August and September.  Tart cultivated plums may be
substituted [My note:  a la Banana Ketchup I added rum for the "wild"
plum part!}

Add the sugar to the plums (I did it in layers; the first couple
layers at the bottom of the pot, I slashed the plums so they would
leak a bit faster and not caramelize the sugar), and place over
medium heat. Cover. After 30 minutes, increase the heat and stir the
plum-sugar mixture. Break some of the plums with a wooden spoon (my
note: this is important. Boiling sugar is very very hot; a wooden
spoon will stay cool whereas a metal utensil may heat up).

Continue cooking, stirring the mixture occasionally so that it does
not stick to the pan.  In approximately 15 minutes, all of the plums
will be cooked through and mashed (my note: especially if you mash
'em as you stir).

Mash the mixture with a wooden spoon.  Put the mashed pulp through a
fine sieve, and continue mashing until all of the liquid and some of
the pulp go through (I used a food mill, ulp--different string, and I
used all the pulp).  Discard the pits and the skins.  They should be
about 4 quarts (4 liters) of liquid.  Boil the vinegar together with
the spices for a few minutes.  Add the vinegar-spice mixture to the
plum liquid, then boil vigorously, stirring constantly for 15
minutes, or until the liquid had reduced to 4 quarts again. Pour into
bottles or jars. Process. (Louis Szathmary, _American Gastronomy_).
