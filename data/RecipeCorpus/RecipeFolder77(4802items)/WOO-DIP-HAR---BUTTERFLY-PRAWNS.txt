Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
12 lg Prawns
1 tb Chinese wine or dry sherry,
-optional
2 tb Light soy sauce
1 sm Clove garlic, crushed
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Finely grated fresh ginger
1/2 c  Corn flour (I assume this is
-cornstarch?)
1 lg Egg, beaten
Breadcrumbs for coating
Peanut oil for deep frying
Shell and de-vein prawns, leaving tails on.  With a sharp knife slit
prawns along curve of back but do not cut right through. Combine
wine, soy sauce, garlic crushed with salt, ginger. Marinate prawns in
this mixture for 15 minutes.

Dip prawns into corn flour, shake off excess flour, then dip into
beaten egg and finally into breadcrumbs. Press gently to flatten
prawns and firm on the crumb coating.

Heat oil and fry prawns, 2 or 3 at a time, until golden brown, about 2
minutes.  Drain on absorbent paper and serve hot with chilli sauce if
desired.
