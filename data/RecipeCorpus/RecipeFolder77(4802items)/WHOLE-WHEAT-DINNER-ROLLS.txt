Title: WHOLE WHEAT DINNER ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  ;Water
3/4 c  Oil
1 1/2 tb Molasses
4 1/4 c  Flour
3 c  Flour, whole wheat
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
2 pk Yeast
2    Eggs
Heat water, oil and molasses to 120 to 130 degrees. Combine liquid
with two cups white flour, one cup whole wheat flour and remaining
ingredients. Beat four minutes at medium speed. With a wooden spoon,
stir in rest of whole wheat flour. Add remaining white flour until
you have a stiff dough. You usually won't use all of the white flour.
On a well-floured surface, knead the dough until smooth and elastic.
This takes about five minutes. Place in a greased bowl, cover and
rise until doubled (45 to 60 minutes). Grease three 8" round or
square cake pans (or one 13 x 9 and one 8"). Punch dough down. Shape
into 36 balls and arrange in the pans. Cover and rise until light and
doubled (30 to 45 minutes). Preheat oven to 375 and bake 15 to 20
minutes. If desired, brush with melted butter. Source: Pillsbury's
