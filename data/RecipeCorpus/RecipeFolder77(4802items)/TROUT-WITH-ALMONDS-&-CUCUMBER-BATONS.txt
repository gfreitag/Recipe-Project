Heat the oil in a large frying pan into which all the trout will fit
in one layer. Add the trout and saute gently for 3 minutes. Split the
cucumber lengthways, scoop out the seeds and cut across into slim
halfmoons about quarter-inch thick, Turn the trout over and saute for
another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and turn heat up until it
foams. Put in cucumber pieces, spread them around the pan, then add
the almonds. Saute them carefully until they start to turn golden,
then take the pan off the heat before the almonds can burn. Serve on
warm plates with a good measure of cucumber and almonds on each plate.
