Title: VUSHKA (LITTLE EAR DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Christmas, Russian, Breads
Yield: 10 Servings
2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 ts Salt
1 lg Egg Yolk
1/2 c  Evaporated Milk; OR
1/2 c  Whole Milk
1 ts Oil Or Mrlted Butter
Combine the flour and salt, blending well.  Add the milk, egg yolk,
and oil, again blending well.  Allow to rest for 5 minutes. Knead for
about minutes and form into a ball. (This may be done in a
processor.) Cover and set aside for 15 minutes or so.  On a floured
surface, roll out a third of the dough, into a rectangle 1/8th inch
thick. Turn the dough and roll from the center, so that all the dough
in the rectangle is even in thickness. Run a hand under the dough to
loosen it. Dust with flour and flip over and dust with flour.  With a
sharp knife, cut into 1 1/2-inch squares. Place a teaspoon of
mushroom filling (see the next recipe in this series) in each square,
being careful not to smear the edges.  Fold on the diagonal to make a
triangle.  Pinch together the two bottom corners, wrapping it around
your thumb with the point up (to resemble small ears on a cat),
making sure that the edges have bonded or the stuffing will boil out.
Place on cookie sheets covered with dish towels lightly dusted with
flour. Repeat with the other pieces of dough, saving the scraps for
last as the dough gets a little tougher when worked.  Drop 10 or 12
vushka into 6 to 8 cups of rapidly boiling water and stir once with a
wooden spoon, (The wooden spoon is very important as a metal one will
lower the temperature of the water.) Do NOT cover.  When they float
to the top, cook 1 minut, then remove with a slotted spoon to a
strainer. Cool on a lightly oiled plate without crowding.  Repeat
until all are cooked. Cover and set aside. These may be frozen and
then reheated in boiling water. (DO NOT overcook when reheating.)

TO SERVE:

Place 4 or 5 vushka in soup plates and pour hot borsch over them.
