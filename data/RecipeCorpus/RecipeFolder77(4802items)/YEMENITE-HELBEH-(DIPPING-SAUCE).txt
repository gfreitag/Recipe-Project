That's interesting - I have her "Jewish Holiday Kitchen" cookbook,
which also has a recipe for Zhug, but it was neither authentic nor
good. The following is the translation of a recipe given to me by a
Yemenite woman, who grows her own tiny peppers (I have no idea what
variety, but they are much hotter than seranos). One thing the
Yemenites do with it is make a "dipping sauce" (more of a spread,
actually) that is eaten with bread, called Helbeh.  This is adopted
from Joan Nathan's recipe:

1. Let the fenugreek seeds soak in water for several hours or
overnight.

2. Pour off any remaining liquid, leaving a moist paste.

3. Using a wooden spoon, whip in, little by little, up to 1/2 cup
water into the paste. Then mix in the zhug, lemon juice (JN calls for
1 tablespoon, or to taste), and the tomato (JN says to grate it, I
just mash it up).

4. Adjust seasonings to taste.  It should be very spicy. This can
either be eaten plain with bread (I would use pita), or served with a
meal like a chutney.
