Title: WIENER BACKHENDL  VIENNESE FRIED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
2    3 lb frying chickens
Lemon juice
Salt
Paprika
All-Purpose flour
2    Eggs
1 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Water
Dry breadcrumbs
Butter or margerine

Cut chicken into serving pieces.  Sprinkle with lemon juice; let
stand 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper; coat with flour. In
a small bowl, beat together eggs, oil, and water. Dip chicken pieces
in egg mixture until well coated.  Coat with breadcrumbs. Shake off
any excess breadcrumbs. Let chicken pieces stand 15 to 20 minutes
before frying. Melt enough butter or margerine in 1 or two large
skillets to make two inches of fat. Carefully place coated chicken
pieces in hot fat. Brown lightly on both sides. Reduce heat and cook
gently until tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from skillet with a
slotted spoon or kitchen tongs; drain on paper towels. Preheat oven
to 350F (175C). Arrange chicken in an open baking pan. Bake 10 to 15
minutes or until breadcrumb coating is very dry and crusty. Arrange
chicken on a warm serving dish. Garnish with parsley and lemon
wedges. Serve with a green salad and potatoes.
