Title: WINE COOLERS
Categories: Boat, Drinks, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
Wine
Fruit punch
Soda water
Ice
Buy some white wine that you like.  I like Italian Sparkling wines,
they are sweet and are already carbonated so you can make a stronger
cooler by cutting back on the water. Find two or three fruits you
like and squeeze out the juice. Add this juice to the wine and stir
it up. Pour in to cooler or suitable container already full of ice.
pour in the carbonated water and stir slowly.  Garnish with chunks of
fruit. Keep a lid on it to keep out the flies and keep in the
carbonation. BTW a real sangaree combines wine, brandy and water. Try
substituting a schnapps or brandy for the juice for a cooler with
more kick. Pretty basic stuff but its classier than Bartles and
Jaymes and you can make your own flavors like strawberry banana,
watermelon lime and so on.
