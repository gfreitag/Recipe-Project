consistancy of gravy. Add crushed garlicand salt to taste. Simmer an
additional 30 minutes. 	Seperate eggs.  Beat egg yolks and add
cracker crumbs. Beat egg whites until stiff, and fold in egg yolks.
Drop by tb into hot oil and brown on both sides. Drain on a paper
towel, and then add them to the red chile.

This dish was popular because the red chile was always available,
dried in ristras from the previous year's crop and the chickens were
laying eggs in plentiful numbers in the spring. Eggs were used in
place of meat during Lent because on certain days the church
prohibited eating meat.
