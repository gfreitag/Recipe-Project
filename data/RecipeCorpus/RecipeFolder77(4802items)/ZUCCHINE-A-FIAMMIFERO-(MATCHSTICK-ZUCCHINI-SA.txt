Categories: Salads, Italian, Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
8 sm Zucchini, lightly steamed
1 tb Olive oil
1 lg Garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 tb Rosemary, minced
1 1/2 tb Sage leaves, minced
1 tb Lemon juice
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 ts Salt
Black pepper
Let the steamed zucchini cool.  Warm 1 tb olive oil in a small saute
pan over very low heat & add the garlic. Let it sweat so that the
flavour infuses the oil.  Add the rosemary & sage & let them wilt in
the oil for a minute or so. Cut the cooled zucchini into strips the
size of kitchen matchsticks & place them in the salad bowl. Whisk
together the lemon juice, 1/4 c olive oil, salt, pepper & garlic-herb
infused oil. Toss carefully, being extremely careful not damage the
fragile zucchini pieces. Serve at room temperature.
