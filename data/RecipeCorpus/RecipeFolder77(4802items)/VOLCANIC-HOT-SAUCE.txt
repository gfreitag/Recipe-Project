Title: VOLCANIC HOT SAUCE
Categories: Condiment, Jamaican, Caribbean
Yield: 2 Cups
10-12 scotch bonnets or
Habanero, serrano, jalapeno
6 cl Garlic, peeled and chopped
1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
1/3 c  Distilled white vinegar
2 tb Dijon style mustard
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Molasses
1/2 ts Turmeric
1 tb Salt or to taste
Combine the pepper, garlic, lime juice, vinegar, mustard, oil,
molasses, turmeric, and slat in a blender and puree until smooth.
Correct the seasoning, adding more salt or molasses to taste.

Transfer the sauce to a clean bottle.  You can use it right away, but
the flavor will improve if you let it age for a few days. Volcanic
Hot Sauce will keep almost indefinitely, refrigerated or at room
temperature. Just give it a good shake before using.
