Prepare the manicotti according to package directions. Gently drain
and rinse the noodles.

Preheat the oven to 350 F degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the mashed tofu, garlic, soy

Line a 9 x 13-inch pan with 2 cups of the spaghetti sauce. Gently

spaghetti sauce. Pour the remaining sauce over the stuffed noodles.
Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minute, or
until the sauce bubbles.
