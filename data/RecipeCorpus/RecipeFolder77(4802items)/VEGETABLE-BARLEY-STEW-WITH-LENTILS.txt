with the vegetable oil.  Add the onion and carrots. Saute, stirring
constantly, for 3 minutes. Stir in the lentils, bay leaf, ginger,
dried herbs, and remaining 2 cups water.  Bring the mixture to a
boil, cover, and reduce the heat to low.  Simmer for about 20
minutes, until the lentils are tender. Add the V8 juice, zucchini,
peppers, celery, and tomato to the pot. Cook over low heat until the
vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Pour in the barley and its
cooking liquid. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic, and soy sauce.  Cook
for 10 minutes more to thicken the stew. Garnish with the chopped
parsley.
