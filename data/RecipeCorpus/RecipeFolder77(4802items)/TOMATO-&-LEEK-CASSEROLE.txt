Title: TOMATO & LEEK CASSEROLE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
5    Or 6 large leeks
2 lb Firm tomatoes
x  Ff grated cheese (amount
Optional according to
Taste)
x  Bread crumbs
x  Red wine vinegar
x  Marjoram, thyme, sage,
Pepper, rosemary
Slice leeks and tomatoes.  Layer in casserole dish (leeks on the
bottom so the juice from the tomatoes helps cook them
:).  Sprinkle with red wine vinegar. Add cheese. Add layer of bread
crumbs. Spice according to taste. (Repeat layer if desired). Cook at
375 until bread crumbs are golden.

The amounts of ingredients in this one can be varied. Some ppl prefer
more tomatoes, while I am allergic to them so tend to skimp there
:)  The lack of cooking time is due to the origination of the recipe.
I learned it in Holland and the oven temps there are far different
from here. We usually made it in some old nearly broken down toaster
oven so the time varied with each attempt
:)  I have found many non vegan friends love this recipe.
