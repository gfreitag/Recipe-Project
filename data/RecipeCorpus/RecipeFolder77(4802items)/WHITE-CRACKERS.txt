Recipe by: The Fannie Farmer Cookbook Preheat oven to 425F. Use
ungreased cookie sheets. Combine flour, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt
in a mixing bowl.  Stir the dry ingredients to blend well. Cut the
butter into small pieces and add the the dry mixture. Using either
your fingertips or a pastry cutter, cut the bits of butter into the
dry mixture until it looks like fine crumbs.  Slowly stir in the
milk, adding enough so the dough pulls away from the sides of the
bowl. Add a few drops more if the dough seems dry -- it should be
soft and pliable, not wet and sticky. Divide the dough in half.
Lightly dust a surface with flour. Roll each half out to a square
approximately 13 x 13 inches and thinner than 1/8 inch. Trim the
uneven edges and lift the dough onto the cookie sheet, or roll over a
rolling pin and unroll onto the cookie sheet. use a sharp knife to
score the dough into 2-inch squares, cutting almost through the
dough. Bake 6-8 minutes, or until the edges are slightly golden.
Remove from the oven and with a large spatula loosen the squares and
turn them over. Return to the oven and bake for another 5-6 minutes,
or until the edges are well browned. remove from the oven and slide
the sheet onto racks to cool. Break the crackrs apart when cool and
store in an airtight container. these will keep for weeks and taste
fresh.

Makes 5-dozen 2-inch crackers.
