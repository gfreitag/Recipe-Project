1    Egg white
1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
1 ts Water
In small mixer bowl, beat 2 egg whites until soft peaks form (tips
curl over).  Gradually beat in the 1 cup of superfine sugar, beating
until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight up). Stir together nuts,
flour, and spices; fold in beaten egg whites.  Let mixture rest 30
minutes or longer so nuts can absorb mixture. Roll out to 1/4-inch
thickness on surface lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Cut with
star-shapped cookie cutter(*). Place on greased baking sheet. Bake in
325øF oven for 10 - 15 minutes. Cool on rack. (*) Dough scraps may be
rerolled to 1/2-inch thickness and cut with scalloped cutter.  Bake
in 325øF oven for 20 minutes. Store in covered container.

ICING: Beat 1 egg white slightly. Gradually stir in the remaining 1
1/2 c confectioner's sugar.  Add water till icing is of spreading
consistency.
