Preheat oven to 325 F.  Line a 13 x 9 x2 pan with foil, including
sides and lightly grease.

Melt butter and chocolate in microwave or double boiler over low heat
until mixture is smooth, stirring often. Remove from heat and stir in
sugar and vanilla.

Beat eggs lightly and add to chocolate mixture.  Stir well. (Mixture
may appear curdled, but that's ok.  ) Add flour and nuts and stir
just to combine.  Transfer batter to pan and bake 30 - 35 minutes or
until pale golden.

Cool completely and left out of pan with foil; peel away foil and cut
into squares.
