Yield: 6 Sandwiches
1/2    Loaf day-old whitebread;
-unsliced, homemade-type
10    Anchovy fillets, finely
-chopped
4 tb Butter; softened
2 tb Dijon mustard

1/4 c  Dill, parsley & chives;

1/8 ts Black pepper; fresh ground

Trim the crusts from the load of bread and cut into 12 slices 1/8"
thick. In a small bowl, mash together the chopped anchovies, butter,
mustard, eggs, herbs and pepper. The mixture should be quite smooth.
Thickly spread it on 6 slices of bread. Top each slice with another
piece of bread and lightly press them together. At this point, the
sandwiches may be wrapped in wax paper and refrigerated for up to 3
days or even frozen (they should be thoroughly defrosted before
using). Over moderate heat, melt the butter and oil in a 10-12"
skillet. When the foam subsides, add the sanwiches, 2 or 3 at a time,
and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until they are crisp and
golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve while hot either whole
as a main luncheon course or snack, or cut in quarters to accompany
cocktails. Makes 6 sandwiches or 24 hors d'oeurve
