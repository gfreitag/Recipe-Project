Here's a salsa recipe I've been playing around with for about a month
or so. Originally, I wanted to "wrap" a salsa around a core of nuoc
cham, with a hint of a Cajun hot sauce thrown in for good measure.
The end result was a bit of a hybrid, but it seems to have worked out
fairly well. Anyway, enjoy--it's a hot one!

Peel (if necessary) and coarsely chop the tomatoes. Place in a
saucepan. Add coarsely chopped onion, celery, and jalapenos. Peel and
finely dice the garlic, add half now and reserve the other half.

Grind the cumin seed and add it along with the nuoc mam, vinegar,
worcestershire, paprika, ground red pepper, and three tablespoons of
sugar. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce to a moderate simmer, and cook
for 25-30 minutes, or until desired thickness is achieved.

Now, about 5 minutes before the salsa is done, fry the reserved
garlic in a little oil until it is crispy and golden. Remove the
salsa from heat, add the fried garlic with one tablespoon of sugar,
and stir occasionally until the salsa cools (stops steaming).

This should keep for between 1 and 2 weeks at 40 degrees F. The recipe
makes between 1.5 and 2 quarts of salsa.
