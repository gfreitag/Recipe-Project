Title: WES 'N' KATHY'S AUTHENTIC ORIGINAL LIMA BEAN
Categories: Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
12 oz Dried (large) lima beans or
-butterbeans
1    Med. onion (chopped)
2    Ribs celery, including tops
1 lg Carrot (diced)
4 c  Ham stock
1/4 lb Diced ham
2 c  Water
1    Chili pepin (crushed)
2    Cloves garlic (minced)
We invented this yesterday, and are still munching on it. I wanted a
plain plate of butterbeans for my birthday, but Kathy can never do
anything 1/2 way.

Salt & black pepper to taste

Place all ingredients except salt and pepper in a pot. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat.  Cover pot and simmer until beans are VERY tender
(3 to 4 hours).  Salt & pepper to taste. Serve this with bread &
butter, garlic bread, or dinner rolls.  Makes a complete meal. Enjoy!
