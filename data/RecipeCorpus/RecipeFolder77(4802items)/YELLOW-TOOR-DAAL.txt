'Daal' refers to a variety of lentils, peas and beans that are used
to make soups and stews also known as 'daal'. This recipe calls for
'toor daal', split yellow pigeon peas, but you can substitute mung
beans or red lentils. Vaghar, the method used here to saute spices in
oil is a basic Gujarati cooking technique used in making most dishes.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Cover daal with water and soak 30 minutes. If
using a pressure cooker, reduce soaking time to 10 minutes. Discard
soaking water in a large saucepan or pressure cooker. Cook 50 minutes
by conventional method or 15 minutes in a pressure cooker. If using
red lentils, cook 30 minutes by conventional method or 10 minutes in
pressure cooker. For a souplike consistency, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more
water if needed. Puree daal with a handheld electric blender or in a
food processor.

Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add cumin seeds and
asafetida.  Cook until cumin seeds turn golden brown, about 1 minute.
Add to the daal and bring to a boil.

Stir in chilies, salt, sugar, turmeric and tomatoes. Lower heat and
simmer uncovered 5 minutes.  Remove daal from heat. Stir in cilantro
and yogurt or lemon juice and serve immediately.
