The Palace Cafe, located on New Orleans' Canal Street in the old
Werlein's Building, is the newest restaurant from the Brennan family,
who also operate some of the City's finest restaurants: Commander's
Palace, Mr. B's Bistro and Bacco. This dessert has become extremely
popular, and has practically become The Palace Cafe's signature
dessert.

You will absolutely slay your guests if you make this. I've had dinner
guests describe this dessert as "orgasmic", and "the best dessert
I've ever had".

Heat the cream in a double boiler and add the white chocolate; when
the chocolate is melted, remove from heat.

In a double boiler, heat the milk, sugar, eggs and egg yolks until
warm. Blend the egg mixture into the cream and chocolate mixture.

Place the bread slices in a baking pan. Pour 1/2 of the mixture over
the bread and let settle for a while, making sure the bread soaks up
all the mixture. Top with the rest of the mixture. Cover with
aluminum foil and bake at 275 degrees for 1 hour. Remove the foil and
bake for an additional 15 minutes until the top is golden brown.

For the sauce: Gently melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.
Remove from heat and mix in heavy cream. Spoon over bread pudding.
