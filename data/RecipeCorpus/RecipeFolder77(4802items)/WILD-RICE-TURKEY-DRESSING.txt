Title: WILD RICE TURKEY DRESSING
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Pkg
4 ts Chicken boullion
1 c  Chopped celery
1/2 c  Chopped green pepper
2 ts Poultry seasoning
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Hot water
8 oz Pkg
12 lb Turkey
Salt & pepper -- to taste
Wild rice
Herb seasoned stuffing mix
Cook rice as package directs, disolving 3 tsp boullion in water before
adding rice.  In a medium skillet cook celery & pepper untilnearly
done. Disolve remaining boullion in the cup of hot water. In a large
bowl combine rice, vegetables, boullion liquid, stuffing mix and
poultry seasoning. Mix well and stuff bird.

(I usually add some onions to the celery & pepper too and I like my
dressing a little more moist so I add more water)
