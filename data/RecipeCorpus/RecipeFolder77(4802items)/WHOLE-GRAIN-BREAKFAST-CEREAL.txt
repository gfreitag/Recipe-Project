Title: WHOLE-GRAIN BREAKFAST CEREAL
Categories: Breakfast, Digest
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Whole wheat berries
1 c  Whole rye berries
1 c  Whole triticale
1 c  Whole barley
1 c  Brown rice
1 c  Buckwheat groats
1 c  Millet
1 c  Sesame seeds
1 c  Flaxseed
1 c  Lentils
10 c  Oat groats
I mix it up, then cook a pot of it by measuring 2 cups of cereal to 5
cups of water, bringing it to boil, & then letting it sit over night.
Then I have a bowlful each morning, heated in the microwave until the
cooked cereal is gone and I need to make more. Or you could do the
same with a smaller amount, for one serving, say, try 1/4 cup of
cereal. It's very chewy and satisfying. And of course lots of whole
grains. Sometimes I just use oatmeal instead of oat groats, since
they are difficult to find and I like the consistency that oatmeal
adds. In the book he has a little paragraph about each grain,
explaining what vitamins/minerals it has & what it's good for.
