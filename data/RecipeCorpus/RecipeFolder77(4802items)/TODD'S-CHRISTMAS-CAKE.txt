Title: TODD'S CHRISTMAS CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Dates
1 c  Cherries
1 c  Walnuts
2/3 c  Chocolate Chips
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Flour
3 lg Eggs
Whips eggs well.  Add flour, sugar, salt and baking powder to large
bowl and mix well.  Mix in the goodies. Lick bowl! Place in 8x3x4
cake pan. If you use pan, line it with wax paper. I use tin foil.
It's much easier to wrap as a gift. Bake at 325 for 1 1/2 hours. Use
a toothpick to see if done.  You should not get anything but
chocolate. There should be a good crust and be brown. Make sure not
too soft in the middle.
