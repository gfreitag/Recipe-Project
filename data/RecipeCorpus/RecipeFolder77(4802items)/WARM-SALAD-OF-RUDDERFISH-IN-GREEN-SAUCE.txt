Stephen Ceideburg
200 ml Extra-virgin olive oil
70 ml Lemon juice
2    Cloves garlic, chopped
1    Handful parsley
1 sm Capsicum, chopped
3    Green onions, chopped
1 tb Capers
Salt and pepper to taste
500 g  To 600 g rudderfish
Admittedly, it is not salad weather but this is a particularly hearty
one and makes an appetising first course or lunch dish.

In a food processor or blender. process together 200 ml extra- virgin
olive oil, 70 ml lemon juice, 2 cloves garlic. chopped, a generous
handful of parsley, one small or half a large green capsicum,
chopped, 3 green (spring) onions, roughly chopped, 1 tablespoon
capers and salt and pepper to taste. The sauce should be thick - if
necessary add more of the green ingredients. Poach 500-600 g
rudderfish gently, preferably in fish stock but at a pinch in water
with a little lemon juice, just until the fish flakes. Remove from
the poaching liquid and dry with paper towels. While the fish is
still quite hot, break it into fairly large chunks, pour the sauce
over it and turn over gently to coat. Serve the salad as it is or on
a layer of still-warm sliced new potatoes.
