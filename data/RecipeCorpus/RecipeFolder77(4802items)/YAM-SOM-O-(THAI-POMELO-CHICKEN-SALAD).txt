It's almost Chinese New Year and the stores are all stocking up on
fresh fruits which are a traditional Chinese gift for the season.
Pomelos are a big citrus fruit much like grapefruit, but somewhat
drier and sweeter. This Thai recipe makes use of them and you should
be able to find them this time of year.  If not grapefruit will do.
This is from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 1/30/91, by
Joyce Jue.

Peel and separate pomelo or grapefruit into segments. Remove the
membranes. Seed.  Gently flake the flesh apart into a bowl. Chill.
Hand shred the chicken. Add chicken and shrimp to pomelo.

In a small bowl mix together the chopped red chile with fish sauce,
sugar, lime juice and coriander; toss with pomelo chicken mixture.

Arrange the lettuce on a serving platter.  Put the fruit mixture over
the lettuce.  Top with peanuts and 2 tablespoons of Crisp Fried
Shallot Flakes, and garnish with red chile slivers.

Serves 4 to 6 as a salad entree.

CRISP FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES: Slice shallots into thin slices. Be sure
they are all of the same thinness to ensure even cooking. Heat a pan
with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add shallots and fry slowly
until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. The moisture in the
shallots should be completely cooked out. Drain on paper towel. Store
in an air-tight container.  Will keep several weeks.
