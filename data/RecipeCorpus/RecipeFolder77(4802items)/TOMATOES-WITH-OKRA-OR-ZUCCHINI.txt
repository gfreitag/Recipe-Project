Categories: Vegetables, Canning
Yield: 1 Text  Quantity: An average of 12 pounds of tomatoes and 4 pounds of okra or
zucchini is needed per canner load of 7 quarts. An average of 7
pounds of tomatoes and 2-1/2 pounds of okra or zucchini is needed per

Procedure: Wash tomatoes and okra or zucchini. Dip tomatoes in boiling
water 30 to 60 seconds or until skins split. Then dip in cold water,
slip off skins and remove cores, and quarter. Trim stems from okra
and slice into 1-inch pieces or leave whole. Slice or cube zucchini
if used. Bring tomatoes to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Add okra or
zucchini and boil gently 5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of salt for each
quart to the jars, if desired. Fill jars with mixture, leaving 1-inch
headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations
in Table 1 or Table 2, depending on the method of canning used.

Variation: You may add four or five pearl onions or two onion slices
to each jar.
