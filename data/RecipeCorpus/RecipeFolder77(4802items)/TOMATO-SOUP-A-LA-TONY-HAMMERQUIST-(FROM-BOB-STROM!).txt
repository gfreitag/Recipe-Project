Title: TOMATO SOUP A LA TONY HAMMERQUIST (FROM BOB STROM!)
Categories: Cyberealm, Misc.stuff
Yield: 1 Lg pot  Text only:

"This is an interesting mix that may prove valuable in the event that
you or a loved one comes across a black creature with a white stripe
up it's back!

In a LARGE pot, fill three quarters full with tomato juice.

Insert 1 dog, being certain that the pot is big enough... but not TOO
big!

Add one quarter of lemon juice, six ounces of Tabasco sauce, four
tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste.

Simmer on no heat until the smell is gone. HINT: It's done when the
dog's tongue turns SMOKEY!

Flush the juice down the drain, because the City Sewage Treatment
plant needs the nutrients to work properly. Wash off the dog with a
mixture of soap, warm water and Pinesol, and you're done! All that is
left is to clean up the dishes.. the real fun part!"
