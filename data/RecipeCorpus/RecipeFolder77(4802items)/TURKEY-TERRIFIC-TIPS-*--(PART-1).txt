MMMMM-----------------HOW TO DO A PERFECT TURKEY----------------------
THAWING TURKEY: 1). Thaw in original bag on tray in refrigerator for
3-4 days (24 hours for each 5 lbs).
2). For faster thawing, cover turkey in original bag with cold water
and change the water frequently (30 minutes per pound).
3). After turkey is thawed, remove the neck and giblets stored
inside the turkey. Wash turkey, inside and out; drain well.
4). Store fresh thawed turkey in refrigerator no longer than 2 days
before cooking it.
5). Always wash hands, utensils, sink, dishcloths and anything that
touches the raw turkey with very hot, soapy water to avoid
contaminating other food with bacteria.

PREPARING & STUFFING THE BIRD: 1). Rub the cavity of the turkey
lightly with salt, if desired, but do not salt the cavity if the
turkey is to be stuffed.
2). Stuff turkey just before roasting, not ahead of time! 3). Dry
stuffing ingredients can be mixed ahead of time if tightly covered.
Toss moist ingredients just before stuffing.
4). Fill wishbone area with stuffing first. Fasten neck skin to back
with skewer.
5). Fold wings across back with tips touching.
6). Stuffing expands as it cooks, so stuff body cavity lightly.
7). Tuck drumsticks under band of skin or tail, or tie skewer to
tail.

ROASTING TIPS: 1). Place turkey, breast side up, on rack in shallow
roasting pan. Roast in 325~ oven.
2). Use tent of foil over turkey when it begins to turn golden brown.
3). If using a dark covered enamel pan, roast covered. Remove lid
during last 1/2 hour if further browning is desired.
4). When turkey is 2/3's done, remove skewer or band holding legs.
5). Using a meat thermometer is the best way to insure doneness. When
placed in the thickest part of inside thigh muscle or the thickest
part of breast meat, it should read 185~ when done. (Thermometer
should not touch bone.) 6). When turkey is done, let stand 20 minutes
for easiest carving.
