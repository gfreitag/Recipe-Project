Title: WHOLE-GRAIN MUSTARD
Categories: Sauces, Seasonings
Yield: 1 Cup
1 tb Whole coriander seeds
6 tb Whole mustard seeds
-(mixture of black & yellow)
1 tb Green peppercorns
1/2 ts Dried thyme
3/4 c  Water
2 ts Honey
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
Toast coriander seeds in a dry skillet or place them in a flat dish
and microwave on High for 4 to 5 minutes. Crush mustard seeds, green
peppercorns, and coriander seeds in a mortar.

Mix the crushed seeds, thyme, and water in the upper pan of a glass,
enamel, or stainless steel double boiler and let stand at least three
hours.

Heat water to boiling in the lower pan of the double boiler. Reduce
the heat to simmering and place the upper pan, containing the mustard
mixture on top. Stir in the honey and vinegar and cook 10 minutes
until the mustard is as thick as you like.  It will thicken a bit
more as it cools. Refrigerate, covered.
