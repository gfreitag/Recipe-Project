MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
Ground cinnamon
Confectioners' sugar; sifted
Place the rice in boiling water and leave for 5 seconds; drain, and
rinse. Bring the milk almost to a boil in a heavy saucepan, and stir
in the rice, the first quantity of sugar, the orange zest, salt, and
butter. Reduce the heat to very low and simmer uncovered, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking, for 1 hour, or until thick and
creamy. Remove from the heat and set aside.

Whisk together the egg, vanilla, lemon juice, and remaining sugar
until pale and thick, about 2 minutes. Remove the orange zest from
the rice mixture and stir half the rice into the egg mixture. Return
this to the saucepan and stir to combine.  Gently cook over low heat,
stirring well, for 2 minutes.  Stir in the Rich Cream and add more
sugar or lemon juice if desired.  (If using heavy cream, beat until
slightly thickened, then stir into the rice mixture.)   Divide among
individual dishes and chill.

To serve, liberally dust with the cinnamon and confectioners' sugar.
