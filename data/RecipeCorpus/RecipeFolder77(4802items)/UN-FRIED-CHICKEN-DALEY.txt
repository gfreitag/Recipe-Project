Categories: Chicken
Yield: 12 Servings
Light Vegetable Oil Spray
6    Chicken drumsticks --
Skinless
3    Chicken breast -- halved,
Skin removed
3 1/2 c  Ice Water  *
1 c  Yogurt -- plain nonfat
FOR THE BREADING-----
1 c  Italian bread crumbs --
Dried
1 c  Flour -- all-purpose
1 tb Old Bay Seasoning
1/2 ts Garlic Powder
1/2 ts Creole Seasoning
1/8 ts Fresh ground black pepper
ds Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Thyme -- dried
1/2 ts Basil -- dried
1/2 ts Oregano -- dried
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Coat a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegetable oil.

Put the chicken in a large bowl with ice water.  Put the yogurt into a
medium bowl. Set both bowls aside.

* The secret to the success of this recipe is to make sure that both
the chicken and the yogurt are very cold (hence, soaking the chicken
in the ice water). The preliminary soaking will help the breading
adhere and produce a crisp coating much like that of fried chicken.

Toss all the breading ingredients into a large, tightly-sealing
plastic bag. Seal and shake well to mix.

Remove 2 pieces of chicken from the ice water.  Roll each piece in the
yogurt.  Put the chicken into the plastic bag, reseal, and shake to
coat thoroughly. Transfer the breaded chicken to the prepared baking
sheet. Repeat the process until all 12 pieces are breaded. Spray the
chicken lightly with the vegetable oil.

Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 1
hour, turning the pieces every 20 minutes to allow even browning.

Serve hot or at room temperature.
