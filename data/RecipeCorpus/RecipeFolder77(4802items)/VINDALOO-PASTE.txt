Title: VINDALOO PASTE
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Cayenne
4 tb Cumin
2 tb Turmeric
2 tb Black pepper
2 tb Hot mustard powder
2 tb Salt
2 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Cinnamon
3/4 c  White vinegar
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
From this you can "vindaloo" anything you want chicken, beef, pork,
tofu, or just plains veggies.
Place all the spices and the salt in a mixing bowl and stir in the
vinegar. Keep blending with a spoon until a paste is formed. Heat the
oil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat and add the paste. Reduce
the heat immediately to low and stir steadily and vigorously,
scraping the bottom of the saucepan to make sure the spices do not
stick or burn. (Don't put your face over the pan, as the pungent
vapors from the spices witll make your eyes water.)  Stir constantly
for about 8 minutes, or until the spices have cooked and mellowed and
the oilis exuded from the mixture to the edges of the pan. Set aside
to cool. When the mixture has cooled, spoon it into a jar, complete
with any oil, and cap tightly. The paste will keep indefinitely in
the refrigerator and, if the jar has been sterilized, will keep for
at least 6 months on the shelf. Use 1 tablespoon to every 1.5 pounds
of meat (more if you like it spicy.) Norma Wrenn
