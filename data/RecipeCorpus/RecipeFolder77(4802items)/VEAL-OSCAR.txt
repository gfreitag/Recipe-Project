6    Veal cutlets; pound 1/4"
1    Egg; slightly beaten
1 tb Water
2/3 c  Dry bread crumbs
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 c  All purpose flour
2 tb Margarine/butter
2 tb Vegetable oil
10 oz Frozen aspargus spears
Lump crabmeat
HOLLANDAISE SAUCE
3    Egg yolks
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Firm butter
Mix egg and water. Mix bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Coat veal with
flour. Dip veal into egg mixture; coat with bread crumb mixture. Heat
1 tb of the margarine and 1 tb of the oil in 10" skillet over medium
heat until hot. Cook half of the cutlets in margarine mixture,
turning once, until done, about 10 minutes. Remove veal; keep warm.
Repeat with remaing margarine, oil and veal. Cook asparagus as
directed on package; drain. Prepare Hollandaise Sauce. Place 3 to 4
asparagus spears on top of each cutlet; add some crabmeat and spoon
sauce over top. HOLLANDAISE SAUCE: Stir egg yolks and lemon juice
vigorously in 1 1/2-qt saucepan. Add 1/4 c of the butter. Heat over
very low heat, stirring constantly, until butter is melted. Add
remaining butter. Continue stirring vigorously until butter is melted
and sauce is thickened. (Be sure butter melts slowly as this gives
eggs time to cook

and thicken sauce without curdling) Lisa FROM: LISA HLAVATY (FDGN81A)
