Title: TOFU BACON
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-==========
Ingredients:

firm Tofu, cut into strips shaped like bacon 2 tblsp
1 lb
nutritional yeast 2 tblsp tamari/shoyu 1 tsp Wright's (or other
brand) liquid smoke. 1 tblsp  oil (something neutral, not olive or
sesame) Fry tofu strips on low or medium heat until they are crispy
on the outside. The best way to do this is to lay them in the pan in
the oil and let them sit for at least 10 minutes, simmering.  They
should turn easily after that. Turn them and give them another 10
minutes on the other side.

Mix the tamari/shoyu soy sauce with the liquid smoke first, then take
the pan off the heat.  Pour the liquid smoke/tamari into the pan and
stir the tofu so all sides are coated, then sprinkle the yeast over
all, stir some more, over the heat, until the liquid is gone and the
tofu is covered with sticky yeast.

Try it.  It tastes EXACTLY like bacon.

Another variation is to marinate the tofu in the tamari/liquid smoke
mixture for several hours and then fry, but it misses a little bit
without the nutritional yeast. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
