Make the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat
to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-2 1/2-inch
round springform pan. Line the bottom of the pan with a round of
parchment or waxed paper and butter the paper.

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the
chocolates, sugar and coffee for 15 to 20 seconds until finely
ground. With the motor of the food processor running, pour the
boiling water through the feed tube. Process for 10 to 15 seconds,
until the chocolate is completely melted. Using a spatula, scrape
down the sides of the work bowl. Add the butter and process for about
5 seconds, or until incorporated. Add the eggs and vanilla and
process for about 5 seconds, just until the mixture is smooth and
creamy. Scrape the chocolate batter into the prepared pan and smooth
the top with a rubber spatula.

Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until the edges of the cake are puffy and
the center is just set. Cool the cake in the pan set on a wire rack
for 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate forat least 3 hours, or until
ready to serve.

Make the raspberry coulis: In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen
raspberries and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the
berries are soft. Do not let the mixture boil. Strain the
raspberrymixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Stir in the
raspberry liqueur. Cover and refrigerate.

Decorate the chocolate cake: Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge
of the cake to loosen it from the sides of the springform pan. Remove
the side of the springform pan. Invert the cake onto a serving plate.
Peel off the paper. Refrigerate the cake while you prepare the
whipped cream.

In a chilled large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at medium
speed, beat the cream with the sugar and vanilla just until stiff
peaks begin to form.

Using an offset metal cake spatula, spread a thin even layer of
whipped cream over the top of the chocolate cake. Fill a pastry bag
fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #6) withthe remaining whipped
cream. Completely cover the top of the cake with whipped cream
rosettes.

To serve, drizzle some of the raspberry coulis onto each dessert
plate. With a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the cake, wiping the
blade clean between each slice. Place the slices on the dessert
plates, and garnish with fresh raspberries if desired.
