Categories: Chinese, Soups/stews
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Peanut oil
4    Green onions, minced
1/2 ts Fresh ginger root, minced
3 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Canned cream-style corn
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
1 ts Sugar
1 tb Dry sherry
1/2 ts MSG (opt)
2 tb Cornstarch and
1/8 c  Stock for cornstarch paste
2    Egg whites
1 tb Cooked Smithfield (or
Hickory-smoked) ham, minced
Wash corn in stock.  Drain corn, reserving stock; chop finely and
return to stock.  In a cup, mix cornstarch and cold stock to make
paste.

In heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat oil until hot.  Saute green onions &
ginger for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly to avoid burning.
Add stock & corn; stir & bring to just under boil. Add salt, pepper &
sugar. Simmer 15 minutes or until ready to serve. Just before
serving, turn up heat again to a bubbly boil. Dribble in cornstarch
paste until soup acquires a waxy translucence.  It should still be
thin, but not watery. Add sherry. Now beat egg white with a fork to a
light froth. Turn off heat. Quickly swirl in egg whites. Pour into
serving bowl. Garnish with ham. Serve.
