Title: TRUFFLED MASHED POTATOES-MARTHA STEWART LIVIN
Categories: Sides, Vegetables, Potatoes, Soup/stews
Yield: 2 Servings
4    Yukon Gold potatoes (about
-2 lb)
Salt
1 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Hot milk, or more as needed
Freshly ground pepper
1 ts White-truffle oil
1. Place whole unpeeled potatoes in a saucepan of cold water. Add
salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender when
pierced with the tip of a small knife, about 40 minutes. Drain.

2. When cool enough to handle, peel potatoes and put through a ricer
or food mill on the finest blade. Beat in butter with a wooden spoon.
Beat in hot milk little by little until a smooth, creamy consistency
is achieved. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (If making ahead
of time, keep in a heatproof bowl, covered with aluminum foil, set
over a pot of hot water. When ready to serve, reheat over simmering
water. You may need to add additional hot milk to thin.)

3. Just before serving, whisk 1/2 t of the truffle oil into the
potatoes. After dishing out potatoes, make a little well in each
serving and drizzle=7F
1/4 t  oil on top.
