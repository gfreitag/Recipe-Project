Title: YORK PEPPERMINT PATTIE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Egg white
4 c  Powdered sugar
1/3 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 ts Peppermint oil or extract
Cornstarch for dusting
1    Bag semisweet chocolate
Chips (16-ounce)
1.  In a medium bowl, beat the egg white until it is tiff and forms
peaks. Don't use a plastic bowl for this. 2. Slowly add the powdered
sugar while blending with an electric mixer set on medium speed. 3.
Add the corn syrup and peppermint oil or extract and knead the
mixture with your hands until is has the smooth consistency of dough.
4. Using a surface and rolling pin lightly dusted with cornstarch,
roll out the peppermint dough 1/4-inch thick. 5. Punch out circles of
peppermint dough with a biscuit cutter or a clean can with a diameter
of about 2 1/2-inches. Make approximately 20, place them on plates or
cookie sheets, and let them firm up in the refrigerator, about 45
minutes. 6. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave set on high for 2
minutes. Stir halfway through the heating time. Melt thoroughly, but
do not overheat. 7. Drop each patty into the chocolate and coat
completely. Using 2 forks, one in each hand, lift the coated patty
from the chocolate.  Gently tap the forks against the bowl to knock
off the excess chocolate and place each patty on waxed paper. 8.
Chill the peppermint patties until firm, about 30 minutes. Makes 20
peppermint patties.
