Title: WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE-HOME MADE & RECIPE FOR W
Categories: Ron's, Sauces, British
Yield: 1 1.5 litres
4    Shallots
1 l  Vinegar, good malt
90 ml Walnut Ketchup *See Recipe
75 ml Anchovy essence
60 ml Soy sauce
2 1/2 ml Cayenne pepper
Salt
Store bought Worcestershire Sauce is a little expensive if, like me,
you use a lot!  The following will yield 1 1/2 litres [2 1/4 British
Pints] and, in my opinion, is far tastier
:)   The Walnut Ketchup is also a tasty little sauce in it's own
right.

Worcestershire Sauce: Combine all the above in a clean bottle. Seal it
tightly. Shake several times a day for about 14 days. Strain into
small bottles, leaving some room in the neck. Seal tightly. Label and
store in a cool, dry place. Small bottles with plastic screw tops are
ideal as the vinegar will attack metal.

Walnut Ketchup: Walnut Ketchup is the base for many classic
sauces/ketchups. To make it you need green walnuts ie: gathered
before the shells harden!

400g onions, chopped. 2 litre malt vinegar. 200g salt. 25g whole
peppercorns. 15g whole allspice berries. 2.5ml whole cloves. 1.25ml
ground nutmeg. 10 green walnuts:

Put everything, except walnuts, into a preserving pan & bring to the
boil. Pop on some gloves to prevent staining & cut and crush the
walnuts. Pour the boiling liquid over the walnuts and leave for 14
days, stirring daily. Strain the liquid and simmer for 1 hour.
Bottle, label and store in a cool dry place.
