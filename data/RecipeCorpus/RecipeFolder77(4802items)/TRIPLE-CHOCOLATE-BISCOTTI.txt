10 1/2 oz All-purpose flour
3 1/2 oz Cocoa powder, Dutch process
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Instant espresso powder
4 oz Chocolate chips
5 lg Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
12 oz White chocolate
Heat oven to 325. Toast hazelnuts 10-15 min.  Put dry ingredients
(except nuts) down through espresso powder in bowl of elec. mixer.
Combine, then toss in nuts and choc. chips. In a separate bowl,
lightly whisk eggs and vanilla.  With mixer running on low, gradually
add egg mixture and mix until dough comes together. Dump dough on
lightly floured surface, divide into four parts, and with floured
hands, roll each part into a log about 10 in. long and 2 in. in
diameter. Place logs 4 in. apart on greased baking sheets.  Bake at
325 for 30-35 minutes, until sides are firm, tops are cracked. Reduce
oven to 300.  Let logs cool on baking sheet at least 10 min. before
slicing.  Cut logs on a slight diagonal into 3/4 in. slices. Place
biscotti flat on baking sheet and dry them in oven for about 25 min.,
until they offer resistance when pressed. Transfer to a rack to cool.

While they are cooling, melt white chocolate and spread on one cut
side of each biscotti.  Put them white-chocolate side down on a
parchment-lined baking sheet. Allow chocolate to harden. Peel
biscotti from parchment and enjoy.
