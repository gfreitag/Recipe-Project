tender. Add beans and water and bring to a simmer. Stir beans and stir
occasionally. Beans are done when they begin to clump together in one
mass. Season with salt and pepper.

Heat grill, broiler or cast iron grill pan and cook chicken breasts

slices, red onion, cheese, and cilantro on top of each tostado
(crisped tortilla) and serve immediately. Garnish with creamy salsa
and cilantro.
