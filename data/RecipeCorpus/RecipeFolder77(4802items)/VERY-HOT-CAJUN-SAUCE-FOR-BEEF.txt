Title: VERY HOT CAJUN SAUCE FOR BEEF
Categories: Cajun, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped green peppers
1/4 c  Chopped celery
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1/4 c  + 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
3/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Black pepper
2    Bay leaves
1/4 c  Minced jalapeno peppers(note
1 ts Minced garlic
3 c  Basic beef stock
NOTE: Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to use pickled ones,
rinse as much vinegar from them as possible. Combine the onions, bell
peppers and celery in a small bowl and set aside while you start the
roux. (NOTE: Unlike the roux in most other recipes in this book, the
roux we use here is light brown. Therefore, instead of heating the
oil to the smoking stage, we heat it to only 250F; this prevents the
roux from getting too brown.) In a heavy 2-quart saucepan heat the
oil over medium-low heat to about 250F. With a metal whisk, whisk in
the flour a little at a time until smooth. Continue cooking, whisking
constantly, until roux is light brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Be
carefyul not to let the roux scorch or splash on your skin.  Remove
from heat and with a spoon immediately stir in the vegtable mixture
and the red, white and black peppers; return pan to high heat and
cook about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the bay leaves,
jalapeno peppers and garlic, stirring well. Continue cooking about 2
minutes, stirring constantly.  (We're cooking the seasonings and
vegetables in the light roux and the mixture should, therefore, be
pasty.) Remove from heat.
In a separate 2-quart saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Add the
roux mixture by spoonfuls to the boiling stock, strirring until
dissolved between each addition. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce
heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce reduces to 3-1/2 cups,
about 15 minutes. Skim any oil from the top and serve immediately.
