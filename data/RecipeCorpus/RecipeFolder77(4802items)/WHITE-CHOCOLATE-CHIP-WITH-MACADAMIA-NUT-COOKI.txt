WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIP WITH MACADAMIA NUT COOKIES..... . This makes
about 8, so gather the following stuff:

Let's see...turn to page 97.......

Preheat oven to 375 F, and lightly grease 2 cookie sheets.

In a food processor using steel blade, blend butter, sugars, egg, and
vanilla until fluffy, stopping once to scrape the sides of the bowl,
about 1 minute.  Add flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until just
combined using 2 or 3 pulsed things; do not over-process. Transfer to
large bowl and stir in chocolate and nuts....

Mound dough by 1/3 cupfuls onto prepared cookie sheets, spacing about
2 inches apart.  Bake until light brown around the edges, about 15
minutes. Cool on the cookie sheets about 3 minutes. Transfer to rack
and cool completely.

You don't need me to tell you what to do next.........
