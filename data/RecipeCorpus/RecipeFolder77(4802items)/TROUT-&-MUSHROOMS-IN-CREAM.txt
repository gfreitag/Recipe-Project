Title: TROUT & MUSHROOMS IN CREAM
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
1/2 lb Small mushrooms (or large
Mushrooms, sliced)
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
4    Whole dressed trout (each
About 1/2 lb.)
All-purpose flour
1/4    Ts salt
2 tb Lemon juice
1/3 c  Whipping cream
In a wide frying pan, melt butter over medium-high heat; add
mushrooms and saute, stirring frequently, until golden and brown
(about 5 minutes). Stir in parsley, then remove pan from heat and
lift mushrooms from pan with slotted spoon.  Arrange evenly to cover
bottom of a large warm serving platter; keep warm. Set pan aside.

Wipe fish with damp cloth, inside cavities and outside. Coat fish
with flour; shake off excess. Arrange in single layer on wax paper
within reaching distance of range. Return pan to medium heat; add
salt to remaining butter.

Place in pan as many fish as will fit without crowding. Cook, turning
once, until fish is lightly browned and flakes readily when prodded
with a fork. For a 1-inch fish allow 10 minutes total - 5 minutes on
each side.

When fish is done, remove from pan and arrange on top of mushrooms;
keep warm. Repeat process with remaining fish.

After removing last fish, add lemon juice and cream to pan; bring to
a boil, stirring and scraping to blend with pan drippings. Spoon
immediately over fish and mushrooms and serve.
