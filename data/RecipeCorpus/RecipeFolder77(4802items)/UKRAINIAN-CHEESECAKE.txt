sieve and drain.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks until
light an foamy, then add the sugar slowly, continuing to beat until
very light and smooth.  Add the cottage cheese to the egg mixture,
blending well, then add the sour cream, cornstarch, lemon rind, and

hour.  Cool to room temperature before serving.
