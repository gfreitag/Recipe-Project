Serrated knife
Ziploc bag
Plate
4    Salad bowls
Spoon
Wash the tomatoes in cold water and with an adults help, cut into
half inch slices.

Place slices in plastic bag. Squeeze out any extra air and close the
bag tightly. Lay the bag on a clean plate placed in the sink. Now
make a fist and gently pound the tomato slices until they look
tortured.

Divide the tortured tomatoes among the four bowls and sprinkle with a
half tablespoon of crumbled cheese. Then, holding a spoon at least
12" from the salad bowl (to approximate the altitude of a low flying
bird), dribble a glob of dressing onto each one.
