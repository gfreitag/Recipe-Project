Title: VELVET FUDGE SOUFFLE
Categories: Desserts, Red wine
Yield: 16 Servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
6    Egg yolks
16 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 c  Chilled whipping cream
2 pk Unflavored gelatin
1 3/4 c  Sweet red wine
6    Egg whites
1/2 c  Sugar
Sweetened whipping cream
Extend height of 1-quart souffle dish 3 inches above dish with band of
double thickness aluminum foil; secure ends of foil by folding
together, taping or fastening with paper clips.
Mix 1/2 cup sugar, the gelatin, salt and wine in 2-quart saucepan.
Beat egg yolks slightly; stir yolks and chocolate chips into gelatin
mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until
mixture boils.
Chill pan in bowl of ice and water or refrigerator, stirring
occasionally, just until mixture mounds slightly when dropped from a
spoon, 20 or 30 minutes. Mixture should be slightly thicker than
unbeaten egg whites. If mixture becomes too thick, place pan in bowl
of hot water, stirring constantly, until mixture is of proper
consistency.
Beat egg whites until foamy in large mixer bowl. (Egg whites should
be at room temperature when beaten for best volume.) Gradually beat
in 1/2 cup sugar; beat until stiff and glossy. (Do not underbeat.)
Fold thickened gelatin mixture into meringue.
Beat 1 1/2 cups cream in chilled small mixer bowl until stiff; fold
into meringue mixture. Carefully turn into souffle dish. Refrigerate
until set, about 8 hours.
Just before serving, run knife around inside of foil band and remove
band. Garnish souffle with sweetened whipped cream.
