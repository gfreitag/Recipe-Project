*DIRECTIONS* Dissolve yeast in warm milk. Crumble in well so this
mixture is smooth. Combine flour, sugar, salt. Add warm evaporated
milk, melted butter and eggs. Now add the yeast mixture and mix well
together. Then knead this dough until smooth and handles well. Divide
dough into two parts. Roll out each part as thin as possible and
spread with honey nut filling.

We suggest that you prepare the filling before you make the dough, so
as to have it ready to spread on immediately, as you do not need to
have the dough rise before spreading on filling.

*=FILLING=-= INGREDIENTS* 1 lb. nut meats, ground 1/2 cup butter or
margerine, melted 1/2 cup evaporated milk, scalded 1/2 cup honey 1
egg, well beaten 1 cup sugar 2 cups yellow raisins (Sultanas) 1 tsp.
cinnamon

*DIRECTIONS* Pour scalded milk over nuts. Add sugar, honey and melted
butter. Mix well. When cool add beaten egg and cinnamon. Now spread
this mixture over rolled dough, sprinkle on the raisins. Roll up as
for jelly roll and set this aside in warm place to rise until double
in size. Bake in 350 F oven for 35 - 40 minutes. Before baking brush
over top with one egg beaten in with 1/2 cup milk, for golden crust.

*VARIATIONS*

Grandma uses pecans or English walnuts, and doesn't use raisins. When
she roll out the dough she then places it on a smooth towel so that
it will be easier to roll up the dough. Cover the potica while rising
with same towel.
