Prepare lasagna noodles. Bring water to boil in a large pot and add
pasta and olive oil. Return to a boil and simmer, stirring once or
twice to prevent sticking. Cook for time indicated on package for al
dente consistency. Drain, rinse thoroughly under cold water, and lay
out on clean towels. Cover with a towel to prevent drying.

Prepare ricotta. Crumble three-fourths of the tofu (12 oz) in a food
processor or blender. Add oil, salt and nutmet. Process only until
mixture is slightly lumpy. Finely crumble remaining tofu into mixture
and set aside.

Using 1 tablespoon of the garlic oil for each batch, cook zucchini in
a single layer in several batches, in a large skillet. Sprinkle each
batch of zucchini generously with basil, oregano, paprika, salt and
pepper. If the slices are thin enough, you will not need to turn
them. Saute until bright green and tender-crisp. Remove from skillet
and set aside.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon garlic oil to skillet. Toss in mushrooms
and saute until tender and slightly brown on edges. Remove from
skillet and set aside.

Steam spinach until defrosted. Squeeze to remove excess water and set
aside.

Preheat oven to 350. Lightly brush a shallow 9 x 13-inch baking dish
with olive oil. Place a scant ladle of spaghetti sauce in dish and
spread over bottom. Put a layer of 3 noodles on top of the sauce.
Cover with a thick masking or ricotta. Top with layers of zucchini,
mushrooms, spinach and salt and pepper to taste. Repeat layers of
spaghetti sauce, pasta, ricotta, zucchini, mushrooms, spinach and
seasonings twice more, reserving 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 to 3/4 cup
ricotta, and 2 tablespoons spaghetti sauce for final layer.

End with a final pasta layer, a masking of ricotta, and a thin
brushing of spaghetti sauce. Dust with basil, oregano and paprika.
Cover with foil. Bake 45 minutes, then cool a few minutes before
cutting. Serve hot.
