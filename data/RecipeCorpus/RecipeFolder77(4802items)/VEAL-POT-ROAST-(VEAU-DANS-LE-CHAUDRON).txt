Title: VEAL POT ROAST (VEAU DANS LE CHAUDRON)
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
3 tb Bacon fat or salad oil
2    Garlic cloves; cut in half
1    Veal - 1/2 leg or
3 or 4 lb rolled shoulder
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Thyme or
1/2 ts Savory
1    Bay leaf
6    Potatoes - medium (6-8)
6    Onions - medium (6-8)
Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2
cloves of garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place
the meat in the hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this
as the colour and flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how
well the meat has been browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay
leaf. Place the potatoes and onions, whole around the meat. Don't add
any liquid. Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till meat is
tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and onions will not break as
there is no liquid added. The veal will make its own gravy. When
cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter. Place the
pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another minute
or so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a complete meal.
