Title: TRADITIONAL BUTTERMILK BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  A.P. flour, sifted
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Soda
1 c  Buttermilk
4 tb Shortening
Sift flour, salt and soda together in a medium mixing bowl. Mix in
shortening with the tips of the fingers; add buttermilk and gently
knead into a soft ball of dough. Lift dough onto a well floured
board, knead just until smooth and firm enough to handle. Roll or pat
out to 1/2-inch thickness, and cut with floured cutter, or with knife
or the rim of smooth drinking glass.

Place biscuits on a greased cookie sheet, and bake in a pre-heated
400 F. oven for 10 min., until well browned.

Hint:  For biscuit cutters you may also use empty cans with holes
punched in bottoms to release air. #303 cans are perfect for large
biscuits, and tomato sauce cans (8 oz. size) are just right for small
ones.
