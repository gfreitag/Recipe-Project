breast side up in open roaster pan and cover with 2 strips thick
bacon. Brown in 475 degree oven until bacon is crisp. Take all fat
from pan and discard. Remove bacon. Add to the pan 1 onion,
quartered, 1 carrot, quartered, 1 cut up stalk of celery, 1 bay leaf,
2 or 3 sprigs of parsley, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 2 cans consomme with 2
cans water, and 1 cup of dry red wine. Cover the pan and roast at 375
degrees for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, basting often. Goose should be done so
that meat will readily pull off carcass. Remove goose from roaster

gravy and thicken with 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2
tablespoons cold water. Correct seasoning if necessary. Serve with
wild rice. Mrs. Nicholas J. Constantine
