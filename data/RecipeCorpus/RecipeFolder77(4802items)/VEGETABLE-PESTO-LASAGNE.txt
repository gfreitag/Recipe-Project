This lasagne is especially quick, because you don't need to cook the
lasagne before assembling!

In a medium bowl, stir together the spaghetti sauce and water.

Combine ricotta cheese, egg substitute, 1/4 cup of the mozzarella
cheese and pepper in a bowl. In a food processor or blender, add
basil, Parmesan cheese and garlic; process until smooth. Add Italian
dressing; process until blended. Fold basil mixture (pesto) into
ricotta mixture.

Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Spread 1 cup of the
sauce over the bottom of the pan. Arrange 4 pieces of lasagne (3
lengthwise, 1 widthwise) over the sauce. Cover with 1 1/2 cups of the
sauce. Spread half the ricotta mixture on top. Arrange another 4
pieces of lasagne over ricotta, and top with another cup of the
sauce. Spread remaining ricotta mixture on top. Arrange final 4
pieces of lasagne over ricotta mixture and cover with remaining sauce.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cover lasagne with foil and bake for 1
hour and 5 minutes. Uncover lasagne, sprinkle remaining mozzarella
cheese on top and bake an additional 5 minutes uncovered. Cover and
let stand
15    minutes before serving.
