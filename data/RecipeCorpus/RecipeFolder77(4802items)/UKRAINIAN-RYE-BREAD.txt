Title: UKRAINIAN RYE BREAD
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
Dissolve the yeast in the
Water
1 c  Strong coffee
1 ts Blackstrap molasses
(optional) Add molasses to
The coffee.
3 c  Whole rye flour
1/3 c  Whole buckwheat flour
1 1/4 ts Salt
Mix the dry ingredients.  Add 3/4 cup of the coffee and the yeast
solution. If necessary, use the rest of the coffee if the mixture is
too dry. Use water on your hands to knead the dough for 5-10 minutes.

Cover and let rest for 2 hours at room temperature. It won't really
rise much.  Again, use water on your hands and knead the dough
briefly. Again cover, and let rise for 30 minutes more, covered with
a damp cloth. Shape the dough into 1 or 2 long skinny loaves, again
using water on your hands.

Place the dough on a cookie sheet, either greased or dusted with
flour. Proof the dough in a warm and humid place (85 deg F.) for
about 45 minutes, until the dough is soft. There will be little rise.
Bake at 450 deg. for 20 minutes, with a pan of water in the oven.
Bake at 375 deg. F. for another 30 minutes, without the water.
