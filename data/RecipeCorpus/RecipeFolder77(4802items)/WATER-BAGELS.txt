Title: WATER BAGELS
Categories: None
Yield: 18 Bagels
1 c  Milk, Scalded
1/4 c  Butter
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1    Pkg Active Dry Yeast
2    Eggs
3 3/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 qt Water, Almost Boiling
1 tb Sugar
1    Egg White, Beaten
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine the scalded milk, butter, sugar
and salt. Warm gently to a temperature of between 105 degrees and 115
degrees. Remove from the heat and add and dissolve the yeast in the
mixture. Wait 3 minutes while the yeast works. Blend in the eggs and
flour. Knead this soft dough for 10 minutes, adding flour if needed
to make it firm enough to handle. Place in a greased bowl, cover and
let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down and divide into equal
parts (one part for each finished bagel). Roll each piece into a rope
about 7" long and tapered at the ends. Wet the ends and form a
doughnut-shaped ring from each rope. Cover and let rise on a floured
board for about 15 minutes. Place in a refrigerator for 2 hours to
firm up the dough. Bring the water to a boil and add the sugar. Drop
the rings, one at a time, into the boiling sugar water. When the
bagels surface, turn them over and cook an additional 3 minutes. Skim
the bagels out of the water and place on an ungreased baking sheet.
Coat each with beaten egg white. Bake in the oven until golden brown
(The longer you bake, the crisper the bagel).
