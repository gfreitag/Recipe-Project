Title: TURKEY KABOBS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Swords
2 lb Turkey breast, diced 1" cube
2    Bell Peppers diced 1" cube
1 md Onion, diced 1" cube
1 lg Can pineapple chunks
10 lg Mushrooms
* Make sure the Kabob swords fit your grill. Either they should fit
entirely inside the grill or long enough to place across the lip of
the cooker like a rotisserie. This way the meat and vegetables will
cook evenly. * Make a moderate fire.

Dice all of the turkey breast, onion, and bell peppers. Alternate red
and green peppers to make a nice presentation. Use the pineapple
juice to marinate the mushrooms for about an hour. Thread the meat
and vegetables on the swords as you think will make a good
presentation. Cook over the fire until the meat is done. Baste with
the pineapple juice while cooking. Serve with white rice. Submitted
