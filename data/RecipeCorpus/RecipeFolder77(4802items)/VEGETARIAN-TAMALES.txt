Title: VEGETARIAN TAMALES
Categories: Vegetarian, Tex-mex, Main dish
Yield: 36 Servings
3 oz Dried corn husks
1 c  TVP granules or flakes
7/8 c  Hot water
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Onion, chopped small
3    Cloves garlic, minced
1    Green pepper, chopped small
1 tb Chili powder
2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Garlic salt
1/2 c  Tomato puree
Dash of cayenne
2 c  Masa harina
1 ts Salt
2 tb Margarine or oil
Soak the dried corn husks in cold water for 1 hour.

For the filling, soak the TVP in 7/8 c. hot water for 5 minutes.
Saute the olive oil, onion, garlic and green pepper in a skillet.

Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, tomato puree and cayenne
to the reconstituted TVP. Mix TVP and onions and heat together for 2
minutes. Taste the filling and add a little hot sauce, if desired.

To make the masa dough, place the masa harina and salt into a bowl.
Slowly add enough warm water (about 1 1/2 cups) to make a firm but
moist dough, working in the margarine or oil as you knead the mixture.

To form the tamales, use the palm of your hand to slap-pat the masa
dough into flat patties a quarter-inch thick. Fold patty around a
spoonful of filling and place in a drained corn husk. Fold the husk
over to enclose the filling. If husks are small or broken, use
several pieces. Place 1 cup hot water in thebottom of a kettle, place
a steamer rack in the kettle and stack tamales on rack. Cover pan,
bring water to a boil, reduce heat and steam tamales 45 minutes. You
may want to cook them in two batches, depending on the size of your
steamer.

Makes 36-40 tamales.
