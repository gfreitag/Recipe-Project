Title: TIMMAN (IRAQI-STYLE RICE)
Categories: Main dish, Middle east
Yield: 12 Servings
3 c  Jasmine rice
4 tb Olive oil
Wash rice in cool water and drain. In a large pot, put in rice with
water to cover by 3-4". Bring to boil and cook for 6 minutes. Test by
biting a grain of rice: The outside should be soft but the inside
still hard. Transfer rice to a sieve and rinse. Add oil to the pot
and put wet rice back in. Place a kitchen towel over the pot and
replace the lid. Cook on low heat for 45-55 minutes, or until fluffy.
At the bottom of the pot a crunchy layer will form that is everyone's
part.

Makes 10-12 servings.
