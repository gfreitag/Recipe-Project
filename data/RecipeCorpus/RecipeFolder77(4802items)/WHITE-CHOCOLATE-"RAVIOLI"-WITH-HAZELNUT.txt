1. Preheat oven to 350-F. Form a sheet of tinfoil over the back of a
9 inch square baking pan. Place the foil in the pan and smooth it
into corners and sides as evenly as possible.

2. Place the hazelnuts in a roasting pan. Put them in oven and roast
for 10 minutes, then place nuts in a heavy kitchen towel and rub them
back and forth vigorously, so that their bitter dried skins are
removed. Pick over and discard all skins. Grind the nuts coarsely or
chop in a food processor.

3. Melt the dark chocolate and butter over hot water. Stir in sugar,
brandy, and nuts, and mix well. Form paste into 25 small balls.

4. Arrange the chocolate balls in 5 even rows over the bottom of the
dish, and press each ball down so that it is somewhat flattened
against the bottom of the pan.

5. Place the grated white chocolate over hot water and let it melt
completely. Stir until smooth, then immediately pour the chocolate
into the center of the pan and over as many chocolate rounds as
possible. Using a finger, smooth the chocolate evenly over the balls,
out to the edge of the pan in a thin, flat layer.

6. Place the pan in refrigerator briefly, until the chocolate hardens
somewhat but does not completely firm. Run a knife or ravioli cutter
between the rows and down the sides, then replace dish in the
refrigerator to harden. When firm, lift out the foil and separate the
candies into individual pieces.
