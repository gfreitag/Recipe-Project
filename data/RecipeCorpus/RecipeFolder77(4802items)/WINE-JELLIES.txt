Title: WINE JELLIES
Categories: Jams
Yield: 20 Servings
2 c  Wine
3 c  Sugar
3 oz Liquid pectin (1 pouch)
I (the Frugal Gourmet Cooks With Wine) use a flavorful wine. You can
use port or sherry for a sweeter jelly, but I prefer a Zinfancel,
Gamay Beaujolais, or perhaps a Chardonnay. A Fume Blanc is nice as
well. Stir the sugar into the wine and warm, in a stainless steel
pan, until the sugar is dissolved.  Do not overheat. It must not
quite come to the simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the
pectin, being very careful to dissolve the pectin completely in the
wine and sugar mixture. Pour into small jars. I use 8-ounce jelly
jars. Keep refrigerated. It will keep about 2 months. Makes about 4
cups.
