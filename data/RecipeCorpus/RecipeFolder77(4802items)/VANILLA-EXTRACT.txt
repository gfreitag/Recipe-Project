Title: VANILLA EXTRACT
Categories: Desserts, Beverages, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Vodka
5    Vanilla beans; cut in 1" pcs
Combine vodka and vanilla beans in a jar with a tight-fitting lid.
Cover the jar and let it stand 6 to 8 weeks. (The vodka mixture will
turn amber colored after a day or two.)
After half the vanilla extract is used, add more vodka to cover the
beans.  The flavor in the beans is gone when the vodka no longer
turns to a dark color. Yield: 2 cups.
