Turn the roasting pan around again to cook for the remaining 29
minutes at 70% power.

Carefully remove bird from roasting bag, saving the juices for the
gravy. Remove the stuffing at this point and place in a covered dish
to keep warm. Cover the bird loosely with a tent of tin foil and
leave alone for 1 hour to let the bird finish cooking. Carve and
serve. Refrigerate any leftovers in a plastic sack or a Tupperware
container. The meat will remain moist and juicy for several days.

If your bird is smaller or larger than the example given and you do
not have a meat microwave computer, adjust the times accordingly.
This seems like a lot of work but it really is worth the effort.
