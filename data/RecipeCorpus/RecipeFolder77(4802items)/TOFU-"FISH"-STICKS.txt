Title: TOFU "FISH" STICKS
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 3 Servings
1    Kombu strip, 6 inches long
1/2 c  ;water
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Lime juice
2 tb Tamari
1 ts Tarragon
2 tb Onion; grated
10 oz Tofu, firm
3    Whole grain bread slices
2    Garlic cloves
4    Parsley sprigs
Egg replacer for 2 eggs
Wash the kombu and place it in a small saucepan with 1/2 cup water.
Bring the water to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for
about 10 minutes.

Remove the kombu from the broth and add the lemon juice, lime juice,
tamari, tarragon, and onion to the broth.

Slice the tofu into 6 slabs about 1/4--1/2" thick and about the size
of fish sticks.

Place the tofu in a shallow dish. Pour the broth over the tofu,
trying to distribute the onions evenly. Let this marinate for at
least 30 minutes. If desired, you may let the tofu marinate for
several hours in the refrigerator.

Tear the slices of bread into pieces and place them in a blender or
food processor. Gring the bread into fine crumbs. If you are using a
food processor, you may grind the garlic and the parsley in the food
processor along with the bread. However, if you are using a blender,
you will probably find it necessary to press the garlic and mince the
parsley; then add them to the crumbs and mix well.

Place the seasoned bread crumbs in a plate or shallow bowl. Remove
the tofu from the marinade (the liquid may be reserved to add to
soups, sauces, or to marinate more tofu). Dip the tofu first into the
beaten egg and then into the bread crumbs.

Place the breaded tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until it is brown and crispy.

Serve these tofu sticks with a salad and a steamed vegetable. They
are also good in sandwiches with some horseradish, lettuce, and a
slice of tomato, or with catsup.

These don't really taste like fish sticks, but they do look like
them.
