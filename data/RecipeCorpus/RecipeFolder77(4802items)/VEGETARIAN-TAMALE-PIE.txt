Categories: Casseroles, Vegetarian, Tex-mex
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Onion; chopped
1    Garlic clove; minced
1 tb Oil
2 c  Pinto beans, cooked; mashed
-(or canned refried beans)
1/4 c  Bell pepper, green; chopped
2 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
2 tb Tomato paste
1/2 c  Olive, black, pitted
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Cornmeal, yellow
1 c  ;Water, cold
2 c  ;Water, boiling, with
1/2 ts Salt
4 oz Cheddar; grated
Preheat the oven to 350 F.  SautÂ‚ the onion and garlic in oil.
Combine the beans, tomato paste, and seasonings (omit the seasonings
or adjust to suit your taste if you are using canned, seasoned
refried beans). Add the onion and garlic, and the green pepper and
olives.

For the crust, stir the cornmeal into one cup of cold water, then into
boiling salted water. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick.

Grease an eight-inch square pan.  Spread a little more than half of
the cornmeal in the bottom of the pan. Pour the filling over the
crust and spread evenly. Spoon the remaining cornmeal on top, and
spread a bit (but it won't cover the whole top). Sprinkle the grated
Cheddar on top. Bake for 35 minutes at 350 F. This will be easier to
serve if you let it stand for ten minutes before cutting.
