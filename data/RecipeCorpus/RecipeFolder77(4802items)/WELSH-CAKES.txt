On sale in every Welsh bakery, these are one of the great delights of
teatime.  The are easy to make.  The Welsh use a flat iron "planc" (a
griddle) to bake the cakes, which are cooked on top heat like Scotch
pancakes.  A heavy frying pan will do fine if you don't have a
griddle. Makes 15-18 cakes.

Rub the fat into the flour and add the fruit and sugar. Mix the water
with the eggs and use to make a soft dough just a little firmer than
that for the scones. Tip on to a well-floured board and roll out to a
thickness of 1/2-inch.  Cut out circles with a 2-1/2-inch shell-edged
cutter.

Heat a planc or heavy iron frying pan - get the heat up into it
gently and thoroughly, and do not let it overheat. If the pan is not
well-seasoned or non-stick, slick it with a little butter or
vegetable oil.

Bake the cakes on the pan, turning them once, until well-risen and
lightly browned.  They will take about 5 minutes each side. Eat hot
or cold, with or without salty butter, but always with a cup of
piping-hot tea.
