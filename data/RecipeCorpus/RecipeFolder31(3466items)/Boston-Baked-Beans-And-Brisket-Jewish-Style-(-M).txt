Yield: 6 servings
Dwigans fwds07a
1 lb Navy or kidney beans
3 lb Brisket of beef
1    Sliced onion
1 tb Mustard
1 tb Salt
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Molasses
2 c  Boiling water
Or to cover
Wash, pick over beans, discard any stones, cover with cold water, and
let soak overnight.

Drain the beans, put them in a saucepan, and cover with fresh water.
Heat slowly and cook just below the boiling point until the skins
burst about a 1/2 hour. When done, drain the beans and put them in a
large 6 qt casserole with a lid. Add the brisket of beef and the
onion. Mix the mustard, salt, brown sugar, molasses, and water and
pour over the beans. Cover and bake slowly in a preheated 225 degree
oven for 8 hours, uncovering the casserole the last hour so that the
meat and beans will brown.
