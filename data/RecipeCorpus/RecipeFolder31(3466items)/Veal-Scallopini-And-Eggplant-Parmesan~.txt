Trim any visible fat from scallopini.  Flatten with a mallet any
slices that are thicker so all slices are approximately of the same
thickness.

Combine egg whites, garlic powder, and a sprinkling of pepper in a
bowl; beat well with a wire whisk. Add veal slices, turning to coat
with egg mixture; let stand while preparing eggplant.

Wash, dry and peel the eggplant; cut into 1/4-inch slices.

Drain veal slices and dredge well with breadcrumbs.  In the remaining
egg white mixture, dip eggplant slices then dredge in breadcrumb
mixture. Place veal and eggplant slices on a non-stick baking sheet
and broil 4 inches from heat until browned on both sides. (Or cook
veal and eggplant slices in hot oil until browned on each side.) Turn
oven down to 350~. Spray a 13x9x2" baking dish with cooking spray.

Combine tomato sauce, brown sugar, oregano and 1/8 tsp. pepper in a
saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Spread a little of
the sauce over the bottom of the baking dish. Place eggplant slices
on sauce in baking dish, layering as necessary and spooning sauce
over each layer. Place veal slices on top. Pour remaining sauce over
all and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover and bake in 350~ oven
for 30 to 40 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
