Title: Baked Short Ribs`
Categories: Meats, Cowboy, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
5 lb Beef Short Ribs -- cut into
3    " lengths
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper -- freshly ground
1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 tb Vegetable Oil -- plus more
As needed
2 sm Onions -- sliced
3/4 c  Ketchup
3/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Japanese Soy Sauce
3 tb Worcestershire Sauce
2 tb Cider Vinegar
1/8 ts Ground Hot Red (Cayenne)
Pepper
1. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Season the short ribs with salt and
pepper. Coat the short ribs with the flour, shaking off the excess.

2. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Working in
batches and using additional oil as needed, add the short ribs and
cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 8 mins.
Place the short ribs and onions in a deep casserole.

3. In a medium bowl, stir the ketchup, water, sugar, soy sauce,
Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and ground hot pepper until combined.
Pour over the short ribs.

4. Cover and bake until the short ribs are very tender, about 2 1/2
hrs. Transfer the short ribs to a deep serving platter. Skim any fat
off the surface of the sauce, pour the sauce over the short ribs, and
serve immediately.

NOTE: The short ribs can be prepared outside in a 14-inch Dutch oven.
It is not necessary to brown the floured short ribs if it is not
convenient. Stir occasionally to avoid scorching. You may also use 4
lbs pork spareribs, cut into individual ribs, cooking for 1 1/2 to 2
hours.
