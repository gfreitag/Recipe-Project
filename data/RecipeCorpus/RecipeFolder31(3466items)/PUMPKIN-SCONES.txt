NOTES:

*  Pumpkin scones -- Scones (pronounced with a short `o', rhymes with
`Fonz') are a popular accompaniment to afternoon tea. They are often
served with jam and whipped cream. In this variation the scones are
flavoured with pumpkin. It is not a typical scone recipe.

Pumpkin scones can be eaten in place of bread with a meal.  This
recipe was made famous by the wife of the Premier of Queensland.
Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  To an Australian, a pumpkin is a large round, squat, green or
blue-green vegetable that is orange on the inside.  There are many
varieties, all of species Cucurbita maxima.  In North America a good
substitute is acorn squash (Cucurbita pepo); elsewhere a butternut
squash (Caryoka nuciferum) would be a fair substitute.
