Title: Texas Toast
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------SEE THE FOLLOWING--------------------------
Texas toast is simply a thick slice of white bread that has
:
been buttered and grilled `til lightly browned (not unlike a grilled
cheese sandwich).
Some places prefer to use "tub margarine" that has a lower
:
water content. Some say only butter, and prefer to butter only one
side as opposed to buttering both sides. The choice is entirely up to
you...
Some bread companies sell "Texas Toast" sized sliced bread.
:
If you can find it, it is ideal, but the regular sized will do. The
only difference is the thickness of the slices. (The texas toast
slices are about as thick as 2 slices of regular white bread.)
It is usually served along with pan gravy (gravy made with pan
:
drippings) ala milk or cream gravy, and fried chicken, chicken (or
country) fried steak, or the like... but it is entirely up to your
imagination.
