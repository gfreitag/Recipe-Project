MMMMM-------------------MAKE THE COOKIE DOUGH------------------------
1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375~F. Put
three heavy, large ungreased baking sheets in the refrigerator 2. In
a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, process the
almonds with 1 cup of the flour for 3O to 45 seconds, or until the
mixture is ground to a fine powder. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups plus
2 tablespoons flour; granulated sugar confectioners' sugar and salt.
Process for 10 to 15 seconds, or until the mixture is thoroughly
blended. 3. Evenly distribute the butter cubes in a circle around the
chopping blade. Add the egg, vanilla and lemon zest. Process for 45
to 60 seconds, or until the mixture is creamy. (Make sure that the
butter is completely blended into the batter) 4. Fill a pastry bag
fitted with a closed star tip (such as Ateco #6) with one-fourth of
the cookie dough. (Slightly open the teeth on the end of the pastry
tip so that any small nut particles do not get caught between the
points as you pipe.) 5. Remove a chilled baking sheet from the
refrigerator. Starting at the left-hand side of the midsection of the
baking sheet, pipe 1 1/2-inch long "cats' paws" about 2 inches apart,
across the center of the baking sheet. (This will enable you to pipe
straight and even lines across the baking sheet.) Continue piping
until the bottom half of the baking sheet is covered with piped
cookies. Turn the baking sheet 180 degrees and continue piping cats'
paws onto the other half of the baking sheet. 6. Refrigerate the
baking sheet for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the piped cookie dough is
firm. Pipe the rest of the cookie dough onto the remaining chilled
baking sheets and refrigerate. 7. Bake the cookies one baking sheet
at a time for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn the
baking sheet halfway through baking for even browning. Using a metal
pancake spatula, immediately transfer the cookies to wire racks to
cool. Assemble the cookies: 8. Melt the dark chocolate according to
the melting instructions in the Chocolate Key OR temper the chocolate
following the tempering instructions on page 72. Scrape the chocolate
mixture into a small heatproof bowl. Place the bowl of chocolate over
a smaller bowl of warm (86~F to 90~F) water. 9. Using a small metal
cake spatula, coat the flat side of half of the cookies with a thin
layer of melted or tempered chocolate. Top each chocolate-coated
cookie half with a second cookie. Place the cookies on a waxed
paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes or until
the chocolate is set. 10. Dip the pointed tips of the cookies halfway
into the melted or tempered chocolate. Place the cookies back onto
the waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate 5 to 10 minutes,
or until the chocolate is set. Store the cookies dipped in melted
chocolate in a airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two
weeks. The cookies filled with tempered chocolate may be stored in an
airtight container at room temperature for up to three weeks. Source:
