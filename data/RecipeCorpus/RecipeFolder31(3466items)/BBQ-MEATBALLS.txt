Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats, Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Ground beef
1 lb Bulk pork sausage
1    Sm. onion, finely chopped
1 c  Milk
1    Egg, lightly beaten
2 c  Dry bread crumbs
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Ground allspice (I use a 1/4
-tsp.)
SAUCE:
1 tb Oil
1/4 c  Onion, minced
8 oz Tomato sauce
1 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
MEATBALLS:

MEATBALLS:  Mix all ingredients for "Meatballs".  Form into 1" balls.
Cook in a single layer in a 350 degree oven for about 20-30 minutes
or until browned.  Remove and drain.

Sauce:  Cook onion in oil till tender.  Add remaining ingredients.
Simmer 10 minutes. Place meatballs in a crock pot. Pour sauce over
and keep warm.

Can be made a day or so ahead, refrigerated in the crock, and
reheated. The sauce doesn't make a lot, just enough to coat the balls.
