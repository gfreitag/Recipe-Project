Yield: 4 cups
2 c  Unbleached white flour
2 tb Berbere
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Light oil
Preheat oven to 350F.  In a bowl combine flour, berbere, sugar & salt.
Gradually mix in about 2/3 c of water until a thick paste is formed.
Dump the mixture onto a floured board & knead until you have a stiff
dough. Make a well in the centre of the dough ball & pour in the oil.
Fold the dough over the oil & knead for another 5 minutes.

Cover the dough with a cloth to keep it moist.  Break off chunks to
roll into 1/4" round strips.  Cut these strips into 1/2" long pieces,
preferably using scissors so that the ends wil lbe pinche.  Bake on a
flat sheet for 20 to 30 minutes until crisp.  Stir 2 or 3 times to
ensure even browning. When cool, store in an airtight container.
