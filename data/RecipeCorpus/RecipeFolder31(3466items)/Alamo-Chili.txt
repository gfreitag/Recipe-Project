Title: Alamo Chili
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Stew meat
1 md Onion
1 cn Tomato sauce
2    Cloves garlic
2 tb Of chili powder
2    Jalapeno chili's
2 c  Pinto beans
Salt and pepper to taste
Trim the fat from the stew meat, cut into bite sized chunks and
brown it. Chop the onion and the jalapeno chili.  Smash the garlic.
Throw every thing but the beans into a pot, add water and simmer
until meat is tender.
Put the beans into a pot with water and bring to a boil, turn the
heat down and simmer till the beans are done.
Eat the chili and stomp the hell out of the beans.
Don't confuse this with "Rebel Chile" which also has the beans
stomped out of it.
I brought this recipe back from Mexico and it was said to be the one
that Mexico used when they taught Texans how to make chili at the
Alamo. I understand that to this day Texans do not put beans in
chili. TL: If it hasn't got a bean it must be Texas.
