Title: Stuffed Chicken Mexicano
Categories: Poultry, Cheese/eggs, Salsa/sauce, Hot/spicy, Tex/mexican
Yield: 4 servings
2    Boned chicken breast, whole
1/2 lb Monterey Jack, shredded
1 c  Lightly toasted bread
1/3 c  Salsa, hot
Bread crumbs
1    Egg, beaten
1    Egg, beaten, with 1 TB water
Beat chicken breast flat.  Set aside.

Mix salsa, first egg, cheese and shredded toasted bread.

Roll flattened chicken breasts around the dressing.  Be careful to
seal all openings.  (If you have made Chicken Kiev, you have it made!)

Dip the rolls in the egg mixture and roll in the bread crumbs. Deep
fry until well browned.

I'll think of a sauce to make with this, but I don't have one readily
in mind...
