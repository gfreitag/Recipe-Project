Title: Teriyaki Roast
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Crockpot, Asian
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Soy sauce
1 c  Water
2/3 c  Vinegar
3/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Powdered ginger
Mix all ingredients together. (Double recipe if your roast is extra
large.) Place in deep dutch oven or large casserole dish with lid.
Put roast in after piercing with a large fork several times. Bake for
2 - 3 hours or one hour per pound of meat. After meat is fully
cooked, remove from oven. Put roast on platter and cool for 10
minutes. Slice roast into 1/2" slices and put back into warm
marinade. Let meat absorb marinade for approximately 20 ~ 30 minutes
before serving. While allowing meat to absorb marinade, take 1 to 2
cups of the excess marinade and thicken it in a saucepan using 2 - 3
Tbsp. of cornstarch. If you serve the meat with rice, this makes an
excellent gravy. You may vary the amounts of vinegar and brown sugar
according to your taste. I add them without using a measuring cup,
but the quantities listed are fairly accurate.

Variations:

Marinate uncooked chicken, steaks, or pork chops in marinade for 6
hours at room temperature and then broil in oven or on outside grill.

For chicken, if you don't have 6 hours, you can simmer chicken in
marinade on top of the stove for approximately 45 minutes. If you
have more than 6 - 8 pieces it may take longer.

Shish-Kebabs -- Ask the butcher to slice a boneless roast into 1/2"
slices. Slice it into 1 1/2" strips when you get home. Marinate it
for 5 - 6 hours. Swivel meat onto skewers alternating with green
pepper wedges, and tomato wedges. Fresh pineapple and mushrooms may
also be used. Grill on outside grill or in oven.
