and vanilla until smooth and fluffy. Using a wooden spoon, stir in
one third flour mixture at a time, beating until smooth and well
combined. Fill cookie press with dough.  Then make the following
shapes.  If dough is warm, refrigerate it, but keep it pliable.  It
will be crumbly if too cold. Preheat oven to 375~. Make wreaths: use
star disk.  Force dough onto cold cookie sheet in a 12-inch strip,
cut strip into three parts. Form each part into a circle. Continue
forming wreaths. Decorate with cinnamon candies and angelica or
candied cherries. For Christmas trees, rosettes or stars: use
appropriate disk. For each, stand press upright on cold cookie sheet.
Force out dough to form shape. Release pressure; lift up slightly to
cut off dough. Cookies hsould ge 1-1/2 inches apart.  Sprinkle with
nonpareils, colored sugar and silver dragees. Sugar bars: use a
striped-bar disk. Force dough onto cold cookie sheet in a 12-inch
strip; cut strip into four 3-inch bars; place 1 inch apart.  Continue
forming bars.  Sprinkle with colored sugar. Bake cookies 8-10 minutes
or until light golden.  Remove to wire rack; cool. Makes about 4
