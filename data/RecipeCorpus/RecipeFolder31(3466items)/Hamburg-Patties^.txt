Title: Hamburg Patties^
Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Ground round steak
Salt and pepper
1 tb To 2 onion, grated
Butter
1 c  Water
Mix meat and seasonings. Shape into thick cakes with a slight
depression in the center. Heat frying pan hissing hot but with no fat
in it. Sear meat quickly on both sides, reduce heat and cook until
desired doneness, 8-10 minutes. Remove meat to platter, add water to
skillet and stir well; pour over meat and dot with butter. Serve
right away or the meat cakes will get tough. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
