Title: ARTICHOKE OYSTER SOUP
Categories: Soup/stew, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
6 tb Butter, melted
1/2 c  Shallots (chopped fine)
1/4 ts Thyme
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
2 tb Flour
14 oz Chicken broth
-(more or less won't hurt)
4 c  Oysters, drained; reserve
-liquid (less, to taste)
14 oz Artichoke hearts, cooked
2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Tabasco
1/2 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Parsley (chopped, fresh)
In a 3-quart casserole, melt butter and saute shallots.  When
shallots are translucent, add thyme, bay leaf and cayenne pepper.
Add flour and whisk well.  Add broth, oyster water, artichoke hearts,
salt and tabasco.  Bring to a boil. Add oysters and parsley. Simmer
on medium, partly covered, for exactly 5 minutes.  Add whipped cream
and serve immediately.

NOTES:

*  Chicken broth with artichokes and poached oysters -- This is a
modern cajun-style recipe that I adapted from a local
convenience-food cookbook by Jean Durkee.  It's an intriguing
combination of modern American ingredients with traditional cajun
flavorings.

*  Fresh parsley tastes much better than dried parsley.  If the
oysters are bigger than a small bite-size, cut them up before adding
them to the soup. Use the smallest oysters you can find.

*  When I'm not making a double recipe, I usually dump the entire
(about 1-cup) container of whipping cream into the soup, even though
that's double what the recipe calls form.

*  The timing on cooking the oysters is fairly critical.  If you
overcook them, they will be rubbery.

: Difficulty:  easy.
