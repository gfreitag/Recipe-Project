Title: Savory Broccoli Salad
Categories: Fruit, Main dish, Nuts/grains, Salads
Yield: 4 servings
Salt
1 md Head broccoli
-- (abt. 3 cups florets)
1/4 c  Mayonnaise
1 tb Vinegar*
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Salted, toasted sunflower
-seeds
1    Thin slice red onion
*Any kind; cider vinegar is good.

Fill a 3-quart saucepan with about 3" of water.  Salt the water and
bring it to a boil.

Meanwhile, cut the broccoli head into florets.  If desired, peel the
stem and cut it into small chunks.  (A salad made only of florets is
prettier, but you might not want to throw out the broccoli stems.
Once peeled of tough outer skin, they make good eating.)

When the water boils, add broccoli.  Cover the pan for 1 minute, then
remove the cover and cook broccoli 4 to 5 minutes more.  Timing
depends on how big the florets are, but the broccoli should be tender
and bright green.  Drain well.

As broccoli cooks, put mayonnaise and vinegar in a large bowl; stir.
Add drained broccoli and raisins.  Add half the sunflower seeds and
toss briefly.  Mince the red onion.  Sprinkle red onion and remaining
sunflower seeds over broccoli before serving.

Serve with picnic fare, or at dinner with grilled (or broiled)
chicken and corn on the cob.
