Title: Broccoli With Sliced Almonds~
Categories: Low cal/fat
Yield: 6 servings
2    To 3 lbs Broccoli
Ice water
1/3 c  Sliced almonds
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
2 tb Salt
Freshly grated nutmeg
Cut off the broccoli florets from the stems. Peel the stems; cut into
1/2 to 1-inch long pieces. Place in a bowl with the florets and add
ice water to cover. Set aside for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 300~. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast
just until beginning to show color, 5 to 6 minutes. Let cool.

Melt butter in a small saucepan; set aside.

Fill a large pot three-fourths full of water, bring to a rapid boil
and add the salt. Drain broccoli well and plunge it into the boiling
water. Bring back to a boil and cook, uncovered, until just tender
yet still bright green and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain well.

Transfer broccoli to a serving dish. Add the toasted almonds and a
little nutmeg to the melted butter. Spoon over broccoli and serve.
Serves 6-8.

My Note:  I'm not sure how much salt is absorbed into the broccoli
during cooking. If you omit the 2 tablespoons salt the sodium count
is only 10 mg.
