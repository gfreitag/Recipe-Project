Title: Basic Cream Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Desserts
Yield: 1 pie
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 c  AM Pastry Flour
4 tb Unrefined vegetable oil
3 tb Cold water
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 c  Milk
-OR- soymilk
-- (plain or flavored)
1/2 c  Honey or other syrup
3    Egg yolks
1 tb Vanilla
1/4 c  Arrowroot powder
-OR- corn starch
1 tb Cold water
3    Egg whites
-- beaten until peaks form
-- (beat while pudding
-- is cooling)
CRUST: Mix all ingredients.  Roll out between wax paper, place in 9"
pie pan, poke bottom of crust a few times with a fork, and bake at
350 F. for 10-15 minutes.

FILLING: Combine all ingredients except egg whites in a deep
saucepan. Beat until thoroughly blended and all powder is dissolved.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture begins to
thicken.  Lower heat and continue stirring and cooking until mixture
is very thick.  A wire whisk works well and helps keep lumps from
forming.  Set pudding off heat and let partially cool while preparing
the egg whites.  Pour pudding into cooled crust.  Top with stiffly
beaten egg whites.  Bake at 350 F. until whites begin to brown, about
15 minutes.  Cool.

Peanut Butter Cream Pie (add to above recipe):  Stir 1/2 to 3/4 cup AM
Peanut Butter into liquids before cooking.
