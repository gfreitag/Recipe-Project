1 1/2 lb Beef -- lean ground
1/2 lb Pork -- ground
2    Eggs -- lightly beaten
1 c  Bread crumbs -- very fine
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the
onions, celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco,
Worcestershire and seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking
excessively, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the
pan bottom well.

Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to
room temperature.

Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.
Add the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs,
remove the bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the
center of the pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2
inches high, 6 inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350o
F for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400o F and continue cooking
until done, about 35 minutes longer.

Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef. This
is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives
more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.
