Title: BYRON'S FAMOUS KILLER CHEESE DIP
Categories: Dips/spread, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
11 oz Cheese soup (one can
-of condensed soup)
4 oz Green chilies, chopped
-(I use Old El Paso
-canned chilies)
1 md Yellow onion, chopped
1 tb Red pepper, crushed
2 tb Chili powder
1 tb Cumin
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1/4 ts Hot sauce (Tabasco sauce
-or hot pepper sauce)
8 oz Sour cream
Mix together all ingredients except the sour cream; heat to boiling
at low heat.  When blended, correct seasoning (usually needs more
cumin and garlic.) Add sour cream and heat until it bubbles slightly.
Serve with Tostitos or any natural Mexican-style corn chip.

NOTES:

*  A hot spicy party cheese dip -- Here it is, folks!  By popular
demand, the cheese dip known to make women faint, strong men cry, and
small children run for their mommies. This started out as an attempt
to replicate a Chili con Queso dip, but took off in its own
direction. Yield: makes 18 oz of dip.

*  This recipe may be doubled, quadruped or even sextupled without
problem. Go easy on the red pepper if your guests don't like hot
food.  The effect, if done correctly, should be an initial impression
of cheese, cumin, sour cream and garlic followed a second later by a
sinus-cleaning heat. As one partaker has put it "You have to keep
eating because if you don't, you'll die." Guaranteed to increase beer
consumption at parties.

Good Luck!

: Difficulty:  very easy.
: Time:  10 minutes.
: Precision:  Measure the spices, just so you'll know how much you
have put in.
