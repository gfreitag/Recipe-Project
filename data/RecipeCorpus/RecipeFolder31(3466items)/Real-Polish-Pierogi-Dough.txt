Title: Real Polish Pierogi Dough
Categories: Appetizers, Polish, Pie/tart
Yield: 18 servings
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Water
2    Eggs
Mound flour on a bread board and make a well in the center. Drop eggs
and salt into well. Add water; working from the center to the outside
of flour mound, mix flour into liquid in center with one hand and
keep flour mounded with other hand. Knead until dough is firm and
well mixed. Cover dough with a warm bowl; let rest 10 minutes. Divide
dough into halves. On floured surface, using half of dough at a time,
roll dough as thin as possible. Cut out 3 inch rounds with large
biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of filling a little to one
side on each round of dough. Moisten edge with water, fold over and
press edges together firmly. Be sure they are well sealed to prevent
filling from leaking out. Drop pierogi into boiling salted water.
Cook gently 3 to 5 minutes, or until pierogi float. Lift out of water
with perforated spoon. Yeild: 1 to 2 dozen.
