Now the starters.  This is
The starter that Connie used
After that is
An alternative for people
Who have trouble with the
First one.
Potato starter I: 1 cup water, 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup potato flakes.

Mix the ingredients.  Cover loosely and leave in a warm place, such
as on top of a water heater, for 3 or 4 days.  If the mixture starts
to smell yeasty prior to 3 or 4 days, or is ready.  Go ahead and feed
it and start making bread.  See the feeding directions below.  This
is from the "Panola COunty Heritage Cookbook".

For people who have trouble cultivating wild yeast, this is an
alternate starter recipe.

Potato starter II: 2 evelopes (2 TBSP) active dry yeast, 1/2 cup warm
water (105 to 115 F), 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 F), 2/3 cup sugar,
and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a medium mixing bowl.
Stir in 1 cup warm water, sugar, and potato flakes.

Let the mixture sit out all day, then refrigerate 10 to 15 days.  (A
10-day schedule works fine.)  Remove from refrigerator and feed, see
the

feeding instructions below.  Now you are ready to use 1 cup of the
starter to make bread.

Return the rest of the starter to the refrigerator for another 5 to 10
days.  Before making your next batch of bread, feed the starter again.
