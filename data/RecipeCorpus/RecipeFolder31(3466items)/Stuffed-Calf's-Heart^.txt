Title: Stuffed Calf's Heart^
Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1    Calf's heart
3/4 c  Bread crumbs
2 tb Butter, melted
2 tb Celery, chopped
2 tb Onion, chopped
Salt and pepper
4 sl Bacon
1/2 c  Water or pineapple juice
Wash heart under running water. Cut out cords and veins and wipe dry.
Mix bread crumbs, butter, celery, onion and seasonings. Fill heart
cavity. Sew the opening shut. Dredge with flour and place in baking
pan; put bacon on top of heart. Pour water or juice into pan and bake
in moderately hot oven, basting frequently. If you use a beef heart,
double the stuffing recipe and leave out the pineapple juice. Cook at
a lower temperature and for a longer time Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
