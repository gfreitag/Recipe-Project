Let the chicken come to room temperature before preparing the salad.
Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until all the fat
has been rendered.  Drain the bacon on paper towels, leaving the fat
in the skillet. While the bacon is cooking prepare the chicken for
the salad. Leave the burnt skin on unless it's bitter tasting.
Remove the bones. Cut the chicken into thin slices and place in a
mixing bowl.  Add the peppers and mushrooms, crumble in the bacon,
and toss.  Tear the romaine into bite size pieces.  Toss with the
scallions in the bottom of a large salad bowl. Add the garlic and
onion to the the hot bacon fat in the skillet and cook over medium
heat until softened, about 10 seconds.  Add the vinegar,
worcestershire, hot pepper sauce and sugar.  Bring to a boil, season
with salt and pepper, and whisk to blend.  Pour 3/4 of the hot
dressing over the chicken mixture and toss to coat.  Pour the
remainder over the greens and toss.  Make a well in the center of the
greens and put the chicken salad in the well.  Serve immediately.
