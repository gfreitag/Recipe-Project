Title: RUM/BOURBON BALLS
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 2 dozen
3 c  Vanilla Wafers
-(crushed)
1 c  Sugar, powered
1 1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
1 1/2 ts Cocoa powder
2 tb Corn syrup, white
-(honey also works well)
1/2 c  Rum or Bourbon
Mix all dry ingredients and set aside.

Mix corn syrup or honey with rum or bourbon to thin the syrup.  Blend
wet mixture into dry ingredients with fork.  Mix well.  Allow to sit
for 1-2 hours.

At this point, if you let it sit a couple of hours, you can come
back and add another about 1/2 cup of rum or bourbon and let sit
again. This process may be repeated a few times to your taste. The
last time, the mix should sit a couple of hours so it's not really
moist. There's a good midpoint between too moist and too dry where
rolling into balls won't be difficult (too wet) or cause crumbling
(too dry).

Roll into balls, then roll in powered sugar to make a sugar coating.
When rolling in powered sugar, the moister they are, the more sugar
will be absorbed over time.  They may need another roll in the sugar
right before serving.

NOTES:

*  Intoxicating chocolate snack with rum or bourbon -- I got this
from my mom who uses more alcohol than the original recipe called for
but less than I like to use. It makes a great party snack. Yield:
Makes about 30 small balls.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
