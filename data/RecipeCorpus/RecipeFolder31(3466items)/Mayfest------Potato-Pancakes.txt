Title: Mayfest  --  Potato Pancakes
Categories: Aust/german, Snacks, Breakfast, Potatoes
Yield: 1 servings
2 lb Potatoes
4 tb Flour
1    Egg, beaten
2 tb Sour cream
2 tb Dried diced onions  (opt)
Salt to taste
Peel the potatoes; wash and dry.  Grate the potatoes very thin (do it
quickly or the potatoes will turn dark).  Mix in the remaining
ingredients.

Heat oil in a frying pan; when hot, add a heaping Tbsp of the potato
mixture.  Flatten the patty with the back of a spoon (the thinner the
crisper the pancake); fry on both sides until golden brown.

Serve with applesauce.

NOTE:  Frozen shredded hash browns may be substituted for the
potatoes. One egg may be substituted for the sour cream.
