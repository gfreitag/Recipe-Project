Categories: Condiments, Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
3    Egg yolks
pn Slat
ds Paprika
1 pt Oil, or more
1    Lemon, juice of
Slowly stir eggs, salt and paprika in a cold bowl with a silver fork
until yolks are mixed. Add oil, drop by drop, stirring always, and in
the same direction. While it looks oily,add a drop of lemon juice.
Continue this oil/lemon process until it is used up. Three egg yolks
will take at least a pint of oil and maybe more. If you do not want
as much dressing as this, just use fewer eggs.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
