Title: Dutch Oven Biscuits`
Categories: Breads
Yield: 16 servings
1/4 c  Vegetable Shortening
1/2 c  Warm Water
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/2 c  Nonfat Dry Milk
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Baking Powder Plus 1 Tsp
1/2 ts Salt
1. Build a charcoal fire with 36 briquets, and let them burn until
they are covered with ash. Place 12 of the coals in a circle.

2. Place a 12-in Dutch oven over the circle of coals. Add the
shortening to the Dutch oven and heat until melted. Using pot
holders, tilt the Dutch oven to lightly coat the interior with melted
shortening. In a heatproof bowl, pour the shortening into the warm
water; mix well.

3. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, dry milk, sugar, baking
powder, and salt and mix well with a fork to aerate. Stir the liquid
into the dry ingredients, just to make a soft dough. Do not overmix.

4. Drop heaping Tbs of the dough into the Dutch oven. Place the lid
on top and use a spade to place the remaining coals on the lid.

5. Cook the biscuits until they are lightly browned, 15 to 20 mins.
Serve hot. Makes about 16 biscuits from Stephen Zimmer of Philmont
