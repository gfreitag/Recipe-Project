Title: Salmon Chops^
Categories: Fish, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 cn Salmon
2 ts Butter
2 ts Flour
1/2 ts Salt
ds Cayenne
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Parsley, chopped
Macaroni
1    Egg
Bread crumbs
Remove skin and bones from salmon and mash fish with a silver fork.
Mix together butter, flour, salt and cayenne; add the fish, lemon and
parsley. Chill and form into "chops". Dip in beaten egg and bread
crumbs, put a piece of macaroni in one end for a "bone" and fry in
hot lard until brown on both sides. This is very good, but they'll
know it's not pork chops. Many of the recipes in this collection did
not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as
they appear in the book, typos and all.
