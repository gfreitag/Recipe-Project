The accent here is on a wet spicy flavour of the East, so don't be
afraid to use a robustly flavoured tropical fish.  The red snapper we
used has a firm white flesh.

1. Cut the fish into large strips and place in a shallow bowl. Crush
the coriander, fennel and cumin seeds with sugar in a pestle and
mortar. Add the chilli sauce, garlic, oil and salt.  Combine and
spread marinade over the fish.  Leave for 20 minutes, longer if you
wish. Place creamed coconut in a screw-top jar, add three tablespoons
of boiling water and dissolve. Add the oil, lime zest and juice,
chopped chilli, sugar and coriander. Shake.

2. Wash and dry the lettuces. Dress and combine with the fruit and
spring onions. Divide between four large plates. Heat a non-stick pan
over a moderate heat, add the fish and cook for five minutes turning
once.  Place fish on salad.  Serve warm.
