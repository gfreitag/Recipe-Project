Categories: Cheese/eggs, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM--------------------HERBED BISCUIT CRUST-------------------------
2 c  Flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
1 ts Dried crushed rosemary
1 tb Garlic powder
1 ts Lemon pepper
6    To 7 tablespoons shortening
2/3    -3/4 cup milk
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
7    Eggs
1    Onion, chopped
2 c  Lightly steamed broccoli
Flowerets
1 c  Grated cheddar cheese
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Dried tarragon
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Lemon pepper
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
1. To make biscuit crust: Into bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and
salt. Add the garlic powder, lemon pepper, thyme, and rosemary.  With
pastry blender or 2 knives, used scissor-fashion, cut in shortening
until mixture is like coarse corn meal.  Make well in center; pour in
1/2 cup milk. With fork, mix lightly and quickly.  Add enough more
milk to form dough, just moist enough to leave sides of bowl and
cling to fork as ball.  Knead a few times, working gently, until a
dough is formed.

2. Press the biscuit dough into an 8" x 8" inch pan, lining bottom and
sides.  Depending upon how thick you want the crust, there may be a
little left over -- it can be used for biscuits baked on the side or
as a crust for a smaller individual dish.

3. Lightly cook the chopped onions -- either steam, saute, or cook in
the microwave for a few minutes.  Spread the onion over the dough in
the pan.

4. In a bowl, mix the eggs, tarragon, thyme, garlic powder, lemon
pepper, and salt if desired.  Pour into crust.

5. Add the broccoli flowerets to the egg mixture in the crust.
Sprinkle the cup of grated cheddar cheese over the top.  Bake in a
400 degree oven for 35-40 minutes.

Note: You can vary the ingredients by using different vegetables,
cheeses, or meats in the filling.  You can also substitute your
favourite herbs in the crust.
