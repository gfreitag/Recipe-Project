Brown bacon in a heavy saucepan, drain and set aside. Fry onion in
bacon fat over low heat. Stir and cook until onion is transparent.
Add tomatoes, beef and bacon. Simmer 5 minutes. Stir in cheese. Pour
into tureen and serve over fresh bread. If the family is getting
anxious for supper to be ready, set the table. It will encourage
them. Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts

book, typos and all.
