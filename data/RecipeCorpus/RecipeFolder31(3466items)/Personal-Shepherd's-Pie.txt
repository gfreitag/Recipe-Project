Baked potatoes with toppings are hot in England. Here's a fun
make-ahead appetizer for those with air conditioning.

WASH and dry potatoes. Pierce but don't peel. Rub all over with oil.
Place in a single layer in a shallow baking pan. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Bake in 400F oven 40 to 45 minutes or until tender,
turning once.

MEANWHILE, in medium skillet, saute beef with onion over medium-high
heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking up well with a wooden
spoon. Stir in Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, thyme and salt and
pepper to taste. Lower heat and simmer 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Cool. Taste and adjust seasoning.

WHEN potatoes are cool enough, to handle, cut in two and carefully
scoop out the pulp with a melon-baller or spoon, leaving a 1/4 inch
border. Set shells on baking sheet and place pulp in a small bowl
Mash pulp with fork. Beat in cream cheese, Parmesan, parsley and salt
and pepper to taste. Fill potato shells with beef mixture and
carefully spread potato mixture over top. (Prepare recipe to this
point and refrigerate up to 8 hours, loosely covered. Bring to room
temperature before proceeding).

TO serve, heat in 400F oven 15 minutes, then raise rack close to
element and broil 2 to 3 minutes or until goldenbrown on top.

MAKES 24 appetizers.
