Title: Mississippi Mud Pie 3
Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 lb Butter
3 oz (Squares) unsweetened choc.
3    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Light corn syrup
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
Vanilla ice cream (opt)
You'll also need pastry for a 9" pie. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line
a 9" pie plate with the pastry. Combine the butter and chocolate in a
saucepan. Heat gently, stirring often, until melted and blended. Beat
the eggs until light and frothy. Stir in the corn syrup, sugar and
vanilla. Pour in the chocolate mixture, stirring. Pour the filling
into the prepared pie plate. Bake 35-40 minutes until the top is
slightly crunchy and the filling is set. Do not overcook. The filling
should remain soft inside. This is best served warm with a spoonful
of vanilla ice cream on top, but it is excellent served at room
temperature or cold.
