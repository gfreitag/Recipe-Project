BUILDING BLOCKS:

Today's sandwich wrappers have moved beyond your basic two slices of
bread. If you can stuff, pile or layer a filling with it... then try
it! Some ideas: bagels, onion nuns, taco shells, foccacia,
croissants, tortillas, pitas, matzo, flat breads, banana bread, rye,
sourdough, seven grain, fresh bread sticks, baguettes, etc.

THE MEDITERRANEAN HERO:

Otherwise known as pan bagna (which means bathed bread), this sandwich
starts with a crusty loaf split in half, lengthwise. Scoop out the
insides of each half and drizzle with olive oil. Fill one side with
flaked tuna, capers, hard boiled eggs, anchovies, sliced red onions,
olives, salad greens and tomato slices. Sandwich it with top layer of
bread. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes to "bathe" the bread.

ROLL UPS:

~ Take Indian chapati, paratha or pita and roll it up with warm rice,
grated vegetables and nuts. Dip in yogurt or chutney. - Take a Mexican
tortilla, roll it up with refried beans, grated cheese and chopped
onions. Heat under broiler. Serve with salsa. - Take a Vietnamese
spring roll wrapper, roll it up with cold rice vermicelli, mung bean
sprouts and shredded cold chicken. Dip in peanut sauce.

MEATBALL SANDWICHES:

Use a firm crusty bread for this potentially messy creation. Go
beyond your basic beef meatballs and consider turkey, chicken,
salmon, tofu or nut veggie balls. Top meatballs with roasted sweet
peppers, grilled eggplant, sliced pickles, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.

BEYOND GRILLED CHEESE:

Try these new combinations cooked open-faced under the broiler, in a
sandwich grill or frying pan; Monterey Jack, olive paste and roasted
peppers; Cheddar, Dijon mustard, back bacon and tomatoes; Mozzarella,
avacado and salsa (garnished with alfalfa sprouts), sharp Cheddar and
mango chutney; Gorgonzola and walnuts.

GO CUBAN!:

A Florida favorite, Cuban sandwiches are made with soft, chewy,
bullet-shaped rolls. Fill with ham, roast pork, cheese, mustard and
pickles. Flatten it in a sandwich grill to create a dense, delicious
treat.

NUTRITION - TIP OF THE WEEK:

Hold the mayo or cut it with low-fat yogurt to reduce calories in your
favorite sandwich.
