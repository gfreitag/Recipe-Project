Ham: Trim fat off ham. chop fat, mix with other ingredients. Wipe ham
with a damp cloth. Put into a baking dish and cover with the crumb
mixture. Bake 1 hour at 375F and baste 3 to 4 times. While ham is in
oven, make curried fruit.

Curried Fruit: Drain fruits and put as much as will fit into a deep
baking dish. Mix butter with sugar and curry powder and pour over
fruit. Bake in the same oven (she had more than one?????) as ham for
40 minutes. Serve from baking dish with ham. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
