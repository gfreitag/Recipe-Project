Celery is sold all the year round, so you can easily make this soup
at any time. Serve with crispy sesame sticks - they contrast
perfectly in flavour and texture.

Preparation Time: 25 minutes plus cooling Cooking Time: 45 minutes

Preparation:

Wash and thinly chop the celery Remove the crusts from the white bread
Soften the butter Chop the fresh parsley

1. Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Melt the butter and oil in a
large saucepan. Add the celery and leaves, onion and sesame seeds.
Cook over a gentle heat for 10 minutes until softened. Add the flour
and cook for 2 minutes. Take off the heat and gradually stir in the
milk and stock until well blended. Bring to the boil and simmer for
30 minutes. Season to taste.

2. Remove from the heat and allow the soup to cool. Blend until
smooth in a liquidiser, then return to the pan and heat through
gently.

3. Meanwhile make the sesame sticks; roll out the slices of bread
firmly with a rolling pin. Blend the butter, parsley and sesame seeds
together. Spread three-quarters of the butter mixture over the slices
of bread.

4. Roll up the bread and secure two sticks at a time with cocktail
sticks. Spread the remaining butter on top of the bread sticks. Place
on a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes, until they are crisp and
golden. Remove the cocktail sticks.

5. Serve the soup hot, garnished with celery leaves and accompanied by
sesame sticks.

Freezing: The soup and sticks can be made in advance and frozen for
up to 6 months. Do not cook the sticks befre freezing.
