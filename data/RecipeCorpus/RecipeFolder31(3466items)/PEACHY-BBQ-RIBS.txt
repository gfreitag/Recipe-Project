NOTES:

*  Pork ribs in peach tomato barbecue sauce -- Moons ago my Mom made
this for all us kids. Wouldn't eat it (ribs & peaches? YUCHH!). Years
(literally) passed. Well, if you hadn't guessed, when I tried it, I
decided to post it to the net (as soon as I grew up). Yield: Serves 4
to 6.

: Difficulty:  easy.
