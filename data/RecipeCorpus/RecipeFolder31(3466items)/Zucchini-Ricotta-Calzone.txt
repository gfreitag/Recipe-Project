Title: Zucchini Ricotta Calzone
Categories: Italian
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Butter
2 c  Zucchini, packed, grated
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1 c  Ricotta cheese
1 c  Cheddar cheese, extra-old
-shredded
1 ea Egg
1/2 ts Oregano, dried
1/2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 lb Pizza dough (500g), prepared
IN skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and
garlic. Cook, stirring often, 7 to 10 minutes or until most of the
liquid has evaporated. In a bowl, blend together zucchini mixture,
ricotta, Cheddar, egg, oregano, basil, salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Refrigerate while rolling out the dough.

DIVIDE dough into 4 portions and shape into balls. On lightly floured
surface, roll or stretch each ball into an 8-inch circle. Divide
filling among dough rounds; fold dough over to make half-circles,
leaving enough dough on the bottom edge to fold over top edge. Crimp
edges to seal (it may be easier to fill and form soft calzone right
on the baking sheet).

BAKE on greased baking sheet in 425F oven for about 20 minutes or
until golden brown.

* Calzones are baked pizza-dough turnovers. Buy ready-to-bake pizza
dough in plastic bags in the refrigerator or freezer sections of
many
supermarkets. The weight may vary -- if you have more than you need,
cut off the extra and freeze to make pizza later. Serve calzones
warm
or at room temperature with a tossed salad. Submitted By SAM
