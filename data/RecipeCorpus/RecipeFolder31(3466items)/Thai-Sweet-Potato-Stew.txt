Van Dyne writes: "Curry, coconut milk and peanuts are popular Thai
ingredients; this recipe blends all three to give the dish a little
sweetness, spice and crunch.  If reduced-fat coconut milk is not
available, you can substitute regular coconut milk, but know that the
fat content will be increased substantially."
