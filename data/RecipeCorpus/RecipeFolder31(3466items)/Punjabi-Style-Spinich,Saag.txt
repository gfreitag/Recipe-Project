Categories: Vegetables, Fatfree, Indian
Yield: 1 servings
1    Yellow onion, chopped
1    Clove of garlic, finely
Chopped
1    Hot pepper (he uses whole
Dried red pepper and crushes
It)
1 ds Oil, Pam or saute liquid
1 ts Huldi or tumeric
1 ea Salt to taste
1    Bag of Fresh spinich
1    Potato, peeled and cubed
First WASH the spinich very well.  Break off ugly parts of leaves and
stems. Peel and cube the potato. Place both in a large saucepan and
add very little water, about 1/4 cup. Let cook on Med temp. until the
potatoes are cooked, adding water when needed and then only a little
at a time.

When the potatoes are done, heat another deepsided frying pan.  Add
oil, Pam or saute liquid. When the saute medium is hot add the garlic
and onion. Fry until the onion is translucent. Add salt, hot pepper
and huldi. Fry some more.  The huldi should turn everything yellow.

Incidently, huldi is very good for your stomach, reduces gas when
used in dal recipies.

Fry everything together for about a minute, don't let the onions turn
brown, turn down the heat if needed.

Add the spinich to the onion mixture, stirring constantly but not
hard.

Serve with cornmeal roti.
