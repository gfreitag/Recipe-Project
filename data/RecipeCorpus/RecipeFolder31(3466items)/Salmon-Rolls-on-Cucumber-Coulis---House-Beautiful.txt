from heat and reserve.

salmon at the end of a piece of smoked salmon, roll it up and set
aside. Make 8 rolls. If making this ahead, cover and refrigerate.

Place cucumber quarters in a food processor and process until pureed.

Divide sauce evenly among 4 dinner plates, place 2 pieces of salmon
on top of sauce, garnish with herbs and serve. Serves 4.
