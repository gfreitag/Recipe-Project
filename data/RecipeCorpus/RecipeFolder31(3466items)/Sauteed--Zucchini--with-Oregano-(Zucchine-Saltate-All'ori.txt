Title: Sauteed  Zucchini  with Oregano (Zucchine Saltate All'ori
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 to 6)
MMMMM--------------------SOURCE: VOGE JAN'94-------------------------
680 ea Zucchinis, preferably small
-young  ones,  very  firm
-and   fresh
8 tb Olive oil
3 ea Cloves garlic,  peeled  and
- chopped medium fine
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
1/4 ts Fresh oregano leaves
Soak the zucchini for 10  minutes  in  a basin of cold  water.  Then
scrub them under  cold  running  water  until   the skin feels  clean
and smooth. If  the skin is flabby or blemished,  and  still feels  a
bit gritty, scrape  away  or lightly peel the thin top layer.  Cut
off and discard both ends from all the zucchinis.  Slice  the  zuc-
chinis into very thin discs and  set aside.  Choose   a    frying pan
deep enough to contain all the sliced  zucchini  without piling them
up more than 2.Scm to 3.5cm high. Put in  the oil and garlic, and
turn the heat on to medium. When the garlic has colored lightly, add
the zucchini, 2 or 3 large pinches of salt, some pepper, and the
oregano, Turn the heat up to medium high, and cook, uncovered,
stirring frequently. If the zucchini are as fresh as they ought to
be, they will be done in less than 10 minutes. They should be tender
but still a little firm.  Drain away most of the oil before serving,
leaving just   enough to coat the zucchini, and for a crusty piece of
good bread to mop up. Note: this dish can be prepared entirely in
advance, several hours before serving. Do not refrigerate. Reheat
gently just before serving. (Copyright: The Second Classic Italian
