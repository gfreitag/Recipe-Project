Preheat oven to 350F.  Spread eggplant cubes onto a lightly oiled
baking sheet & roast in the oven for 15 minutes.  The pieces should
be tender enough for a fork to slide in easily.  Remove from oven.

Meanwhile, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, spices, herbs & lemon
juice in a bowl.  Add still warm eggplant & mix well.  Cover & let
sit for 2 hours or put in the refrigerator where it will keep for
several days.

Add remaining vegetables within an hour or two of serving.  Serve
garnished with olives.
