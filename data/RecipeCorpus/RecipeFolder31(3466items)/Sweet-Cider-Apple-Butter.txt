Title: Sweet Cider Apple Butter
Categories: Fruit, Dips/spread, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
24 md Apples -- about 6 lbs
2 c  Sweet cider
3 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
To prepare pulp:  Wash apples; remove stems and blossom ends; do not
peel or core. Cut apples into small pieces. Cook apples in cider
until tender. Press through a sieve or food mill. Measure 3 quarts
apple pulp.

To prepare butter;  Combine apple pulp, sugar and spices in a large
saucepot. Cook slowly until thick enough to round up on a spoon. As
pulp thickens, stir frequently to prevent sticking. Ladle hot butter
into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Adjust two-piece caps.
Process 10 minutes in a boiling-water canner. Yield: about 3 pints.
