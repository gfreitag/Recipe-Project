NONSTICK SPRAY
1    Box angel food cake mix;
-(enough for 2 single layers
2 pk (4-oz) SUGAR-FREE gelatin;

2 c  Boiling water;
2 c  Diet whipped topping; thawed

Spray bottom and sides of 2 8" round cake pan with NONSTICK spray.
Then cake layers can be easily removed after they bake and cool.  Mix
and bake two cake layers according to package directions.  Let cakes
cool completely.  Remove each cake layer from its pan and set aside.
(If cake does not come out easily, dip the bottom of the pan in warm
water for about 10 seconds.)  Wash pan and dry them well.  Then
return each cake layer to its pan.   Dissolve EACH package of gelatin
of in separate cup of water. Stir each cup so gelatin is thoroughly
dissolved. Pierce EACH cake layer with a large fork or a small straw.
Make the small holes at about 1/2" intervals over each layer. Pour
dissolved gelatin over the cake, 1 cup for EACH LAYER, allowing
gelatin to drip into prepared holes. Refrigerate the cake layers
until the gelatin has jelled about 2 hours. Remove one cake layer
from its pan and place on a serving dish. Spread it with about 1 cup
of the whipped topping.  Remove the second layer and place it on top
of the first.  Cover it with whipped topping also.  Cover the sides,
if you have enough topping.  Refrigerate PREPARED cake for about 1
hour before serving. Garnish with fruit pieces, if you wish.  Cut
cake into 12 slices.
