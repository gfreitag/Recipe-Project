Title: Buttermilk Rolls`
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 servings
2 1/2 ts Active Dry Yeast
2 tb Warm Water (100 To 110 F)
1 c  Warm Buttermilk (100
-To 110 F)
1/4 c  Butter -- softened
1 lg Egg -- beaten
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking Soda
3 c  (Approx) Unbleached Flour
-Preferably Bread Flour
1 tb Milk -- for glaze
1. In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water and let stand
until creamy, about 10 mins; stir to dissolve. 2. In a large bowl,
mix the yeast mixture, buttermilk, butter, egg, sugar, salt, and
baking soda. Add 1 cup of the flour and beat to form a batter.
Gradually beat in enough of the remaining flour to form a dough that
is too stiff to stir. 3. On a lightly floured surface, knead the
dough, adding flour as needed to make a supple dough that isn't
sticky. Continue kneading until smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 mins.
Form into a ball and place in a lightly buttered large bowl. Turn
once to coat the top with butter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2
hrs. 4. Lightly butter a 10-inch round springform pan. Punch down the
dough. Knead briefly on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough
into 12 equal portions. Form each into a ball and place in the
prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until almost
doubled, about 45 mins. 5. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly brush
the tops of the rolls with milk. Bake until the rolls are golden
brown, about 15 to 20 mins. Cool slightly, then remove the sides of
the springform pan. Pull the rolls apart to serve. Makes 12 rolls
