1/4 c  Whipping cream
2    Egg yolks, room temperature
1 ts Coffee liqueur
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 sm Banana
3    Egg whites, room temperature
3 tb Sugar
Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 425F. Butter shallow 4-cup oval gratin pan. Dust with
sugar. Melt chocolate with cream in double boiler over barely
simmering water; stir until smooth. Remove from over water.
Immediately beat in yolks, then liqueur and cinnamon. (Can be
prepared 4 hours ahead. Press piece of plastic wrap onto surface to
prevent skin from forming. Before continuing, stir over barely
simmering water until just warm to touch.)

Arrange banana slices in prepared pan. Beat whites until soft peaks
form. Add 3 tb. sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of
whites into chocolate to lighten; carefully fold in remaining whites.
Gently spread over banana slices. Bake until puffed and just spring
to touch, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with
ice cream.
