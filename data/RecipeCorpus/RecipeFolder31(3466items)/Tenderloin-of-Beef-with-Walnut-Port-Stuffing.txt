3 lb Beef Tenderloin -

3 tb Dijon Mustard
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Butter - melted (1/2 stick)
FILLING: Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add
onion and saute until soft, about 6 minutes.  Mix in Port and cook
until liquid evaporates, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
Transfer onion mixture to medium bowl.  Add parsley, breadcrumbs,
walnuts, thyme and orange peel to mixture.  (Filling can be prepared
to this point 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
temperature before using.) Mix in egg.

FOR TENDERLOIN: Place meat on work surface. To butterfly, cut 2/3
through tenderloin down length of meat.   Open meat as for book.
Make another lengthwise cut down center of each cut side, cutting
1/3 through. Press to flatten.   Rub mustard over both sides of meat.
Season with salt and pepper.  Arrange meat cut side up.  Spread
filling over meat leaving 1-inch border on all sides.  Fold in half
lengthwise, enclosing filling. Tie string around tenderloin at 1-inch
intervals to hold shape. (Tenderloin can be prepared up to 6 hours
ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 400F.  Place
tenderloin in roasting pan and brush with butter. Roast until
thermometer inserted in thickest part of meat registers 120F for
rare, basting occasionally with butter, about 35 minutes. Let stand
10 minutes. Remove string and cut into 3/4-inch thick slices.

Serves 6.

Bon Appetit, February, 1991.

The only thing I would add to this is to let the tenderloin come to
room temperature after butterflying before proceeding. It will be
juicier when finished.

Bon Appetit says to accompany the tenderloin with some oven-roasted
potatoes and crusty French Bread.  Pour a rich red wine, such as a
Bordeaux or a Cabernet Sauvignon.
