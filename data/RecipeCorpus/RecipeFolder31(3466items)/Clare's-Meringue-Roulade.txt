This recipe needs a large baking tray, 45 cm x 30 cm (18'' x 12 '').
Use up the egg yolks by making a 'Creme Brulee'. The fruit filling
can be varied, you can also try Clare's 'Chestnut Syllabub' as
filling.

Preheat the oven to 180 oC/350 oF/gas mark 4. Line the baking tray
with greaseproof paper.

Whisk the egg whites until stiff. Continue whisking fast, then add the
caster sugar a spoonful at a time. >>> Continued to next message

>>> Continued from previous message The mixture should be thick and
white.

Using a serving spoon, fold in the icing sugar and cornflour and add
a few drops of vinegar.

Put into the baking tray, smooth and bake for 30 minutes or until set
on the top BUT STILL SOFT IN THE MIDDLE. Cool.

Mix the strawberries and mango in a bowl. Turn the meringue out
upside down onto a fresh greaseproof paper, then spread with whipped
cream.

Arrange the fruit evenly on the top and sprinkle with the grated
chocolate, if using. Holding the long ends, roll up fairly tightly
like a Swiss Roll and then, using both hands, lift onto a flat
serving dish.

Flurry with icing sugar, chill ana serve. Cut in slices like Swiss
Roll.
