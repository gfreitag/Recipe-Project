Categories: Herbs/spice, Information
Yield: 1 serving ?
1 lb Golden raisins
1 pt Gin (any kind)
Put raisins in a large bowl and cover with gin.  Let sit until gin
evaporates.  This takes about 7 days.  Once the gin is gone, put the
raisins in a jar and cover.  Every morning, eat 9 raisins--exactly
9--not 8 or 10, but 9!

It may take about a month before effect becomes noticeable.
