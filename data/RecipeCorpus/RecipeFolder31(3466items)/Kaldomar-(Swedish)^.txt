Categories: Meats, Rice, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Beef
1/2 lb Pork
1/2 c  Rice
Grated onion
Salt and pepper
1 lg Cabbage
Soak rice in cold water for about an hour, drain. While rice is
soaking, place a large head of cabbage in boiling water and let stand
until leaves are wilted and can be removed without breaking. Grind
together beef and pork. Mix in rice, onion salt and pepper. Wrap meat
carefully in cabbage leaves, place close together in kettle, cover
with cold water and boil slowly until done. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
