Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 pk Active Dry Yeast
2 1/4 c  Bread Flour
2 tb Brown Sugar
1 tb Dry Milk Powder
1 ts Cinnamon, Ground
1 ts Salt
1 c  Water
MMMMM-----------------------SWIRL FILLING----------------------------
1    Apple, Peeled, Cored & 1/4"
-Diced
3 tb Brown Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1 tb All Purpose Flour
1/4 ts Nutmeg
All ingredients should be at room temperature before starting. Add
all the dough ingredients to the pan in the order listed. Select
"White Bread". Press "Start".

Let the machine run all the way through the end of final kneading.
During the final knead, prepare a work area in which the dough will
be rolled out.

Combine and thoroughly blend the spiral filling ingredients.

After the machine stops kneading for the final time, remove the bread
pan with the dough in it.

PERSONAL NOTE: (this part depends on the machine you are using. -
with my Hitachi if I remove the bread pan the machine automatically
goes back to zero on the timer - what I do is just take the dough out
of the pan and leave the pan in place)

Working quickly, turn the dough out onto a well floured work area.
Roll the dough out to form a long but narrow (about half as wide as
the bread pan is tall) oblong of dough about  1/2" thick. Spread the
spiral filling ingredients over the top of the dough oblong. Roll the
dough up jelly-roll fashion. Return the dough cylinder to the bread
pan. Permit the machine to complete the rise and bake cycles
normally. ~!- Sharon Stevens
