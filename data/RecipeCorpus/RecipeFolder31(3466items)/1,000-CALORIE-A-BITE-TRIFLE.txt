passion fruit.  Place fruit in large trifle bowl and add an ample
quantity of sherry. Leave for twenty-four hours to soak in the
refrigerator.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream butter and sugar until light and
fluffy. Add eggs and about 2 T of flour and beat. Fold in rest of
flour. Bake in 7-inch square tin for 25-30 mins until brown. Let
cool. Slice into fingers and arrange on top of fruit. More sherry may
be added at this point.

Pour one large glass of sherry.  Mix eggs and add all ingredients to
small bowl.  Place bowl in pan of simmering water.  Stir continuously
with wooden spoon, sipping sherry, until custard thickens.  This
takes about ten minutes. Pour custard on top of sponge. Chill in
fridge. Whip cream until stiff and smooth over top of custard.
