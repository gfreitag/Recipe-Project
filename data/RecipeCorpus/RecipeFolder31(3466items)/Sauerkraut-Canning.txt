Title: Sauerkraut Canning
Categories: Vegetables, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
Fresh Cabbage
Coarse salt
Sugar
Glass jars
Let cabbage heads stand at room temperature for a day to prevent
breakage when shredding.  Trim off outer leaves and wash heads
quickly in cold water.  Cut heads in half and shred on kraut cutting
board (if you can find one), your favorite shredder or a sharp knife.

Pack shredded cabbage in clean glass jars, tamping down firmly with a
wooden spoon.  Fill jars very full so there is no air space at the
top. Add 1 tsp. pure coarse salt, and 1 tsp. sugar to each quart jar.
Then add boiling water to just cover cabbage.

Partially seal for first two weeks, and leave in a cool, dark place.
Refill jars after 2 weeks with a brine made of 1 tbsp. salt to 1 pint
of water. Now seal jars tightly and let fermentation continue. The
best kraut results when the jars are kept at a 70 degree temperature
or a little lower. It takes from 4 to 6 weeks to cure perfectly.
