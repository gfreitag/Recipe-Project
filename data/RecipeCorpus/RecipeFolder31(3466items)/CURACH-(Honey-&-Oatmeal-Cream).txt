Title: CURACH (Honey-&-Oatmeal Cream)
Categories: Desserts, Irish
Yield: 4 servings
2 oz Oatmeal, medium-grind
10 fl Cream, heavy
2 ts Honey, runny
3 ts Whiskey
12 oz Raspberries
Toast the oatmeal on a cookie sheet under the broiler, or in a hot
oven --watch it carefully and stir it from time to time--until it
turns a pale golden color.  Leave it to cool completely.

Whip the cream until it holds its shape, stir in the honey and
whiskey, then the cold toasted oatmeal. Layer the raspberries and the
cream mixture in the glasses, saving a few of the berries for
decoration on top. Serve slightly cool.
