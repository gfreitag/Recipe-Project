Title: Tangy Spinach Salad
Categories: Salads
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 lb Fresh Spinach
8 oz Fresh Bean Sprouts
8 1/2 oz Can Water Chestnuts, drained
And sliced
5 sl Bacon, fried, drained and
Crumbled
2    Hard-Cooked Eggs, sliced
2 tb Sesame Seeds, toasted
MMMMM-------------------TANGY SPINACH DRESSING------------------------
2/3 c  Salad Oil
1/4 c  Granulated Sugar
1/3 c  Catsup
1/2 c  White or Red Wine Vinegar
1/3 c  Green Onion, finely chopped
1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
Trim and discard tough spinach stems. Rinse leaves and pat dry. Tear
into bite-sized pieces. Layer the sprouts, water chestnuts and
spinach into your salad bowl (in that order, so that the spinach
leaves won't get sorry from being underneath the water chestnuts.) On
top of the spinach leaves, add the crumbled bacon and the chopped
egg. Cover and refrigerate.

Combine all the dressing ingredients in a jar or bowl. Shake, or
blend well with a wire whip.

Just before serving, pour dressing over the salad and toss well.
Sprinkle on toasted sesame seeds and toss again.

Note: To toast sesame seeds, place in a small, heavy, ungreased
skillet over medium-high heat. Toast until you hear the seeds begin
to pop, shaking the pan to keep the seeds from scorching.
