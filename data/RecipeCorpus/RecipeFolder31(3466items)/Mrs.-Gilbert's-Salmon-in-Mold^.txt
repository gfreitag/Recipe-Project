Categories: Fish, Tasteofhome, Depress/era

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 c  Milk
1 tb Cornstarch
Liquor from salmon
1 tb (large) butter, melted
Drain liquor from the fish, set aside. Chop fish fine and mix in the
butter. Beat eggs light and add crumbs. Mix well. Put into buttered
mold and steam 1 hour. Season to taste with salt, pepper and parsley.
Serve with sauce.

Sauce: Mix milk and cornstarch. Let come to a boil and cook until
thickened. Add salmon liquid and butter. Put egg in last (doesn't
say, but I'd assume one--C.S.) and carefully boil a minute to cook.
Pour over salmon and serve. A fancy way to have canned salmon.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
