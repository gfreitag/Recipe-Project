1/2 lb Minced pork
1    Slice stale bread
1 tb Butter; melted
Salt
Black pepper; freshly
- ground
3 1/2 tb Fine dry breadcrumbs
1    Onion; grated
1    Egg
2    Anchovy fillets; finely
- chopped
3 1/4 c  Beef stock
1    Egg yolk
1 tb Capers
Lemon juice; or
Wine vinegar
Trim the slice stale bread, soak it in water and squeeze it dry. In a
large bowl, combine the minced beef and pork with the bread, 1/2
tablespoon of the breadcrumbs, the onion, egg, anchovy fillets and
melted butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper and mix well.
Shape the mixture into 8 large meatballs.

Bring the stock to the boil in a large saucepan. Drop in the
meatballs and cook them for 15 to 20 minutes. Lift them out with a
slotted spoon and put them aside.

Stir the remaining breadcrumbs into the stock and simmer gently for a
few minutes to allow the stock to reduce and to thicken slightly.
Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolk lightly. Add a few tablespoons of the hot stock and
mix well. Stir the mixture back into the pan. Return the pan to low
heat and stir until the sauce has thickened. Take care not to let it
boil or the egg yolk will curdle.

Add the capers and a few drops of lemon juice or wine vinegar to
taste. Return the meatballs to the sauce and reheat gently, making
sure that the sauce does not boil. Serve in a ring of rice or
accompanied by a potato puree.

This dish originated in Koenigsberg, formerly the capital of East
Prussia. Berlin adopted it more than a century ago, however, and
Berliners have come to regard it as their own.
