* The smaller, sweeter Japanese eggplants are ideal for this dish,
but if they are not available use the standard variety.

Cut off the top and bottom ends of the eggplants and cut them
lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices.  (You should have about 8 slices.)
Rub the slices on both sides with the canola oil and sprinkle them
with the salt. Heat a grill until very hot.  Place the eggplant
slices on the grill and cook for 3 minutes on each side. Meanwhile,
combine the olive oil, soy sauce, and vinegar in a small bowl.
Arrange the salad greens on a platter and place the grilled eggplant
slices on top. Pour the sauce over both and serve immediatley.
