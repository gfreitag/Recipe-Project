Title: Wine Zucchini
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 lb Zucchini
1/2 c  Dry White Wine
1/2 c  Vegetable or Olive Oil
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground Pepper
1/4 ts Dried Tarragon

Cut zucchini lengthwise into 3/4" long strips. Cut across in 1/2"
pieces to make about 5-6 cups. Set aside while you bring wine, oil,
salt, pepper and tarragon to a boil. Add zucchini, bring to a boil

hours or overnight.

chicken or ribs.
