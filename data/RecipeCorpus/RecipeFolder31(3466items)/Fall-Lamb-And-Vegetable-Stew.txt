Title: Fall Lamb And Vegetable Stew
Categories: Crockpot, Meats, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Lamb stew meat
2    Tomatoes
1    Summer squash
1    Zucchini
1    Potatoes
1 cn Mushrooms -- sliced
1/2 c  Bell peppers -- chopped
1 c  Onions -- chopped
2 ts Salt
1 ea Garlic cloves -- crushed
1/2 ts Thyme leaves
1 ea Bay leaves
2 c  Stock -- chicken
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
Peel, seed, and chop tomatoes.  Slice summer squash and zucchini.
Dice potatoes.

Place lamb and vegetables in crockpot.  Mix salt, garlic, thyme, and
bay leaf into stock; pour over lamb and vegetables. Cover and cook on
low 8 hours.  (Don't peek.  Lifting the lid prolongs cooking time.)
Turn to high. Blend flour and butter, then shape into small balls.
Drop into stew and cook, stirring several times, until thickened.

Sylvia's comments: I bet this would be great without the lamb, too.
