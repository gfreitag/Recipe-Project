Title: Easy Strawberry Jam
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Granulated sugar
2 c  Strawberries; crushed
1 pk Powdered fruit pectin
3/4 c  Water
Stir sugar into strawberries. Set aside 10 minutes, stir
occasionally. Stir together fruit pectin and the water in a small
saucepan. Bring to boil on high heat, stirring constantly. Boil and
stir 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir pectin mixture into fruit
mixture. Stir constantly until sugar is completely dissolved and no
longer grainer, about 3 minutes. Pour into clean plastic containers
or jars to within 1/2-inch of top. (Use any size container, recipe
makes 4 cups, 1 quart in all.)

Cover. Let stand at room temperature 24 hours. Jam is now ready to
use. Store in refrigerator or freeze extra containers. Thaw in
refrigerator before using.

IMPORTANT Do not reduce amount of sugar or use sugar substitutes. The
exact amounts of sugar, fruit and pectin are necessary for a good set.

Note: A potato masher works best for crushing strawberries.
