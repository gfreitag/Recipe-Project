time: 30 to 45 minutes

Place first 11 ingredients in a 2 to 3 quart saucepan. Saute at
medium heat for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent
burning.

Add water and tamari soy sauce and bring mixture to a simmer.  Cook
for another 10 minutes or until vegetables are soft (tender crisp).

Add celery at end of cooking process to help retain color.

Mix arrowroot and water well.  Turn heat off under stew and
vigorously stir in arrowroot solution.  Turn heat on to medium and
stir constantly until mixture thickens.

Serve stew over noodles, rice or mashed potatoes, eliminate potatoes
in the stew and replace with frozen green peas, which could be added
at the same time as the celery to retain color.

*NOTE: The word "flaked" refers to a style of cut in which the food
medium is thinly sliced at a 45 degree angle.

This recipe has been developed by Bro. Ron Pickarski as part of his
work toward being a participant and finalist in the Culinary Olympics
held in Frankfurt, Germany.
