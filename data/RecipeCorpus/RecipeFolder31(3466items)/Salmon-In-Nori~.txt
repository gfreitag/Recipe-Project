Title: Salmon In Nori~
Categories: Asian, Fish, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Salmon *
1 ds Salt
3    Sheets dried nori **
2 tb Canola oil
1 1/2 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Lemon rind -- julienned
1 1/2 ts Balsamic vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper -- freshly
Ground
*  With a 4-by-8 inch piece of skin removed and reserved for
crackling. ** Dried seaweed sheets (Oriental Markets).

Wet the nori sheets on one side with water and place them, dampened
side up, on a flat work surface.  Place a strip of salmon at one end
of each sheet and roll it tightly, enclosing the salmon.  Cut each
roll in half and then cut each half into thirds.  You should have 6
slices per roll, or 18 slices in all. Arrange the nori-wrapped salmon
pieces on a plate and place in a steamer over boiling water. Cover
and steam for about 5 minutes, until the salmon is barely cooked,
even slightly rare in the center. Meanwhile, combine all the sauce
ingredients in a small bowl. Remove the salmon from the steamer and
arrange it on a serving plate.  Spoon some sauce over the salmon and
sprinkle some salmon skin crackling on top and serve.
