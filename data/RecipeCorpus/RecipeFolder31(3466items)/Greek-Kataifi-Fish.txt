Title: Greek Kataifi Fish
Categories: Greek, Fish
Yield: 4 servings
4    Fish fillets; snapper, trout
.  catfish or tilapia
1 pk Non-fat sour cream  (8oz)
1 tb Greek seasoning blend
.  such as Cavender's
3 dr Red pepper sauce
1/2 pk Katafi (shredded phyllo
.  dough)
3 tb Canola oil  (divided use)
Rinse the fish fillets and pat dry.  Combine the sour cream, Greek
seasoning and red pepper sauce.  Stir well to combine.  Coat the fish
on all sides with the sour cream mixture and set aside to marinate
for 10 to 15 minutes.

Kataifi must be thawed enough to separate.  Pull off about a third of
the shreds and tear into small pieces.  Arrange broken kataifi in an
even layer on a plate.

After the fish has marinated, dip each fillet into the kataifi shreds
on all sides.  Pat on to adhere and form an even coating.  Set aside.
Repeat with each fillet.

Heat a skillet over medium heat and add about 1 1/2 to 2 Tbsp oil.
Cook the fillets, 2 at a time, until golden on one side.  Carefully
turn and cook until golden and the fish is cooked through.  Repeat
with the remaining fillets, adding the remaining oil if needed. Allow
about 3 minutes cooking time for each 1/4-inch of thickness of the
fillets.

To eliminate most of the added fat:  Bake the fish in an oven
preheated to 375Ã¸F.  Place the coated fish fillets on a baking sheet
sprayed with non-stick spray.  Lightly spray the tops of the fillets
and place in the oven for about 5 minutes or until the fish turns
white and the edges of the kataifi turn golden.
