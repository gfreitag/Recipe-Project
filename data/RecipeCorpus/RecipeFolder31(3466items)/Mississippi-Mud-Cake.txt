sugar, 2 eggs, 2 C flour, 1 tsp soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 C milk. stir
well. Pour into greased 9x 12 or slightly larger pan..  Bake at 350
for 25 minutes. while baking, prepare icing: bring to boil: 1 stick
margarine, 6 T milk, 4 T cocoa. add one box Confectioner's. sugar,
beat til smooth but pourable. sprinkle top of baked cake with as many
pecans and mini marshmallows as your conscience can stand, gently
pour icing over hot cake. let stand 'til cool. This makes a brownie
like cake, VERY sweet! **This is one great cake.  I used buttermilk
for both the cake and icing and it seemed lighter that what the
recipe led me to believe.  The icing came up thick so I added a bit
of water.
