Title: Desperate Act Dinner
Categories: Pasta, Fatfree, Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Broccoli
1 ea Jar spaghetti sauce
1 ea Box "no yolk" (tm) "egg
Noodles"
bring "egg noodles" to a boil.  cook broccoli until tender but not
mushy (i hate over-cooked broccoli).  at the same time, heat up
spaghetti sauce. when the noodles and broccoli are cooked to your
preference, drain them and toss them together.  add sauce to taste.
voila!

the great thing about these noodles is that they're cholesterol free,
and low fat, to boot! i'm sorry i don't have any exact measurements.
i'm sure you can use your best judgement to gauge how much to
prepare. i don't know how much fat is in this concoction; all i know
is that the noodles are pretty low in fat grams, and that there are
some pretty good vlf spaghetti sauces out there (provided you add
enough basil and garlic!). happy spring, people!
