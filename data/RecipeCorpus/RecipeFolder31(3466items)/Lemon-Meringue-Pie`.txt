* Use 1/2 of the crust from the peach pie recipe. Prick the crust
with a fork on the sides and bottom. Bake on the bottom shelf of a
350 F oven for 20-25 mins, until golden brown. Combine 1 cup sugar,
the cornstarch, egg yolks, lemon rind, and 1/3 cup lemon juice. Mix
very well. Place all the ingredients in the top of a double boiler,
add the boiling water, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
mixture shrinks from the sides of the pot. When slightly cool, pour
the filling into the cooked pie shell. Beat the 6 egg whites with a
dash of salt until soft peaks form. Add 8 Tbs sugar, 2 tsp lemon
juice, and the cream of tartar. Beat until the whites are stiff.
Spoon the meringue over the lemon filling and press down with the
back of a spoon. Return the pie to the oven for 15 mins, or until the
meringue is golden.
