Title: Herman Wheat And Honey Sourdough Starter
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Honey -- * see note
1/3 c  Warm water
2 pk Yeast -- not instant
2 c  Milk
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  White flour
* You can use brown sugar instead of honey if you prefer.

Stir 1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar into warm water. Sprinkle
yeast over this.  Let stand in warm place until doubled in size;
about 10 minutes. Mix milk, remaining honey or brown sugar, flours
and yeast mixture. Place in a plastic or glass container about the
size of a 5-quart ice cream bucket. Stir, using only a wooden spoon
or paddle since metal retards growth. Cover loosely and let stand in
a warm place overnight. Place in refrigerator the next day.  Stir
each day with a wooden spoon to retard spoilage. On the fifth day,
measure out 1 cup to bake with and measure out 1 cup for a gift. Feed
remaining starter 1 cup white flour, 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup sugar.
Stir well then refrigerate.  Stir daily. On the tenth day, measure
out 1 cup to give to a friend. You should have enough left to use in
a recipe, plus extra to feed as before and then refrigerate.
Thereafter, use the starter almost daily or as desired, feeding every
fifth day.
