Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
8    Bacon rashers, rind removed
9 oz Boned chicken breasts

18 oz Chicken flesh
1 3/4 lb Belly or shoulder pork
3 tb Salt
1    Egg

Line a greased terrine dish or loaf tin with the bacon rashers. Cut
the chicken breasts into fine strips and marinate in the brandy while
making the rest of the terrine.

Mince the chicken flesh and pork together and place in a large bowl.
Add spices, seasoning and beaten egg and mix well.

Pack half the mixture into the bacon lined terrine and top with the
shredded chicken breast meat which has been marinating in the brandy.

Fill the terrine with the remainder of the mince and fold over the
rashers on top of the mixture. Slide the bay leaves under the rashers.

Bake with the lid on (or covered with foil if using a loaf tin) in a
pan of water at 175 deg. C for 2 hours.

Allow to cool, still covered, and then refrigerate.

Serve with crusty French bread.
