Title: Sourdough Starter`
Categories: Breads, Cowboy
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Unbleached Flour, Organic
Stone-Ground -- preferred
2 c  Water
2 1/2 ts Active Dry Yeast
1. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, water, and yeast until
a thin batter forms. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at
room temperature, stirring once a day, for at least 24 hrs and up to
48 hrs. If the liquid that forms on the top, (at any time) turns
pinkish, discard the entire batch of starter and begin again.

2. Rinse a 1-qt jar with boiling water. Stir the starter well and
transfer to the jar and cover tightly with the lid. The starter is
now ready to use but will improve in flavor if refrigerated for at
least 3 days. The older the starter is, the stronger the flavor, and
the better the bread. If a brownish liquid rises to the top of the
starter, just stir it back in before using. (It's only the alcohol
forming as a by-product of the fermentation process.)

3. To use the starter, rinse out a metal measuring cup with warm water
(this discourages sticking). Use a level measured amount. Replace the
amount of starter used with an equal amount of flour and water in
50-50 proportions. For example, if you use 1 cup of starter, stir 1/2
cup each of flour and water into the jar of remaining starter. Cover
loosely with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 24
hours to ferment. Cover with the lid and refrigerate until ready to
use again.

4. If the starter is not used within 10 days, it must be replenished.
Discard (or use) 1 cup of starter. Stir 1/2 cup each flour and water
into the remaining starter, and let stand as above. If you feed your
starter faithfully every 2 weeks, it should last indefinitely. Makes
about 2 1/2 cups starter from Garnet and Helen Brooks of -B (Bar B)
Brand, El Reno, OK.
