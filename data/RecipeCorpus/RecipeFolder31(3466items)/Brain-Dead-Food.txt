Title: Brain Dead Food: Quesadillas Sans Queso
Categories: Vegetables, Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1 cn Fatfree refried beans
1 ea Low fat tortillas (ww or
Corn)
Turn the oven on hot (I use a pizza stone, but I'm sure it's not
necessary).  Open a can of fatfree refried beans and spread thinly on
half of a low-fat tortilla (whole wheat or corn).  Fold the other
half the tortilla over the beans, and smash down.  Make several.
Bake until slightly crispy, turning once if desired.  To eat, dip in
salsa.  These are kind of like quesadillas without the queso.
