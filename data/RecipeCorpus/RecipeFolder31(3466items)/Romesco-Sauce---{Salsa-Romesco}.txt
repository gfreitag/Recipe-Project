Comments: Romesco is a specialty of the province of Tarragona, where
contests are held in which over two dozen chefs may compete for the
championship of Romesco making. The peppery sauce is used primarily
with fish, but is good with vegetables and excellent for basting
grilled mutton chops.  The sauce can be made in an electric blender
in less than 5 minutes and comes out very well, although chefs
competing in the Romesco contest always use a mortar and pestle,
which, they say, extract more oil from the nuts.
