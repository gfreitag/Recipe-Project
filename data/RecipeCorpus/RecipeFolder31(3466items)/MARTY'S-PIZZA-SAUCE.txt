Title: MARTY'S PIZZA SAUCE
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Italian
Yield: 2 servings
8 oz Can tomato sauce
6 oz Can tomato paste
1 tb Olive oil
2 tb Water
1 lg Clove garlic, pressed
1 tb Oregano
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1/8 ts Crushed dried hot red
Chili peppers
Place all ingredients in a covered saucepan over lowest heat,
stirring now and then, cook for 20 minutes. Use on pizza dough,
French bread, or English muffins, top with shredded mozzarella cheese
and other favorite toppings. I usually prepare a double recipe when I
make pizza and save the left over sauce for French bread or muffins
the same week. Keep sauce refrigerated.
