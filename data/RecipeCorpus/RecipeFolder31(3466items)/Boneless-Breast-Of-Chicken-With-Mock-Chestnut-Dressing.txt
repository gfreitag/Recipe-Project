stuffing. Combine all stuffing ingredients. Place 2 heaped
tablespoons of stuffing in the center of each chicken breast. Wrap
chicken around stuffing and shape into an oval.

In a Dutch oven, or skillet with a cover, saute onion, bay leaf and
green pepper in oil untilonion is tender. Add stuffed breasts, seam
side down, and cook uncovered over medium heat for 15 minutes. Add
water and soup powder or bouillon cubes. Cover and simmer for about
15 more minutes. Thicken gravy by disolving flour in cold water and
stirring into pan until thickened and smooth. Baste breasts 2-3
times. Place a pepper ring and a mushroom cap on top of each breast.
Cover and cook over low heat for an additional 15 minutes.

OVEN METHOD:

Roast stuffed breasts, seam side down, uncovered in a preheated 375F
oven for 20 minutes. Top each breast with a pepper ring and a
mushroom cap, and continue roasting for 20-30 minutes. Baste
occasionally.
