Title: Spring Risotto with Artichokes and Peas
Categories: Rice, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Butter
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Finely chopped onion
2 md Cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
4 c  Chicken broth, combined with
1 cup water, heated
1    14 oz. can artichoke hearts,
Drained and quartered
Grated peel of one lemon
1/2 c  Frozen peas, defrosted
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Chopped fresh dill
1/4 c  Finely chopped parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the butter and oil over medium
heat. Add the onion and garlic; saute until softened, about 5
minutes.  Stir in the rice and cook, stirring 2 minutes.

2. Slowly start to add the liquid, about a ladleful at a time.  Cook,
covered, over low heat, 10 minutes.  Wait until the liquid has been
absorbed each time before adding the next ladleful.  Repeat the
cooking process, covered, 10 minutes.  Uncover and stir in the
artichokes and lemon peel.  Continue cooking, uncovered, adding the
liquid slowly and stirring often.  The risotto should cook a total of
about 30 minutes. (The finished risotto should be creamy, with a
little bite at the center of the rice.)

3. During the last few minutes of cooking time, stir in the peas,
lemon juice, dill, parsley and salt and pepper to taste.  (Depending
on the saltiness of the broth used, the risotto may not need
additional salt.)

4. Stir in the Parmesan just before serving.
