Yield: 100 tomatoes
6 pt Firm cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tb Basil
1 ts Sugar

1. Preheat oven to 300F. Line 2 heavy baking sheets with parchment
paper. Spread the halved cherry tomatoes on the parchment-lined
baking sheet, cut sides up. In a small bowl, combine the basil,
sugar, salt and pepper and sprinkle evenly over the cherry tomatoes.

Serve chilled or at room temperature.

Note: Blend with dilled lime cream cheese to make a tasty dip.
