Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 cake
1 1/2 c  Sifted all purpose flour
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
3/8 ts Salt
1    Egg
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Low fat buttermilk
1 1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Stick margerine
1 tb Unsalted butter
1 c  Granulated sugar
Have all ingredients at room temp.  Adjust oven racks to divide oven
into thirds; preheat oven to 325.  Spray a 5c loaf pan; bundt or tube
pan with nonstick cooking spray.

In small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and
salt; sift together and set aside.

In small bowl, whisk together egg and egg whites; set aside.

In small bowl combine buttermilk and vanilla; set aside.

Cut margerine and butter into 1/4 inch chunks and place in large bowl
of an electric mixer; beat at medium speed until softened, about 1
min.  Add sugar gradually, beating constantly, until smooth, about 3
mins. Gradually dribble in beaten eggs, beating at med high speed for
2-3 mins. On low speed, beat in 1/3 of the reserved flour mixture,
scraping sides of bowl. On med high speed, gradually dribble in 1/2
of buttermilk mixture, scraping sides of bowl.  On low speed, beat in
half the remaining flour mixture. On med high speed, beat in the rest
of buttermilk mixture, scraping sides of bowl.  On low speed, beat in
remaining flour mixture until well combined--batter may look slightly
curdled.  Pour into prepared pan and bake until cake starts to pull
away from the sides of the pan, the top is golden brown and a
toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean--35-40
min for bundt or tube pan or 65-70 for the loaf pan.

Cool on rack 10-15 mins; invert pan and unmold on rack to cool
completely. Cut into 12 slices.
