Categories: Breads, Tasteofhome
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  All-Purpose Flour -- sifted
1 1/2 tb Sugar
2 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Yellow Cornmeal
2    Eggs -- beaten
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Butter -- melted
Preheat oven to 425 F. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt. Add cornmeal. In a medium-size bowl mix eggs,
buttermilk, and butter. Add flour mixture. Mix enough to moisten.
Pour into a greased 8-inch-square baking pan or 12 muffin tins. Bake
for 20 to 25 mins (15 to 20 mins for muffins), or until golden and
firm to the touch in the center. Cut corn bread into squares.

Yield: 12 squares or muffins. Double recipe for 10 to 12 guests.

Variation: Blend a small cooked sweet potato or mashed banana into
the corn bread batter, for an interesting change of pace.
