Title: Grilled Polenta
Categories: Italian, Nuts/grains, Bbq/grill, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Salt
2 c  Coarse yellow cornmeal
6 tb Unsalted butter
*  The Polenta is cooked and molded the night before *

(1) Spray a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.

(2) In a large sauce-pan, bring 6-1/2 cups of water and the salt to a
boil over high heat. Gradually whisk in the cornmeal until thoroughly
incorporated. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly,
until the cornmeal becomes a smooth porridge, about 20 minutes.

(3) Stir in 2 tablespoons of the butter. Scrape the polenta into the
prepared pan and smooth the top. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate
overnight.

(4) Preheat the broiler. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a
large baking pan with 1" sides. Tilt to coat the bottom of the pan.

(5) Unmold the polenta from the loaf pan. Cut off and discard about
1/2" of the top to remove the crust. Cut the loaf crosswise into 16
slices 1/2" thick. Arrange the polenta slices close together on the
baking pan, turning to coat each one with melted butter.

(6) Broil about 6" from the heat for 7 minutes, or until the tops are
bubbly and beginning to brown. Turn and brown the other side. The
polenta should be crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.
Serve at once.
