Title: Sugar Peas and New Potatoes
Categories: Vegetables, Potatoes, Side dish, Penndutch
Yield: 6 servings
1 qt Sugar peas with edible pods
14 ea Tiny new potatoes
2 c  Water
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Milk or cream
2 tb Butter; more if you like
String the washed sugar peas. (This is quickly done by cutting off
the smallest end of the pod and pulling the string down the straight
side. The other side can then be pulled from the blossom end.) Scrub
the potatoes well and pare if you like- it is not necessary.
In one saucepan bring the peas and potatoes to a boil in 2 cups of
water with salt and sugar added. Cook for 35 minutes. Add the milk or
cream and butter. Keep over heat 1 minute more, then serve.
