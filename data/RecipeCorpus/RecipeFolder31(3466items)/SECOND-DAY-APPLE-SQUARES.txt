Title: SECOND DAY APPLE SQUARES
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 12 servings
2 c  White flour, unbleached
2 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 c  Butter (or margarine)
1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
2 ts Cinnamon (or less)
1 ts Soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Sour cream (or yogurt)
1 ts Vanilla extract
1    Egg
2 c  Apples, peeled and
-finely chopped
-(about 2 apples)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the flour,
brown sugar and margarine.  Blend at low speed, until the mixture
forms fine crumbs. If you want to include them, stir in the nuts now.
Place about 2 3/4 cups of the crumb mixture into an ungreased pan,
about 13 x 9 inches. Press down firmly.

Add the remaining ingredients (except for the apples) to the remaining
crumb mixture. Blend well. Stir the chopped apples into the batter.
Spoon the batter evenly over the crumb base in the pan. Bake at 350
degrees F. for 30-40 minutes. If you use the larger pan, bake for
25-30 minutes. Cool before cutting.  Better yet, let it wait 24 hours
before cutting.  Store loosely covered.

NOTES:

*  Sugary, moist apple squares -- Try to avoid eating very many of
these squares on the day you make them, as they improve immeasurably
on the second and third day! This recipe originally came from a
Pillsbury bake-off. Yield: Makes 12-15 squares.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
