Title: Mock Calizone
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Muffins
Yield: 1 servings

Split and Toast English Muffin Halves.  On each Muffin place Ham, two
or three tablespoons Ricotta Cheese, and a good slice of Mozzarella
Cheese. Place on a cookie sheet lined with foil and put in a 400
degree oven until the cheese is melted.  It works a little better if
the ham slices are hot. It can be leftover smoked ham, or sliced ham
from the Deli. Shared by: Pat Stockett
