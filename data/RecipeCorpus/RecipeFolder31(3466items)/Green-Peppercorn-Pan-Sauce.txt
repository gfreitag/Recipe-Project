Title: Green Peppercorn Pan Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
Pan juices from a roast
2    Shallots -- minced
1/2 c  Cognac
2 c  Brown stock
Roux
2 tb Green peppercorns --
Bottled
1/3 c  Heavy cream
Skim all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the pan juices in the
roasting pan.  Add the shallots, and cook over moderately low heat,
stirring, until they are softened.  Add the Cognac and deglaze the
pan over moderately high heat, scraping up the brown bits.  Add the
stock, bring the liquid to a boil, stirring, and reduce it to about
1-1/2 cups. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a heavy
saucepan, bring to a boil, and whisk in bits of the roux until the
mixture is thickened. Flatten 1 tablespoon of the peppercorns with
the flat side of a knife, add them with the remaining 1 tablespoon
peppercorns to the mixture, and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer the
sauce for 3 minutes and add salt and pepper to taste.
