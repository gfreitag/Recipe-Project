NOTES:

*  A make-it-yourself mix for buttermilk pancakes -- This recipe
comes from the "More Make-a-mix Cookery" cookbook put out by HP
Books.  The premise of this book and its predecessor, Make-a-mix
Cookery is that you can save time and money by making your own mixes
for every stage of dinner planning.  It seems to work.  Yield:  10
cups of mix of mix.

*  Use the mix within 6 months of when you make it.

*  The pancakes made from this mix aren't as sweet as those made from
Aunt Jemima mix, but they are good.  You can always add sugar, of
course.

*  Although we haven't tried this (yet), you could probably vary the
recipe by using a different type of flour to make, for example, your
own buckwheat pancakes.

*  If you can't find buttermilk powder in your local grocery store,
try a bulk food store.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes to make the mix if you have the ingredients.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
