A recipe for people who grow their own peas, and can't bear to waste
the least result of their hard work. Only fresh, juicy pods should be
used.

Put peas pods into a large pan, and cover them generously with water.
Boil until the green part of the pods is soft. Put through the
mouli-legumes (the tough white papery parts will be left behind).
Meanwhile in another pan, melt the butter and sweat the onions until
softened without browning them. Add the pea pod liquid, and the
savory; season well and simmer until the onions are cooked.
Liquidize or sieve the soup and return to the pan to reheat. Pour a
little of the hot, almost boiling soup into a bowl, in which you have
beaten the egg yolk with the cream. Whisk well and return to the pan.
Stir over a gentle heat until the soup thickens a little, but don't
let it boil or the egg will curdle. Correct the seasoning. Serve with
the chives snipped over the soup.

NOTE; if a few peas can be spared, add them when the strained pod
liqor is amalgamated with onions and savory. The flavour will be even
more delicious.
