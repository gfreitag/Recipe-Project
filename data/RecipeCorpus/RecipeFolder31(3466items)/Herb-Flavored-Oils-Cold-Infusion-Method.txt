Title: Herb Flavored Oils-Cold Infusion Method
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 3 /4 cup
2 c  Tightly packed
-soft-leafed green herb
-(such as basil, chervil,
-chives, cilantro, mint)
1 c  Olive oil
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add herbs and make sure to
push the leaves under the boiling water. Blanch herbs for 5 seconds.
Drain into a strainer and immediately plunge into a bowl of ice
water. Drain well and squeeze out all the liquid. Pure in a blender
with olive oil.

Strain pure immediately through a fine-mesh strainer such as a china
cap. Strain again through 4 layers of cheesecloth and put in a
sterilized glass bottle. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Use within 1
week for optimum flavor.

Note 1: For best results, choose very fresh herbs with strong flavors
and an olive oil with a clean, neutral taste. A blender makes a
finer, smoother pure than a food processor and extracts more flavor.
Some oil will be lost during filtering depending on how tightly it
binds to the flavoring ingredients.

Note 2: Tarragon does not work very well except early in the spring
when it is very sweet, otherwise it tends to taste bitter when
infused.

Note 3: Make sure to squeeze all the water out of the cheesecloth or
filter papers before use.
