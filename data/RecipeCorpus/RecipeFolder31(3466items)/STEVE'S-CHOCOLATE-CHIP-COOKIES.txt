Title: STEVE'S CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
Categories: Cake/cookie, Usenet
Yield: 2 dozen
1/2 lb Butter (2 sticks)
1 1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
2    Eggs
2 ts Vanilla extract
2 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 ts Baking soda
1 lb Chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream butter and sugar in a mixing
bowl until creamy. Spend some time and make sure it is well mixed.
Add eggs and vanilla and mix well. Add flour and soda, again mixing
well. Add chocolate chips. If it doesn't look like enough, then add
some more.

Make big, thick cookies, big enough so that you get only 2 dozen of
them out of this recipe. Put them on a lightly-greased baking sheet.
Put the cookies in the oven, close the door quickly, and turn the
heat down to 350 degrees F. Bake for 10 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Rich, thick, crunchy chocolate chip cookies.  Yield:  makes 2
dozen.

*  The use of real ingredients instead of imitation ingredients
cannot be overemphasized.  Chocolate-flavored chips, margarine,
vanilla flavoring and other such atrocities will completely destroy
this recipe.  I use Challenge butter and Ghirardelli chocolate.

: Difficulty:  easy if you have a machine that can cream sugar and
butter, moderate otherwise.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking, 10 minutes
cooling. : Precision:  measure the ingredients.
