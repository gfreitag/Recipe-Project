Title: Bodle Burgers
Categories: Sandwich, Bbq/grill, Seafood, Fish
Yield: 1 bodlefull
1 lb Fresh squid (Reserve Liquor)
1/4 lb Tofu
1/8 ts Cayenne
1/4 ts Thyme
*The squid we get here is already cleaned, cut up and packed in
water. If you use fresh squid there will not be any liquor. The
moisture from the tofu will hold it together.

Put squid in a blender a little at a time.  Chop up real fine. Add
enough liquor to keep moist; but not wet and add tofu a little at a
time until well blended. Form into 1/4 pound patties.  Baste with
your favorite bbq sauce as you cook them on your bbq.  About 2
minutes on each side should be enough. Serves 4.
