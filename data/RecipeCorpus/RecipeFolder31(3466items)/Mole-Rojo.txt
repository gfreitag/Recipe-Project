1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Sesame seeds
4    Cloves

Boil chilies and garlic in 1 quart water until very soft.  Strain off
1/3 of liquid and reserve.  In a food processor, puree chilies and
garlic along with oregano leaves until very smooth.  Pass mixture
through a fine strainer. Over high heat reduce red wine with chopped
shallots until liquid is almost gone. In a nonstick pan, toast
cloves, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds over medium heat. Add reserved
liquid from chilies and reduced red wine mixture, stirring to mix. In
separate saucepan make a brown roux by cooking flour and olive oil
over medium-low heat, stirring continuously until golden brown.
Combine pureed, strained chile mixture and reduced mixture with roux.
Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. Adjust
consistencey with hot chicken broth to make more saucy, if desired.
Serve with cooked turkey, chicken, pork or beef. NOTE: Any mild, red
chili can be substituted for the Huajillo chilies if they can't be
found.
