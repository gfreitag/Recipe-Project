1. To prepare the marinated salmon: Cut salmon fillet crosswise into 4
pieces; pour into a glass pan.  Combine two tablespoons teriyaki
sauce,
lemon juice and mint.  Pour over the salmon and refrigerate one
hour.

2. To prepare the vegetables: Heat oil over a nonstick skillet set
over
medium heat.  When hot, add the mushrooms and ginger; saute until
softened, about four minutes.  Add the mint and 1 tablespoon
teriyaki
sauce and bring to a boil.  Saute 1 minute.  Remove from the pan.

3. To prepare the steaming liquid: Put the water, mint, lemon and
ginger
into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat slightly so
that
the liquid remains at a low boil.  Fit a steamer basket or rack
over
the top.  Lay the romaine leaves on top, cover and steam 4 minutes,
until wilted.  Remove the lettuce from the steamer.

4. Remove the salmon from the marinade. (Discard the marinade.)
Spoon the
mushrooms over each piece of salmon and wrap each in 2 of the
steamed
romaine leaves.  Place on the steamer and steam twelve minutes per
inch
of thickness.  Test the salmon in the center for doneness.

5. While the salmon is steaming, prepare the sauce: Stir together the
teriyaki sauce, lemon juice, sugar and mint.  Serve on the side of
the
salmon.
