Title: Garlic-Stuffed Pot Roast`
Categories: Meats, Cowboy
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Garlic -- finely chopped
1 ts Ground Hot Red (Cayenne)
Pepper
1 ts Salt
1    (4 Lb) Boneless Bottom Round
-Roast
3 tb Vegetable Oil
3 c  Beef Stock, Prefer Homemade
Or Low-Sodium
1. In a small bowl, combine the garlic, red pepper, and salt. Using
the tip of a sharp knife, cut 1-inch-wide pockets, about 2 inches
deep, all over the surface of the meat. Stuff the pockets with the
garlic mixture. Scrape away any of the garlic mixture on the outside
of the roast, or it will burn during browning.

2. In a large flameproof casserole, heat the oil over medium-high
heat. Add the roast and cook, turning often, until browned on all
sides, about 10 mins. Transfer the roast to a plate.

3. Pour off the excess fat. Add the stock to the casserole and bring
to a boil over high heat, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom
of the casserole with a wooden spoon. Return the roast to the
casserole and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer, turning the
roast occasionally, until tender, about 2 hrs.

4. Let stand for 10 mins before carving. Serve the roast with the
juices poured over.

NOTE: The roast can also be prepared outside in a 12-inch Dutch oven.

Makes 8 to 10 servings from Robert L. "Buck" Reams of Ft. Worth, TX.
