double boiler filled with 1 inch of boiling water. Continue stirring
and cook the mixture for 5 mins longer. Place egg yolks in a bowl and

For the meringue: Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until soft
peaks form. Add the sugar, a couple of Tbs at a time, beating after
each addition. Continue beating until stiff peaks form. Pour custard
into pie shell. Top with meringue, making peaks here and there. Bake
for 8 to 10 mins, until meringue is a golden brown.
