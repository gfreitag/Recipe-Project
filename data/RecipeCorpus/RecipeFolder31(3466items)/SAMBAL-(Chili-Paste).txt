Sambal is to Indonesian cuisine what salsa is to Mexican cooking: a
fiery-hot condiment served at every meal.

In a blender or food processor, combine chiles, garlic, onion, sugar,
lemon juice, water and salt; whirl until onions are finely minced.
Pour mixture into a 1 to 2 quart pan and cook over medium heat,
stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1/2 cup (about 10
minutes). Serve at room temperature.
