This is a Tunisian specialty called 'farka'. It is generally served
for breakfast or as an afternoon snack, rather than an after dinner
dessert.

Place couscous in a large bowl. Bring 2 2/3 cups water, 1/2 cup sugar
and oil to a boil in a large saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar.
Pour mixture over couscous and stir until well blended. Cover and let
stand 10 minutes, fluff grains with fork to separate. Mix nuts and
dates into couscous. Transfer couscous to a 13x9x2 inch baking dish.
Preheat oven to 350 F. and bake couscous until heated through 10-20
minutes. Spoon into bowl, serve with hot milk and additional sugar.
