Title: Potato Rice Pancakes
Categories: Fatfree, Side dish
Yield: 1 recipe
1 1/2 c  AM Brown Rice Flour
1/2 c  AM Potato Flakes
1 tb Non-alum baking powder
1 ts Sea salt (optional)
3 tb AM Unrefined Vegetable Oil
2 c  Water or soymilk
2    Eggs (optional)
Mix dry and liquid ingredients separately; then combine and stir
well. Pour small amounts of batter onto a hot, non-stick griddle and
bake. Serve with syrup or gravy.

NOTE: this recipe does not work well for waffles.  The addition of
eggs gives them more the consistency of wheat flour pancakes.
