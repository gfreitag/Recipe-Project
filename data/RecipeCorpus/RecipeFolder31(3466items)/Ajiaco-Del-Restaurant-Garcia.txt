Title: Ajiaco Del Restaurant Garcia
Categories: Poultry, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Butter
1 ts Cayenne Pepper
1 c  Unsalted Chicken Stock
4    Ears Yellow Corn, shucked,
Sliced into 1" wheels
3 lb Chicken Breasts, cut up
2 ts Sweet Paprika
1 c  Onions, finely diced
3 c  Milk
2 lg Yucca, peeled and diced
1    Lime, juiced
Melt the butter in a 6 qt. pot over medium heat. Cook chicken pieces
in the butter until no longer pink. Remove chicken with slotted spoon
and place in in a bowl. Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in
pot and cook while stirring, until onion is translucent and colored
with the paprika. Add stock, milk, yucca, corn, and chicken to the
pot. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat, cover and simmer,
stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yucca is
tender. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or
French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden.

As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh
frozen kernels. The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to
this dish.

If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em
up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.
