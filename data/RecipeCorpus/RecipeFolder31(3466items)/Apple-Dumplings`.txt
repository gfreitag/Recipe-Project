Categories: Breakfast, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Crisco
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking Powder
1/2 c  (Up To) Milk
4    Tart Apples (Jonathan,
Granny Smith, Rome) -- peel
Cored, halved
4 ts Unsalted Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Light Brown Sugar
Syrup-----
2    Apples -- peeled and sliced
ds Almond Extract
1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
1 tb Unsalted Butter
1 tb Lemon Juice
1/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
1 tb Cornstarch To Thicken Syrup
If needed
With a spoon, mix the Crisco, flour, salt, and baking powder to a
crumbly consistency. Add enough milk to form a soft dough. Divide the
dough into 4 pieces and roll each out into 8" circles, or circles big
enough to enclose the apples. Place 2 halves of an apple together in
each piece of the dough. Add 1 tsp of butter to the hollow between
the halves. Combine the sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar, and
sprinkle into the hollows. Enclose the apples with the dough, leaving
an opening at the top, and place open side up in a baking pan. Bake
in a 350 F oven about 45 mins, or until the apples are done.
Meanwhile, make a syrup by heating the syrup ingredients, including
any leftover filling, uncovered, in a pan until the apples are soft
and the sugar is dissolved. Add cornstarch to thicken, if necessary.
After the apples have been baking for about 20 mins, baste the
dumplings with the syrup mixture, spooning on the syrup mixture at
10-mins intervals. Continue baking about 25 mins more, or until the
crust is golden.
