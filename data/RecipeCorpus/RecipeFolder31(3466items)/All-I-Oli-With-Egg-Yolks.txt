2 dr Cool water -- a few drops
Salt -- to taste
Put a few drops of cool water and a few drops of lemon juice or
vinegar in a mortar with the garlic.  Mash garlic well.  Add raw egg
yolks and blend. While stirring tirelessly in the same direction, add
olive oil very gradually.  Blend in additional lemon juice or
vinegar. Salt to taste. This recipe makes 1 1/2 cups of sauce.
Comments: All-i-oli is easy to make providing certain rules are
observed, rules equally applicable to mayonnaise. The ingredients,
particularly the olive oil, must be at room temperature. The oil must
be be added very gradually and the sauce must be stirred in the same
direction all the while. All-i-oli will keep several days under
refrigeration. Recipe Source: THE SPANISH COOKBOOK by Barbara Norman
