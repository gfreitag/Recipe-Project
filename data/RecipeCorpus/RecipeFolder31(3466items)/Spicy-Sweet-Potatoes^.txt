Title: Spicy Sweet Potatoes^
Categories: Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
2 lg Sweet potatoes
1/4 c  Nutmeats, chopped
2 tb Butter
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/8 ts Cloves
1/8 ts Cinnamon
Sifted flour
Fat for deep frying
Boil, peel and mash potatoes. Add nuts, butter, salt, nutmeg, cloves
and cinnamon. Beat till well blended. Gently form into balls.
Carefully roll in flour. Deep fry in hot fat until golden brown.
Serve very hot. These are good with pork roast or chicken. Or they'll
do fine by themselves.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
