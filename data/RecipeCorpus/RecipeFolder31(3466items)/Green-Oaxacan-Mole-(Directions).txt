Categories: Poultry, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Put the chicken pieces into a pan; add the garlic and onion with
water to cover and salt to taste.  Bring to a simmer and continue
simmering until the meat is just tender.  Strain, reserving the
broth.  Add water or reduce to make 4 cups broth.

Prepare 1 recipe chochoyotes and set aside.

Remove the jusks from the tomate verde, rinse briefly, and chop
roughly. Put into a blender jar with the water.  Add the garlic,
onion, oregano, cumin seed, cloves, allspice, and fresh chiles and
blend until smooth. Heat the lard in a heavy pan or saute pan, add
the blended ingredients, and fry over fairly high heat, stirring from
time to time, until reduced and well seasoned - about 15 minutes.
Blend the tortilla masa with 1 cup of the chicken broth until smooth
and stir into the pan with 2 more cups of the broth. Cook over medium
heat, simmering until the sauce begins to thicken - about 10 minutes.

Add the chochoyotes one by one, make sure they are well covered by the
sauce, and simmer for a frew moments while you prepare the greens.

Put the greens with 1 1/2 cups water into a blender jar and blend as
smoothly as possible.  If the greens are tough and stringy, strain
through a sieve into the pan, pressing the debris firmly so that all
the juice and soft matter are extracted.  Stir gently - you don't
want to break up the dumplings - taste for salt, and cook for 10
minutes longer or until the dumpling dough is cooked.
