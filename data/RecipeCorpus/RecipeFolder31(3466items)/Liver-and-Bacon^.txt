Title: Liver and Bacon^
Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
4 sl To 8 bacon
1 lb Liver
2 tb Flour
Salt and pepper
1 c  Hot water
Put bacon in a cold skillet an cook till crisp. Remove from pan. Roll
liver in flour, salt and pepper. Fry quickly in hot bacon fat. Put on
hot platter, put bacon on top. Pour off fat except for 2 tablespoons.
Stir in flour, add water gradually and boil for 1 minute. Season and
pour around meat. Liver should not be overcooked, and should be
served immediately. Try serving this with fried onions on top. Many
of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
