Title: LAMB VINDALOO
Categories: Meats, Indian, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Lamb, cubed
2 tb Coriander seed
1 tb Cumin seed
2 lb Tomatoes, crushed
14    Garlic cloves, crushed
6    Bay leaves
Ginger (fresh), 2 inches,
-finely chopped
1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
1/2 ts Cardamon seed
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Cayenne
2 ts Mustard seed, ground
1 tb Turmeric
1 c  Wine vinegar
2 md Onions
2 md Potatoes
2 tb Butter
Lightly roast the cumin seed and coriander seed by frying with no oil
for a minute or so, stirring constantly.  Grind these and combine
them into a paste with the other spices, the garlic, ginger and the
vinegar. Add the lamb to the marinade and mix well. Refrigerate for
3-24 hours while mixing every few hours as convenient.

Finely chop the onions and potatoes and saute them for 5 minutes in
the butter.

Add lamb and spice paste and simmer over low heat for half an hour.
The marinating does add a lot of flavor and makes the meat much more
tender. This can be skipped if need be.

NOTES:

*  A spicy hot Indian lamb dish -- Very loosely based on Dharamjit
Singh's recipe in "Indian Cookery:  A Practical Guide."  Most
restaurants that serve this dish pronounce it vinDAloo, with the
stress on the second syllable.

: Difficulty:  easy (though it's easy to burn the spices while
roasting them).
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 1 day marinating, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
