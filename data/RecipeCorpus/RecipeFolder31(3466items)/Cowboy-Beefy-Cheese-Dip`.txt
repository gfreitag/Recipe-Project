Worcestershire sauce and cook until tomato juices are almost
completely evaporated, about 5 mins.

bowl works best to hold the heat and serve warm, with tortilla chips
for dipping. (The dip can be made up to 1 day ahead, then cooled,
covered, and refrigerated. Reheat in the top part of a double boiler
over boiling water.) Makes 8 to 12 servings from Clem and Donna
