"If you have a walnut tree, try this unusual English recipe which uses
green walnuts.  They should be picked in June or July, before the
shell has formed and can harden in the pickle.  If you push a thin
skewer or knitting needle into the nut, you will be able to feel when
the shell is beginning to form.  Be sure to wear rubber gloves as
walnuts stain badly. Pickled walnuts are generally served with cold
meats and are an excellent alternative to ripe olives for decoration."

green walnuts

Boil the water and pour in the salt to make the brine.  Stir well to
dissolve and cool before using. Wearing rubber gloves, prick the
walnuts all over with a thin skewer or metal knitting needle. Put
them into a bowl and cover with brine.  Put a plate on top of the
walnuts to keep them under the surface and leave 5 -6 days in a cool
place. Drain, cover again with fresh brine and leave for another
week. Drain well, spread on a tray and leave in a warm room or,
better still, in the sun. Turn them occasionally and leave for 2 - 3
days or until they turn black. For the spiced vinegar, crush the
spices lightly to bruise them, tie in a piece of cheesecloth and add
to the vinegar.  Boil in a covered enamel or stainless steel pan for
10 minutes.  Cool and remove the spices. Pack walnuts into dry jars,
then cover with spiced vinegar, seal at once and leave 7 - 8 weeks
before using.
