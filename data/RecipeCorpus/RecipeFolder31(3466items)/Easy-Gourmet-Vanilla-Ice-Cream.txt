Title: Easy Gourmet Vanilla Ice Cream
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 servings
1    Whole egg
2    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla extract; see note
2 c  Heavy cream; see note
Note: use only the best quality vanilla extract.

Beat the egg and egg yolks at high speed until light and fluffy,
about 2 minutes. Gradually add the sugar, beating until mixture
thickens. Lower the speed and mix in the milk and vanilla. Add the
cream manually. Chill, then pour into an ice-cream maker and freeze
according to manufacturer's instructions.

The original method is from Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert
Book, but I modified it to be easier.  I usually use 1 cup heavy
cream and 1 cup sour cream, and get good results.

It can be interesting to try with evaporated milk or low fat sour
cream or no fat plain yogurt or tofu or soy milk.
