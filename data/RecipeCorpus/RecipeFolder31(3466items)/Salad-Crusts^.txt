Cut whole wheat bread into very thin slices. Spread with butter,
mustard and a thin layer of grated cheese. Cover with another slice
of bread, cut into finger lengths. Brown in the oven and serve with
your salad.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
