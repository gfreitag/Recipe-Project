Cut the chicken into serving pieces. Turn them in the flour and shake
off the surplus. in a deep frying-pan melt half the butter. Add the
chicken pieces and, turning them frequently, brown them lightly. Add
the garlic, onion, vinegar, wine, tomato puree and seasonings. The
liquid must barely cover the chicken; if it does not, add a little
stock. Bring the mixture to the boil. Cover the pan, reduce the heat
and simmer, turning the pieces occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until
the chicken is cooked. Transfer the chicken pieces to a serving dish.
Skim the fat from the cooking liquid. If the flavour is weak,
increase the heat and boil the sauce to concentrate the flavour. Add
more tomato puree if necessary. Remove the pan from the heat and
whisk in the remaining butter and the mustard to taste. Strain the
sauce over the chicken pieces and serve.

The sauce in this dish is mildly piquant, very good and fresh tasting.
Courgettes go well with it. Blanch them in water and finish them in
butter over a low heat.
