Wash bird and cut into quarters or leave whole. Put in a roasting pan
or skillet. Add 1/2 cup water. Bake at 325F. for 1 1/2 hours. Plain
and simple and it turns out pretty good too. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
