Title: Quick Rising Oat Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 loaves
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Quaker Oats, uncooked
-- (quick or old-fashioned)
3 pk Active dry yeast
2 ts Salt
1 3/4 c  Water; plus...
1 tb Water
1/2 c  Aunt Jemima Syrup
-OR- Lite Syrup
1/2 c  Margarine or butter
4 c  All-purpose flour
-- (less may be needed)
Generously grease two 8x4 or 9x5-inch loaf pans.  In large mixer bowl,
combine whole wheat flour, oats, yeast and salt.  Heat 1-3/4 cups
water, syrups, and margarine until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F).
Pour over oats mixture; add 2 eggs.  Beat at low speed of electric
mixer 1 minute. Continue beating at medium speed 2 minutes.
Gradually stir in enough all-purpose flour to make a soft dough.  On
lightly floured surface, knead in enough remaining flour until dough
becomes smooth and elastic; about 10 minutes.  Place dough in large
greased bowl.  Cover; let rise in warm place about 45 minutes or
until double in size.

Punch dough down.  Divide into 2 parts; shape each into ball.  Allow
dough to rest, covered with inverted bowl, about 15 minutes.  Shape
each ball into loaf.  Place in prepared pans.  Cover; let rise in
warm place about 1/2 hour or until double in size.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Combine remaining egg and 1 tablespoon water;
brush over loaves.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until loaves sound
hollow when tapped lightly.  Immediately remove loaves from pans.
Cool on wire rack.
