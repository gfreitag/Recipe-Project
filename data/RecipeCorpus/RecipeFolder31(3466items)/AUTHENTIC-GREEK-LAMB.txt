Title: AUTHENTIC GREEK LAMB
Categories: Meats, Greek
Yield: 6 servings
1    Leg of lamb
Garlic clove; many
Oregano
Pepper
Lemon juice; lots
Salt
Place many cloves of garlic under the skin/into the meat all around
the leg.  Sprinkle lots of oregano, pepper, lots of lemon juice, and
a bit of salt on to the meat.  Cover with aluminum foil & bake.  The
meat should still be brown/pink when done (Approx 1.5 hrs).  I like
to uncover the last 1/2 hour to get a crust on the leg.
