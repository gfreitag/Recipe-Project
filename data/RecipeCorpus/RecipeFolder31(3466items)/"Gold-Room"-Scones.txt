Title: "Gold Room" Scones
Categories: Breads, Muffins
Yield: 20 scones
3 2/3 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Whole milk
3/4 c  Raisins
1/3 c  Honey
Preheat the oven to 425F. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder,
and salt in a large bowl. Mix well. Cut the butter into the flour
mixture with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse
cornmeal. Add the eggs, milk and raisings. Stir quickly with a fork
until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl and forms a ball. Spoon
onto an ungreased cookie sheet to form the desired number of scones.
Leave at least 1" between the scones. Bake until golden (about 12-15
minutes). Remove to a wire rack, and brush immediately with honey.
Serve at once with butter, jam and whipped cream.
