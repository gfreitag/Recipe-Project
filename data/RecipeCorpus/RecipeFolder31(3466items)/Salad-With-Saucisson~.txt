c  -- bite sized pieces

* Saucisson is a good hard salami, and a crusty baguette is the
perfect accompaniment.

Remove the "skin" or casing from the saucisson (or salami) and cut it
into about 20 very thin slices (about 5 per person). Wash the escarole
thoroughly, dipping it up and down in a sink filled with cold water,
and dry it in a salad spinner to remove moisture that would otherwise
dilute the vinaigrette.

For the Garlic-Dijon vinaigrette: In the bowl you will use for
serving the salad, mix together all the vinaigrette ingredients.  The
mixture should not be homogenized; the ingredients should separate
somewhat. At the serving time, add the escarole to the bowl and toss
it thoroughly with the vinaigrette.  Divide it among four plates and
arrange the 'saucisson' slices around the periphery of each plate.
Serve with crusty bread or baguettes.
