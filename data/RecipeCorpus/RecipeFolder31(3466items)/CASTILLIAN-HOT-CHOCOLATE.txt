Title: CASTILLIAN HOT CHOCOLATE
Categories: Beverages, Spanish, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Cocoa (powdered),
-unsweetened
1 c  Sugar
7 ts Cornstarch (cornflour)
1/2 c  Water
4 c  Milk
Mix the cocoa and sugar together.

Dissolve the cornstarch (cornflour) in the water and combine with the
cocoa-sugar mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.  Stir this until it
is a smooth paste.  Begin heating this mixture, continuously stirring
it with a whisk.  Gradually pour in the milk.  Continue stirring as
you bring it to a simmer.  Simmer, stirring often, for about 10
minutes.  The cocoa is ready when it thickens and is glossy and
smooth.

NOTES:

*  Thick, rich Spanish hot chocolate -- I first tasted this wonderful
beverage while touring in northern Spain with a choir. It's not like
any hot chocolate I've had anywhere else, and I was delighted to find
a recipe in "The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two." It is the best hot
chocolate in the world (at least to me.)

*  The consistency of the finished product should resemble chocolate
pudding that didn't quite set. If you halve this recipe, you'll get
just the right amount for two large mug-fulls. This cocoa is
especially fantastic when you dip churros into it (a churro is a
sugary, deep-fried, doughnut-like stick, and if anyone wants to send
out a recipe, I'd be most grateful).
