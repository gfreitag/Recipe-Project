Title: Richard's New Classic Potato Salad
Categories: Salads, Potatoes
Yield: 8 servings
2 lb Potatoes
1 c  Diced celery
1/2 c  Sliced scallion
-Richard's Classic Dressing
Scrub potatoes well and cut in bite-size pieces.  Most potatoes will
work well:  #1 chef, Idaho, Yukon Gold, redskin, white new, etc.,
although I generally save the redskins for a slightly different
treatment.

Boil potatoes gently for about 15 minutes till done al dente, then
drain and cool slightly under running cold water.

While still warm, mix with diced celery and scallions, then top with a
desired amount of Richard's New Classic Dressing -- some like it
drier, some like it wetter...

Adjust salt and pepper to taste, then refrigerate.  Serve chilled or
at room temperature.
Richard's New Classic Dressing: 1 cup mayo 1/3 cup Dijon mustard 1/4
cup sugar 1/4 cup rice (or other mild) vinegar Whisk all together till
well-mixed and sugar is dissolved. Use as a dressing for potato salad,
macaroni salad, cole slaw...
