1. In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over
medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour and let bubble without browning
for about 2 mins.

2. Whisk in the half-and-half and beer. Bring to a simmer over medium
heat. Reduce heat to low and cook until thickened, about 5 mins.

3. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add
the onion, chile pepper, and garlic and cook, stirring often, until
the onion is softened, about 3 mins. Add the tomatoes and cumin and
cook until the excess moisture is evaporated, about 3 mins. Stir the
vegetables into the sauce. (This sauce base can be made up to 1 day
ahead, cooled, covered, and refrigerated. Reheat over low heat.)

4. Gradually stir the cheeses into the sauce. Cook until the cheeses
are melted, but do not boil. Season with salt and hot sauce to taste.
Transfer to a serving bowl ( a small electric slow cooker or a thick
ceramic soup bowl works best to hold the heat) and serve warm, with
tortilla chips for dipping and cold beer. Makes 8 to 12 servings from
Clyde Nelson of The Home Ranch of Clark, Colo.
