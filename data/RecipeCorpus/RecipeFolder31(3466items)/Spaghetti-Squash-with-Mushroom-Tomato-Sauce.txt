Title: Spaghetti Squash with Mushroom Tomato Sauce
Categories: Vegetables, Low cal/fat, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 md Spaghetti squash
1 cn Tomato sauce
1 cn Mushrooms; including juice
1/2 ts Italian seasoning mix
1/4 ts Poultry seasoning mix
1/2 ts Hot pepper sauce; opt'l
An excellent vegetable side dish that's hardy enough to be a main
dish, perhaps with a little grated cheese for protein or served with
a bean dish. Serves 8 as a side dish or 4 as a main course depending
on the size of the squash.

In a saucepan combine the tomato sauce, canned mushrooms including
juice and the seasonings. Bring to a boil and gently simmer,
uncovered, until reduced by 1/4 and thickened.

Cut squash in half and clean out seeds and fibre. Reassemble and
micro wave on high for 10-12 min or until insides are cooked tender
and easily shredded by a fork. Cook another 2-4 min if necessary.
With a fork, scoop out the squash; the flesh should come out in long
strands that resemble spaghetti. [Use an oven mitt to hold the squash
halves as the skin will be quite hot.]

Serve the squash strands topped with the tomato sauce.
