* The original recipe called for dry mustard, but prepared mustard
works just as well. Mix all the ingredients for the dressing, adding
the vinegar at the last minute. Boil until thick and smooth. If
necessary, thin with pickle juice or milk. For a creamier dressing,
add mayonnaise or more mustard to taste. Pour over the potatoes while
they are still warm. Serves 10-12.
