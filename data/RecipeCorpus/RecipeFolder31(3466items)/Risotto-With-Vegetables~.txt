onion and saute' for 1 minute.  Add the rice, mix well, and stir in 2
1/2 cups of the stock.  Cook for 12 minutes, covered, over medium
heat, removing the lid two or three times to stir the rice, which
otherwise tends to stick to the bottom of the pan.  Then uncover the
pan and continue cooking the rice, stirring occasionally, until all
the stock has been absorbed. Add the fennel to the pan with another
1/2 cup of the stock and cook, covered, for 5 minutes, removing the

vegetables, stock, and salt, and cook, uncovered, another 5 minutes,
stirring, until the mixture is creamy and the rice is tender. Stir in
the cheese and serve immediately.
