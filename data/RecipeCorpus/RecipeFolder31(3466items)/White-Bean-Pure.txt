Title: White Bean Pure
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1 lb Dried white beans
-such as Great Northern
1 tb Olive oil
2 ts Garlic, minced
1 md Onion, peeled and diced
1    Carrot, peeled and diced
1 c  Chicken stock
Salt and pepper to taste
Grated nutmeg
1 pn Cayenne pepper
In a large saucepan, cover the beans with 10 cups of cold water and
bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and simmer the beans
for approximately 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until tender.

In a 12-inch saut pan, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add
the garlic, onion, and carrot and saut, stirring occasionally, for 5
minutes. Do not let the vegetables brown.

Add the cooked beans, chicken stock, and seasonings to the pan and
simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 5-10 minutes, until the
vegetables are soft and the beans are hot.

Place the bean mixture in the bowl of a food processor and pure it.
You may have to do this in two batches. Transfer the pure to a bowl,
taste and adjust seasonings. Serve in a bowl or casserole, or on a
platter.

Note: This keeps well in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Reheat either
in a saut pan on top of the stove over gentle heat with a little
stock or water, or place in a casserole, top with buttered crumbs if
desired, and heat in a 375F oven for at least 30 minutes.
