Title: New Orleans Red Gravy
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Cajun/creol
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Olive oil
1    Green bell pepper -- cored
-seeded -- diced (see cook's
-notes)
1    Whole head garlic -- peeled
-minced (see cook's notes)
1 lg Onion -- peeled & diced
1 cn (6 oz) tomato paste
1 cn (28 oz) whole tomatoes
1 c  Water
Bouquet garni (see cook's
-notes)
2    Lemons or limes, cut into
-6 or 8 pieces
pn Ground red (cayenne) pepper
Salt, to taste
1/4 ts Ground allspice (optional)
Cook's notes: You can use any color of bell pepper you prefer and
reduce the amount of garlic.

For bouquet garni, tie together with string a 5-inch sprig of fresh
rosemary, a 5-inch sprig of fresh thyme, 3 large fresh bay leaves, two
5-inch sprigs of fresh Greek oregano. When cooked, the leaves from
all the herbs, except the bay leaves, probably will be off the stems.
If desired, add ground allspice to sauce.

Procedure: Heat a large pot or Dutch oven (one that has a tight
fitting lid - cast iron preferred) on medium-high heat. Add oil, and
heat oil until hot.

Heating the oil first will prevent the vegetables from sticking. Add
bell pepper and cook 3 minutes. Add onion and garlic and cook until
onion is transparent.

Stir in tomato paste. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes,
stirring frequently. Watch carefully because mixture can burn easily.
This

procedure will take the bitterness out of the tomato paste. Add 1 can
whole tomatoes and 1 cup water. Break up tomatoes with end of spoon
or spatula. Add bouquet garni, lemons or limes and a small pinch of
ground red pepper; cover and cook on medium to medium-low heat for 1
hour. Add salt to taste.

Discard bouquet garni.

Presentation: Use to top fish or on pasta, rice or potatoes.

Yield: Makes 6 to 8 cups.
