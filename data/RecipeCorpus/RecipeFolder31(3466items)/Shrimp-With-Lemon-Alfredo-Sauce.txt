Title: Shrimp With Lemon Alfredo Sauce
Categories: Fish, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 lb Tiger shrimp -- raw
1 lg Lemon
8 oz Fettucine
2 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Half and half -- OR
Light cream
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese -- grated
Salt and pepper
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Peel and devein the
shrimp, rinse in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Grate
enough zest (yellow part only) from the lemon to measure 1 teaspoon,
then squeeze the juice from the lemon; set the zest and juice aside.
When the water comes to a rolling boil, add the fettuccine and simmer
just until al dente (tender, but still firm), 2-3 minutes for fresh
pasta. 5-7 minutes for dried. While the pasta is cooking, combine the
butter and cream in a medium skillet (preferably non-stick, bring to
a boil and boil for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in
the lemon zest, lemon juice and shrimp and simmer until the shrimp
are opaque through, 3-5 minutes; the shrimp will be evenly pink and
partly curled.

Drain the pasta thoroughly and put it in a large bowl.  Pour the hot
shrimp sauce over, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and
stir quickly and thoroughly to coat the noodles with sauce.  Transfer
the hot pasta to individual plates, distributing the shrimp evenly.
Serve immediately, passing extra grated Parmesan cheese alongside.
