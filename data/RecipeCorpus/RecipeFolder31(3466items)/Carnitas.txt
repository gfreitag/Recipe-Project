Title: Carnitas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Boneless pork ribs
2    Strips  Lime peel
2 1/2 lb Lard
1/4 c  Water
Place the lard and water in a deep heavy pan (a dutch oven or one of
your deep cast iron pots would be perfect.)  Heat over medium heat
until the lard is melted.  Add the lime peel and meat (one cook I
knew marinated the meat in half orange juice, half beer before
cooking -- made a nice flavor).

Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer the pork in the lard until
cooked through, but not browned, about 1 hour).  Increase the heat to
medium high, and cook another 15-20 minutes or so, until the meat is
well browned and crispy on the outside.

Drain meat, and serve with tortillas, guacamole, homemade pico de
gallo, sprigs of fresh cilantro, lime wedges, sliced onion, whatever
other condiments appeal to you.

The lard can be cooled, strained, and poured into a container.  It
will keep indefinitely under refrigeration, and may be reused 3-4
times.

When cooked this way, the lard seems to render all of the fat out of
the pork, leaving crispy bits of meat that taste like the good, crisp
exterior of a pork roast.  The inside is tender, juicy, and delicious.

In Mexico, they do this in BIG outdoor kettles, and cook most
portions of the pig.  The result is used for taco fillings, tortas
(Mexican- style Po-Boys), and various other dishes.  I've seen
versions of the dish that call for cooking the meat very slowly in an
oven (probably developed by someone who was horrified at the amount
of lard used in the dish), but IMHO, these variations seem to
actually be greasier and fattier than the old-fashioned method of
frying the pork in lard.
