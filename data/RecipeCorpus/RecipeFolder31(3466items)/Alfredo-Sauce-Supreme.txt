Title: Alfredo Sauce Supreme
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1    To 2 tbls
2    To 3 closves  garlic --
-pressed
1    8 oz pkg Cream cheese, cut
-up
2/3    To 3/4 cup Fresh Parmesan
-cheese, grated
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Cream, (whipping OR half 'n
-half)
1/8 c  Milk -- optional
Olive oil
In a large sauce pan lightly cook the garlic (DO NOT BROWN) .  Add the
cheeses, butter, cream and milk, whisking constantly until smooth.
If the suace is too thick, you may want to add a little milk. Toss
fettucini lightly with sauce, coating well. This recipe is easily
doubled, tripled, or whatever for large crowds and any  leftover
sauce freezes well. This recipe is enough sauce for about 1/2 to 3/4
pound (before cooking) of fettuccine and will serve 3 or 4 as a side
dish.
