5-inch pancakes

Combine whole-wheat flour, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda,
salt and cinnamon in large bowl.  Add eggs, 3 T oil, honey, apples
and 1 1/2 cups water, mixing thoroughly.  Batter should be runny, the
consistency of warm honey.  Add additional water if necessary.

Place griddle or skillet over medium heat.  When water dropped onto
surface sizzles, brush surface with oil.  Using 1/4 cup batter for
each pancake, pour onto surface far enough apart so pancakes do not
touch. Brown pancakes on 1 side.  When bubbles appear on uncooked
surface, turn pancakes and brown on second side.  Serve topped with
yogurt and applesauce. Submitted By ROBERT MILES   On   06-13-95
