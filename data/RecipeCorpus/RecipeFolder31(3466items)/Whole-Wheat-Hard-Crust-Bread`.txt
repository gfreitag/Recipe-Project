Title: Whole-Wheat Hard-Crust Bread`
Categories: Breads, Tasteofhome
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Active Dry Yeast
4 1/2 c  Warm Water
4 1/2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 tb Salt
7 tb Cooking Oil
10 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 c  Whole-Wheat Flour
Sesame Seeds
Proof the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water and 1 tsp sugar. Mix the rest
of the sugar, the salt, and 6 Tbs of the oil with the rest of the
warm water. Make a well in the center of the flour; put all the
liquid and yeast in the well, and mix all together. Keep pulling the
flour until everything is mixed. Then start kneading by hand, adding
a little more flour if needed, so that the dough leaves the hands.
Let sit in a greased mixing bowl for 10 mins; then remove and knead
for 1-2 mins. Do this 4 more times, every 10 mins. Alternatively, let
rise once until doubled in bulk and punch down.

Place in 4 oblong or round greased baking tins, or mold on a cookie
sheet sprinkled with oil. Cut the top with a knife and let rise 1 1/2
hrs. Sprinkle with oil and then sesame seeds.

Bake in a 400 F oven 20 mins, or until golden. Makes 4 loaves.
