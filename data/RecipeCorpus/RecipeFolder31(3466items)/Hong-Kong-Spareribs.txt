4 tb Dark soy sauce
1 ts Cornstarch

1. Look for the meatiest ribs and have them cut with a meat saw, first
crosswise into 1" pieces, and then into individual ribs.

2. Heat 1 tbs oil in a wok over high heat, add ginger, scallions, and
garlic. Stir-fry until golden, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer ti a bowl
and combine with rice wine, cider vinegar, five-spice powder, honey,
soy sauce, and 6 tbs water.

3. Combine spareribs and sauce in a shallow dish, cover and marinate
for 2 hours. Make sure that the sauce covers the meat completely, or
turn the meat often.

4. Preheat oven to 350F. Heat remaining 1 tbs oil in wok over high
heat. Remove spareribs from marinade and brown in oil, about 3-4
minutes. Cook in batches, transferring browned ribs to a heavy
covered pot. When all the meat is browned, pour off fat. Stir
cornstarch into marinade until dissolved. Pour marinade into wok, and
stir to combine with any pan juices. Cook over medium heat until
slightly thickened. Pour over meat. Cook in oven for 1 hours or until
meat is tender, falling off the bone, and coated with a rich glaze.

5. Remove spareribs from pot and skim any fat from the sauce. Return
spareribs to pot, add scallions and red bell peppers for garnish, and
serve.
