Categories: Cake/cookie

2    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Flour
1/8 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder

1/2 c  Hot milk
MMMMM---------------------BAKED-ON FROSTING--------------------------
1    Egg white
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Chopped nuts
Preheat oven to 350~. Sift dry ingredients. Melt butter in hot milk.
Beat eggs until light and thick. Slowly add sugar; beat with a spoon
5 minutes, or with electric mixer for 2 1/2 minutes.

Working quickly, fold sifted dry ingredients into egg-and-sugar
mixture all at once. Then, all at once, add hot milk in which butter
has been melted. The folding in of the dry ingredients and milk
should take only 1 minute. Bake in greased and flour-dusted 8-inch
square pan for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, leaving oven on.

Beat egg white with 1/4 teaspoon baking powder. Gradually beat in
brown sugar; spread over hot cake. Sprinkle with chopped nuts. Bake
in oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
