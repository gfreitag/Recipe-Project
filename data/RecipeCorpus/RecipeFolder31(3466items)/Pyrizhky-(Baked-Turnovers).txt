Title: Pyrizhky (Baked Turnovers)
Categories: Desserts, Holiday, Russian
Yield: 10 servings
2 1/2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1/4 lb Butter; 1 Stick
1/2 c  Sour Cream
3 lg Egg Yolks
1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg White; Beaten With A
-Little Water For Glazing
1/2 c  Coarse Sugar Crystals;
-(Optional)
Combine the flour and cold butter in a processor or cut the butter
with a pastry cutter into coarse crumbs.  Add the egg yolks, salt,
and cream and process or knead lightly until the dough forms a ball.
Cut in half, wrapping each have in plastic wrap, refigerate for at
least 2 hours or overnight.  Roll out half the dough on a lightly
floured work surface, to about 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut into rounds
with a 3-inch cutter or wine glass.  Place a spoonful of the filling
on one side of each round, fold the top over, brush with a little of
the egg glaze and seal with a fork or pastry cutter for a fancy edge.
Place each turnover on a lightly greased or non-stick baking sheet
and brush with the glaze then sprinkle with the sugar crystals.  Bake
in a preheated 375 Degree F. oven for about 20 minutes.  Cool on wire
racks.

NOTE:

This is a short dough so a non-stick baking sheet would be the best.
If it is not available, brush as little grease on the sheet as
possible using a pastry brush or new paint brush.
