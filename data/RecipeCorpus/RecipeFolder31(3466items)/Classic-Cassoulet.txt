This is a classic dish from Southwestern France which is famous for
its Pate de foie Gras. This is how they use the rest of the goose!
Every French housewife has her own combinations of meats.

Dry rub the roast with the seasonings and let marinade overnight.
Roast it and set aside to cool reserving the meat juices.

Meanwhile soak the beans overnight and then drain, rinse and re-cover
with water. With a sharp knife or shears cut the pork rind into 1/4"
wide strips and then into tiny triangles. In a saucepan, cover the
rind bits with water and simmer 30 min to freshen the rind. Add the
rind and the bacon to the beans and bring to a simmer. Skim off the
scum and cook about 1 1/2 hrs [or more until the beans are tender]
adding water if necessary to keep the beans covered at all times.
During the last half hour add the onions, garlic, parsley, cloves,
thyme and bay leaves. Let the beans sit in the cooking fluid until
ready to assemble the casserole.

As the beans cook and pork is roasting, cut the mutton into 2 "
chunks. Pour the goose fat into a casserole and heat until almost
smoking. Brown the meat. Set aside. Brown the bones and add them to
the meat. Lower the heat and cook the onions. Return the meat and
bones to the casserole and add the garlic, tomato paste, thyme, bay
leaves, wine and stock. Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hrs. Discard the bones
and bay leaves.

Drain the beans and discard the bay leaves, reserving the cooking
fluids. Add the beans to the mutton and roast pork juices. Add just
enough bean juice to cover and simmer 5 min. Drain the beans again.

Cut the roast pork into chunks. Slice the bacon. Alternate layers of
the beans, mutton, pork and bacon in the casserole and cover with the
pork and mutton juices. Add a little bean juice if necessary , so
that the beans are covered. Spread on the crumbs and parsley and
dribble on the fat. Bake at 375 until the top crusts and reduce to
350. Break the crust periodically and baste it with the casserole
juices. Add more bean juice if it starts to dry out. Bake one more
hour and serve.

As this is very hardy the rest of the meal should be light; perhaps a
clear soup to start and a green salad with the casserole. Choose a
rose, strong white or a young red wine to accompany. Fresh fruit
would be sufficient for dessert.
