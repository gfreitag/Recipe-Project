Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts, Healthy
Yield: 36 servings
2    Egg whites
1/3 c  Margarine or butter
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Sugar
2    Egg yolks

This recipe is a rendition of the Classic Austrian dessert, Linzer
torte, popular for its almond crust and raspberry preserves filling.

In medium mixing bowl bring egg whites to room temperature. Set aside.

For crust:  In another medium mixing bowl beat margarine or butter
with an electric mixer on medium to high speed about 30 seconds or
till softened. Add about half the flour. Then add the sugar and egg
yolks. Beat on medium to high speed till thoroughly combined,
scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Stir in the remaining flour.
Press crust mixture into an ungreased 9x9x2-inch baking pan. Bake in
a 350~ oven for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, thoroughly wash and dry the beaters. For meringue topping,
add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat on medium speed till soft
peaks form (tips curl). Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating
till stiff peaks form (tip stands straight). Gently fold in the
chopped nuts. Set meringue topping aside.

Spread preserves over the top of the hot baked crust. Then carefully
spread meringue topping over the preserves layer. Bake in the 350~
oven about 20 minutes more or till top is golden. Cool in pan on a
wire rack. Cut into squares. Store in refrigerator. Makes 36.
