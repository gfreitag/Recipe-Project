Title: Barley Pilaf
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Butter
2 tb Onion(s), chopped
2 c  Uncooked pearl barley
2 c  Chicken stock
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Bay leaf
In a heavy-bottomed 1-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low
heat. Add the onion and sweat for a few minutes, until it is softened
but not brown.

Add the barley and stir well to coat each grain with butter. Cook for
a minute or two until the barley starts to turn opaque. Add the
stock, salt, pepper, and bay leaf and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer very gently for 35-40
minutes, until all the stock is absorbed. Taste; adjust the
seasonings, remove the bay leaf, and fluff with a fork before serving.
