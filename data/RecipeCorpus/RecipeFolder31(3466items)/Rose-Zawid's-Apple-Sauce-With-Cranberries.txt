Rose Zawid, a Holocaust survivor who runs a boardinghouse in Atlantic
City, N.J., makes an applesauce with cranberries that is a good
complement to latkes served with meat. The cranberries add flavor and
make the applesauce turn slightly rosy.

Place cranberries, water, sugar and apples in saucepan. Cover and
simmer until apples are soft, 20 minutes. Cool slightly. Press
mixture through food mill. Adjust sugar to taste and serve. Makes
about 8 cups.
