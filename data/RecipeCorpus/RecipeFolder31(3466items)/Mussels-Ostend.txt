Belgium is one of the greatest beer-drinking countries in the world.
This tiny nation produces some 130 beers. The Belgians are also
intrepid mussel eaters, and their boats haul in an export mussel crop
second to none. To combine these two Belgian passions, what better
recipe than this one, which cooks the mussels in root vegetables and
beer?

Cut the peeled carrot and turnip into neat 5 mm cubes. In a large
saucepan or wide pan with a lid, heat the butter and saute the carrot
and turnip without browning until well greased and shiny, then add
the onion and turn a few seconds. Add the beer, bring to the boil,
reduce heat and simmer until the root vegetables are softened and the
beer is reduced to nothing and has slightly caramelised on the base
of the pan. Now add the scrubbed mussels, pepper them, cover, raise
the heat again and steam the mussels until they open, shaking the pot
or turning the top mussels to the bottom at least once.

As soon as the mussels open, throw in the parsley, stir two or three
times and serve immediately in wide soup bowls. Add a ladle of
vegetables and juice to the base of the bowl. Pepper as with moules
marinieres, do not expect everybody to eat all the soup. Serves 6
