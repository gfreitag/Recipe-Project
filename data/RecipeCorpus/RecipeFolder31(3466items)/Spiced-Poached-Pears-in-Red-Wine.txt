Title: Spiced Poached Pears in Red Wine
Categories: Side dish, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Full-bodied red wine
4    Whole cloves
1    Cinnamon stick
4    Whole allspice
Grated nutmeg
10    Whole black peppercorns
2    Bay leaves
2    Ripe pears
Combine red wine and spices in a deep, nonreactive pan. If you use a
shallow saucepan, you'll need more wine to keep the pears submerged.

Peel the pears and cut them in half lengthwise. Core them and place
them in the pan with the wine. Bring to a boil and simmer for about
35 minutes. When done (test by piercing a pear with a toothpick  it
should go in easily), gently remove pears from liquid.

Serve hot, cold or at room temperature. If not serving immediately,
let the poaching liquid cool and cover the pears with it.
