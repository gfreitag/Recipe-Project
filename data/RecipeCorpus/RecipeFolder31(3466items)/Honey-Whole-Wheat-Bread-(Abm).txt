Title: Honey Whole Wheat Bread (Abm)
Categories: Breadmaker, Fatfree, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
4 c  Whole wheat bread flour
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Honey
2 1/2 ts Yeast
4 tb Gluten
1/2 ts Salt
1    Handful toasted wheat germ
(opt)
*optional - at the mix-in beep [or near the end of kneading if you
don't have one] we add in a big handful of honey toasted wheat germ -
don't worry about the amount but do watch the moisture of the dough
ball - it blends right in and makes it really hearty - and healthy!

Toss it all in the bread maker and enjoy! - You can throw in dried
fruit later if you like [but not too much!] but we like the wheat
germ. The bread is super for breakfast, and the sweetness goes with
most sandwiches too!
