Categories: Breads, Cowboy
Yield: 16 servings
Recipe For Sourdough Bread
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Packed Light Brown Sugar
1/2 c  Raisins
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
3 tb Butter -- melted
1/2 c  Orange Juice
1. Make the sourdough bread dough through step 4.

2. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a 12 by
16-in rectangle. In a medium bowl, combine the sugars, raisins, and
cinnamon. Brush the dough with the melted butter, leaving a 1-in
border all around, then spread with the raisin mixture. Starting at a
long side, roll up tightly in to a cylinder, and pinch the seam to
seal. Using a sharp knife, cut crosswise into 16 slices about 1 inch
thick.

3. Butter well a 13 by 9-in baking pan. Arrange the slices in the pan
and cover with plastic wrap. Let the rolls rise in a warm place until
doubled in volume, about 1 hr.

4. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Pour the orange juice over the rolls.
Bake until the rolls are golden brown, 25 to 30 mins. Invert the roll
onto a serving platter and serve warm.

Note: The rolls can also be prepared in a 16-inch Dutch oven and
baked for about 25 mins according to instructions for Dutch oven
cooking.

Makes 16 rolls from Tim Christian of Figure 3 Ranch of Claude, TX.
