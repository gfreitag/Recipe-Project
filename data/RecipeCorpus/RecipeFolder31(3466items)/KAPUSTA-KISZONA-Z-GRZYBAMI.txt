Title: KAPUSTA KISZONA Z GRZYBAMI
Categories: Polish, Holiday, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1 oz Mushrooms, dried
-(or use about
-1/4 lb fresh mushrooms)
1/2 c  Warm water
1 lg Onion
2 1/2 ts Butter
1 1/2 lb Sauerkraut, rinsed
-and drained
1/3 c  Water
2 tb Flour
Salt and pepper
Soak the dried mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water for 1 hour.  Saute
mushrooms and onion in butter in a skillet 3 minutes. Add sauerkraut
to mushrooms; cook and stir for 10 minutes.

Blend 1/3 cup water into flour.  Mix with sauerkraut and simmer for 15
minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

NOTES:

*  Stewed Sauerkraut with Mushrooms -- This recipe could be used as
part of a 12-course meal known in Polish as Wigilia, or on its own.
Wigilia is eaten after sundown on Christmas Eve. This tastes better
if you make your own sauerkraut (but that's another recipe).

*  I usually like to add 1/4 cup of dark rum after cooking.  That
reminds me of the recipe I have for bigos (similar in construction
but with more ingredients).

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  1 hour.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
