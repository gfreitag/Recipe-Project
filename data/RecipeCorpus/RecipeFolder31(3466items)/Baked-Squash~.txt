Title: Baked Squash~
Categories: Vegetables, Healthy
Yield: 2 servings
2    Squash, crookneck -- summer
Or zucchini
Liquid margarine
Brown sugar
You can use either type of squash but the yellow type tastes the best.
(I've also done this with acorn squash, but you have to slice it
before you can peel it.) I use one squash per person--yields 4 slices
per person.

Peel squash. Slice lengthwise, then in half. Place slices in baking
dish, cut side up. Dot generously with margarine. Sprinkle brown
sugar on each slice.

Bake in 350~ oven for 30-40 minutes or until done. You may sprinkle
on more brown sugar during last 10 minutes of baking, if desired.
