Categories: Healthy, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
1 pt Blueberries
1 pt Blackberries
1 pt Strawberries
1 sm Container raspberries --
(about 1/2 cup)
1/2 c  Frozen apple-juice
Concentrate
1 c  Water
1/4 c  Maple syrup
1 tb Potato or cornstarch
1/4 ts Cinnamon
Mint leaves (for garnish)
Prep time:  15 mins.    Chilling time:  1 hour

Clean all berries separately. Pick over and discard inferior berries.
Hull strawberries, cutting the larger ones in half. Set all berries
aside in separate bowls. Combine apple-juice concentrate, water and
maple syrup in a medium saucepan. Place potato or cornstarch in a
small bowl and stir in 1/4 cup of the apple-juice mixture. Then add
starch back to pan. Add blueberries and cinnamon and bring to a
simmer (mixture will be cloudy at first) until mixture turns clear
and transparent. Carefully stir in blackberries and strawberries and
remove from heat. Refrigerate and let cool completely. Gently stir in
raspberries. Serve in goblets or large wine glasses and garnish each
portion with a sprig of mint. Serves 6.

NOTE:  Commonly known as kissili, this dessert is an easy, versatile
treat. Basically, you need four pints of mixed berries, but all
combinations are acceptable. Some of the more exotic varieties grown
in the Scandinavian countries--gooseberries, rowenberries, pale
orange cloudberries, lingonberries, arctic raspberries--adapt easily
for kissili. A simple wheat biscuit or shortbread is traditionally
served alongside.
