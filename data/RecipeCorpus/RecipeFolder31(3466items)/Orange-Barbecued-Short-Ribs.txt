Categories: Meats, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Soy sauce

Juice 1 orange
2 tb Grated orange zest
2 tb Ginger root -- minced

Combine soy sauce, ketchup, sugar, orange juice, orange zest, ginger
and garlic in bowl. Set aside.

Season ribs to taste with salt and pepper. Dredge ribs in flour and
shake off excess. Put oil in skillet, heat to smoking and fry ribs
until brown.

Arrange browned ribs in single layer in rectangular baking dish. Pour
reserved sauce over. Cover and bake ribs at 350 degrees 1 1/2 to 2
hours or until ribs are fork tender. Baste ribs occasionally with
sauce.

Remove ribs from sauce. Skim excess fat off sauce.

Serve ribs with sauce. Garnish with green onion curls.

NOTE: To make green onion curls: Cut onions into 3- to 4-inch lengths,
keeping only the white parts. Trim root ends. Lay on cutting board
and make 1-inch lengthwise slices around the onion. Repeat for the
opposite end. Soak onions in cold water 1 to 2 hours before serving.
Onion ends will open into "blossoms."

These ribs are even better the day after you make them - but they're
terrific right out of the oven, too.
