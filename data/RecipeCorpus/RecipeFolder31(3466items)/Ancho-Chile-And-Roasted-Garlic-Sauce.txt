Title: Ancho Chile And Roasted Garlic Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
1    Head of garlic
1    Garlic clove
3/4 c  Oil plus 2T oil
1 1/2 oz Dried ancho chiles
1/2 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Balsamic vinegar + 2t
1 tb Brown sugar + 1t
1 1/2 ts Cumin
1 1/2 ts Coarse salt
1/2 ts White pepper
pn Ground cloves
Cut off the top quarter of the head of garlic to expose the cloves,
arrange the head in the center of a large piece of foil, and drizzle
it with 2 tsps of the oil. Enclose the garlic completely, double
folding the edges of the foil, and roast it in the middle of a
preheated 425 degree oven for 25-35 minutes, or until the cloves are
tender. While the garlic is roasting, toast the chilies on a piece of
foil in the middle of the 425 degree oven for 1 minute, or until they
are pliable (be careful not to let them burn). Wearing rubber gloves,
pull the stems off the chilies, halve the chilies, and shake out the
seeds. In a small saucepan combine the chilies with water to cover
and simmer them, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the
heat and let the chilies stand for 10 mins. Drain the chilies and
plunge them into a bowl of ice and cold water to loosen the skins.
Drain the chilies and on a work surface, scrape the flesh carefully
from the skins to obtain 1/4 cup flesh. Remove the roasted garlic
cloves from the husks and in a blender blend them with the raw garlic
clove, the chili flesh, the remaining 3/4 cup of oil, the broth, the
vinegar, the brown sugar, the cumin, the salt, the white pepper and
the ground cloves until the sauce is smooth. Serve the sauce at room
temperature with grilled chicken, meats, or vegetables or with a taco
salad.
