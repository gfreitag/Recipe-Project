Title: HIPPO POT DE MOUSSE
Categories: Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
4 oz Semisweet chocolate
2 oz Bittersweet chocolate
2 c  Heavy cream,
-well-chilled (whipping
-cream will do nicely)
1 ts Almond extract
-(optional)
Melt the chocolate together in the top of a double boiler.  Be
careful to do this slowly, so as not to burn the chocolate, and to
keep all moisture away from the pot. Let the chocolate cool for five
minutes.

While the chocolate cools, whip the cream and almond extract together
until very stiff.  Gently fold the cooled chocolate into the whipped
cream. There will be many flecks of chocolate in the mixture.

If you're not going to eat it all yourself, spoon into six large wine
glasses. Chill one hour.

NOTES:

*  Extremely quick and easy chocolate mousse -- This is an adaptation
of a very easy chocolate mousse recipe from Sandra Boynton's
hilarious book, "Chocolate, the Consuming Passion."  It requires none
of the laborious preparation that most French mousse recipes call
for, and really optimizes the effort needed to consume the chocolate,
which is, after all, what this is all about. Yield: Serves one to six
people.

*  If you're careful, you can also melt the chocolate in a microwave
oven, in its wrapper. If you try this, be especially mindful of the
semisweet chocolate, as the sugar therein caramelizes very quickly,
leading to an awful mess (and ruined chocolate).

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
