This spicy drink is generally served hot, possibly with milk and/or
sweetening, sometimes with a splash of a warming liquor.  It is
brewed from the bark of a native tree.  The flavor is something like
a cinnamony chocolate, with a touch of hazelnut and coffee.  It can
be drunk cold, but the preferred taste is warm.  Klah contains a mild
stimulant like caffeine and is used as a morning drink.
