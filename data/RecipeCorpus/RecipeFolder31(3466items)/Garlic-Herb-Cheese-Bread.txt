NOTES : Recommend using sharp cheddar cheese.

Keep an eye on the dough and adjust as necessary because of the
cheese. The cheese should be lightly packed in the measuring cup. The
garlic and herbs may be adjusted to taste. Scrape the sides of the
pan with a rubber spatula if the ingredients are not mixing.
