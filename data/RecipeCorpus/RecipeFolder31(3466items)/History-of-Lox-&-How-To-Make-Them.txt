1 ea Qty VERY fresh & fatty,
-whole salmon
1 ea Lrg earthenware crock (or
-wooden keg)
Kosher Salts (or rock salt)
1 ea Qty Clear flavorless oil
Comparable to the
Qty of salmon
~ Skin the salmon keeping the skin as whole as possible. - Cut the
salmon meat into thin slices. - Within the crock, (or keg), lay down
a layer of salt to cover evenly. - Place one side of the salmon skin
scale side up flat onto the salt layer. - Drizzle the oil lightly
over the skin until shiny. - Lay one salmon slice atop the oiled
skin. - Drissle the oil lightly over the salmon slice until shiny. -
Layer the salts thinly atop the salmon slice to cover. - Repeat the
layers as above alternating salt, salmon, oil for all remaining
slices. - Before adding the final layer of salts, lay the other side
of the skin scale side up atop the oiled salmon. - Drissle with oil
until shiny. - Layer salts atop the final layer of skin to cover. -
Cover entire crock (or keg) with multiple layers (3-4) of plastic
wrap - Weigh down the top of the sealed crock (or keg) with heavy
stones. - Store in a cool place 2 weeks prior to usage. - Eat when
ready!~ NOTE: This will keep almost indefinitely, however,
refrigeration is recommended. NOTE: For some additional flavor,
smoking is optional. Lox comes from the German word "lachs," which
means salmon, and came here with German-Jewish immigrants.  Note that
true lox is not smoked, merely brined, although the smoked salmon
called Nova is often incorrectly referred to as lox.  The name Nova
comes from Nova Scotia, which is where that type of cold-smoked
salmon first came from. Old-fashioned Jewish lox is saltier and
oilier than Nova. It comes from a Jewish friend of mine in Long
Island taken from her grandmother's (Isabella Bouer) recipe.Also, she
wishes to ask you to please enjoy this, her grandmother would want it
that way... I hope this helps you out. Posted in rec.food.history
