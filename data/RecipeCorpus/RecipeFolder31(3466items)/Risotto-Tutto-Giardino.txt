Title: Risotto Tutto Giardino
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Olive Oil
5    Shallots, chopped
3    Cloves Garlic, chopped
1 1/3 c  Arborio Rice
4 c  Vegetable Broth
Broccoli Florets
1    Zucchini, chunked
1/2    Red Bell Pepper, cubed
1/4 c  Peas or Corn
6    Spears Asparagus, cut up
1/4 c  Parmesean Cheese, grated
2 tb Basil, chopped
Heat Olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add shallots and
garlic and saute until softened, then stir in rice. Stir in wine and
1 cup of the hot broth. Cook over meduim-high heat, stirring, until
liquid is almost absorbed, then pour in another cup of stock and
continue cooking and stirring. The grains will swell, the liquid will
become creamy and the rice will be cooking it's way to al dente.
Continue stirring and adding broth.

When rice is nearly cooked, about 20 minutes, begin adding vegetables,
starting with those that take the longest to cook, and ending with
those that take but a moment.

Sir in half the Parmesean, then serve immediately, sprinkled with the
remaining Parmesean and the basil.
