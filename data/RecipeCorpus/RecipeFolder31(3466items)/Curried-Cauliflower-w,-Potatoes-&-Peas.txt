1    Onion; chopped
1 ts Olive oil
1 cl Garlic; minced
1 tb Ginger root; grated
1 lb Cauliflower; ( 3 cups)
12 oz Potatoes
1/2 ts Coriander

1/2 c  Tomato puree; no salt added
1 c  Peas
1/8 ts Salt
Black pepper to taste
Chop the whole onion  (about 1 cup).

Heat a non-stick pan, large enough to hold all the ingredients over
high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium high; add the oil, and stir in
the onion.

Saute' the onion until it begins to brown and soften.

Meanwhile, mince the garlic and grate the ginger, and add to the
onion as it cooks.

Trim the whole cauliflower, and cut the head into bite-size pieces.
Scrub the potatoes, and cut into julienne strips.

Stir the coriander, fennel, cumin, turmeric and hot red pepper into
the onion mixture, and cook for 30 seconds.

Add the cauliflower, potatoes, water and tomato puree.  Reduce the
heat to a simmer; cover, and continue to cook until the vegetables
are tender, about 5 minutes.

A minute before the cauliflower and potatoes are done, stir in the
peas, salt and pepper.  Cover, and cook another minute or so.
