Cooking teacher Jan Main, whose book of recipes for those with lactose
intolerance will be published by McMillan in early 1996, shares this
nutrition-packed, tasty, main-dish salad. Main, who promises plenty of
reipes based on tofu in her book ("It's a great low-fat source of
protein and calcium") likes the silken tofu made by Mori-Nu and sold
in Tetra-Paks at most health food stores and uses the firm kind for
this recipe. A fan of peas, Main likes to stir them into basmati
rice, to go with fish, or pureed in a sauce or soup. She also points
out that , although fresh-from-the=field peas are great, "Peas are
the best frozen vegetable you can butbecause they are picked and then
flash-frozen at their peak. "When using frozen peas, she pours
boiling water over them and lets them sit for a few minutes before
using them.

In a small bowl, whisk together oil, lemon juice, honey, soy sauce,
ginger, garlic, salt and pepper. In large saucepan of boiling, salted
water, cook asparagus, peas and carrots, incovered, about 2 minutes
or just until tender. Drain and refresh under cold water. In serving
bowl, combine pea mixture, red pepper and tofu. Pour dressing over
top and toss to coat. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Makes about 6
servings.
