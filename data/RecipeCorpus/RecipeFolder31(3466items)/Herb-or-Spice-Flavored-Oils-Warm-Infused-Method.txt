Title: Herb or Spice Flavored Oils-Warm Infused Method
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 cup
1/2 c  Finely chopped fresh
-rosemary, sage
-oregano or lavender
OR
3/4 c  Ground cumin, cinnamon
-nutmeg, ginger, star anise
-saffron, black pepper
-or curry powder
-(about 2 ounces)
OR
1/4 c  Chopped fresh ginger
1 c  Olive oil
Put herbs or spices and oil in a heavy saucepan. Heat over high heat
until the mixture begins to sizzle gently. Let cook, for about 10
seconds, remove pan from heat, and swirl contents until sizzling
stops. Pour through a fine strainer or coffee filters into a
sterilized jar or bottle. Press down on herbs to release the last bit
of oil and flavor. Seal tightly, refrigerate, and use within 1 week
for best flavor.

Note: Use this method for tough-leafed herbs such as rosemary and
sage as well as dried spices. Use the amounts of flavoring
ingredients as a guide, feeling free to add more or less depending on
the quality of your ingredients and your taste preferences. Dried
spices extract very well and make delicious oils. For the best
flavor, grind your own spices from the whole spice. The amount given
will make a strongly flavored oil; dilute with more olive oil if
desired.
