Title: Olivado & Sweet Basil Pesto
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Side dish, Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 recipe
7 oz Kalamata olives, pitted &
-- halved
3 oz Fresh sweet basil leaves
1 ea Garlic clove, chopped
1/3 c  Olive oil
In a food processor or by hand, coarsely chop the olives & the basil.
Combine with the garlic & olive oil until you have a chunky,
relishy-like consistency.  Use up quite quickly as the basil will
lose texture rapidly.

VARIATION: Olive & Fresh Rosemary Pesto: In place of the basil, use
1-2 oz rosemary, chopped.  Serve as you would any pesto.
