Title: Uncle John's Navy Hash^
Categories: Meats, Vegetables, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
Cold baked potatoes
Cold pot roast or whatever
Meat you have
Assorted leftover
Vegetables; carrots, cabbage
Celery
1    Onion, chopped
2    Eggs, beaten
Soda crackers, crushed
This is a real good way to use up leftovers and it tastes great too.
Cut potatoes, meat and vegetables into pieces. Fry meat and onion
together until onion is cooked. Add potatoes and vegetables and fry
until hot. Stir in beaten eggs to bind all together. Add crushed
crackers. You might want to serve this with some ketchup, but it's
good and filling all by itself. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
