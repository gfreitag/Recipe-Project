Title: Cliff's Pizza Topping
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Bell pepper, green, chopped
1 lg Bell pepper, red, chopped
1 md Onion, chopped
1 lg Tomato, sliced into rounds
1 c  Mozzarella cheese, shredded
(Use more or less to taste)
Sprinkle cheese on rolled out pizza pie (1/2 recipe of Marty's pizza
dough). Tope with chopped peppers and onions, cover with round tomato
slices. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook for about 20 to 25
minutes on 450 degrees, or until crust is brown and cheese melted. (I
omit pizza sauce for this one. If you've never tried it... try it
just once, you might be surprised how good it is without sauce. Make
sure the pizza is completely covered with vegetables, sometimes I use
very finely chopped broccoli with this as well, and if I feel
adventurous, jalapeno peppers).
