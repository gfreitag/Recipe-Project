ROLL DOUGH:

Dissolve the sugar in the water and milk, then add the yeast,
stirring to dissolve, and let sit for 10 minutes.  Combine the flour,
butter (which has been cut into small pieces), and the yeast mixture,
kneading until the dough forms a smooth ball.  Or, in a food
processor with the machine running, add the butter to the flour, then
add the yeast mixture.  Process until the dough forms a ball, adding
flour or milk as necessary.  Let rest for a few minutes, then process
1 minute more.  Place in a lightly oiled bowl, turing once to oil the
top, cover and let rise until double in bulk.

POPPY SEED FILLING:

Pour boiling water over the seeds, let stand for 5 minutes, pour off
the water and repeat, draining well.  Cover with the milk in a
saucepan and bring to a boil, then strain.  Grind with the steel
blade in a blender or processor until the seeds release the milk and
turn white, then add the sugar, honey, and butter.  Cook in a heavy
skillet for 1 minute over high heat.  Cool.  When cool, add the egg
whites and zests, blending well.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a long rectangle
about 1-inch thick.  Spread the filling evenly over the dough
stopping 1-inch from one long edge and roll up, making sure that the
filling is sealed inside.  Place on a non-stick baking sheet, seam
side down.  Bake in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven for 35 to 40
minutes.  Brush with thegg laze and cool on a wire rack.
