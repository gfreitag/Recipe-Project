NOTES:

*  Moist cookies with cranberries, apples and cinnamon -- Many years
ago one of my brothers complained to me that he didn't like cookies
much, that they were always too dry and pasty. I came up with this
recipe for him. He still doesn't like cookies, but the recipe has
made its way to various other people to become a favorite.

*  Don't store these in a cookie jar, they will get too mushy.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes baking.
