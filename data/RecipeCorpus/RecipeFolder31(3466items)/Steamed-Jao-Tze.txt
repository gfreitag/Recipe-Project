Title: Steamed Jao-Tze
Categories: Breads, Chinese, Meats
Yield: 5 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
2 c  Flour, all purpose
12 tb Water, cold
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 lb Pork, ground OR
1 lg Egg, lightly beaten
Salt (to taste)
1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Cornstarch
1/2 ts Monosodium glutamate,
-- (Accent -meat
-- tenderizer)
1 1/2 tb Wine, Shao hsing, OR
1 1/2 tb Sherry, dry
1 tb Sauce, soy, dark
1/2 c  Scallions, green part
-- included
5 oz Broth, chicken
For the Dough:
==============

Put the flour into a mixing bowl and stir in the water gradually,
using a fork or a spoon in the beginning, then your hands.  Knead the
dough in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes.

Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a clean bowl,
covered with a damp cloth.  The dough should sit for 30 minutes.

For the Filling:
================

In a mixing bowl, mix the pork and the remaining ingredients
(except the chicken broth) for the filling.  Stir the mixture with
your hands, using a circular motion, and always stirring in the same
direction. While stirring, add the chicken broth.  Put the mixture
into the freezer for about 15 minutes -- do not allow it to freeze.
It must be very very cold, but not frozen.

To Form the Dumplings:
======================

When ready to make the dumplings, lightly flour a working
surface and pour out the dough.  Knead it about 5 minutes, then roll
it with palms and fingers into a sausage shape about 13 to 14 inches
long. Tear off bits of dough and shape each bit into a ball about 1
inch in diameter. Flatten the balls of dough on a lightly floured
board, then roll with a rolling pin into a circle about 3 to 3 1/2
inches in diameter.

Put teaspoons of the pork mixture into the center of the circle.
Bring up the edges of the dough and pinch firmly in the center,
forming a filled crescent, using a little water to seal if necessary.
Leave each end open.

To one of the open ends of the crescent, fold the dough into the
center in 3 or 4 pleats.  Like the pleats in a curtain or in a pair of
pants, you're folding the point of the crescent into the center, and
pinching the dough to seal.  Gather up the balance of the dough on the
other side of the crescent, pleating it toward the center in 3 or 4
pleats. This method of sealing the dumpling gives it a broad bottom.

As each dumpling is finished, place it on a lightly floured
board and cover with a cloth to prevent drying out.

To Cook:
========

When ready to cook, line the top of a steamer with cheesecloth
wrung out in cold water.  Arrange the dumplings over it and steam,
covered, over boiling water about 15 minutes.

Transfer the dumplings from the steamer and serve them bottom
side up, with Jao-Tze Sauce I or II.

Yield:  40 dumplings (figure 8 per serving)
