Title: Grilled Radicchio with Smoked Mozzarella
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
1 lg Head radicchio
Olive oil for brushing
Salt and pepper to taste
2 sl 1/2-inch thick
-smoked mozzarella
Have ready a moderately hot charcoal or wood fire or preheat the
broiler for 10 minutes.

Trim off the browned edge of the radicchio stem and cut the head in
half lengthwise. Brush the halves generously with olive oil and
sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Grill the radicchio, cut side down, until it starts to wilt and looks
brown and a bit charred around the edges, about 5 minutes. Turn the
radicchio and top each half with a slice of smoked mozzarella. The
cheese will melt as the other side cooks. Remove the radicchio from
the fire when the cheese has melted and the lettuce is hot all the
way through. Serve immediately.

Note: If using a broiler, broil the radicchio on both sides until
done, then top with the cheese. Melt the cheese under the broiler
until lightly browned and serve.
