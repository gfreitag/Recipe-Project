Title: Parsnip Pure with Orange
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Parsnips, sliced
-cut about 1/2" thick
1    2" strip orange zest
1 c  Chicken stock
Juice of 1 orange
1/4 ts Grated orange zest
1 tb Butter cut into bits
Salt and pepper to taste
Combine parsnips, orange zest, and stock in a 10-inch skillet. Bring
to a boil over high heat, lower the heat to a simmer, and cover the
pan. Cook for about  hour, until the parsnips are soft. Discard the
orange zest.

Pass the parsnips and what is left of the cooking liquid through a
food mill or pure them in a food processor. Stir in the orange juice,
grated zest, butter, salt and pepper and serve.

Note: This can be made a few days ahead. Either reheat it gently on
top of the stove, stirring often, or put the pure in an ovenproof
casserole and reheat, covered, in a 375F oven. You can also leave the
casserole uncovered and top it with buttered crumbs if you like.
