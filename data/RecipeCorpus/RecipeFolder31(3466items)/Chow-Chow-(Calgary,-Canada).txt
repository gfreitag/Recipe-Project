Categories: Tomatoes, Relishes
Yield: 16 servings

Peel onions and slice in 1/4" slices then cut up the slices in 1/4" -
1/2" pieces.  Remove stem end from tomatoes and slice and cut them up
the same as you did the onions.  Mix the onions and tomatoes together
in a large pot with 1/2 cup salt then spread the other 1/2 cup of
salt over the top. Cover pot.  Let stand overnight.  Next day drain
off the juice. Then add 8 cups sugar.  Pour in vinegar barely to the
top of the chow, don't add too much (I added about 3 1/2 cups).  Add
the pickling spice in the bag and push it down among the tomatoes.
Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Then simmer 2 hours.

Remove and throw away spice bag.  You can check the taste now and add
more sugar if you want.  Pour into sterilized jars and seal.

Note:   Do not use enamelled pot to make chow chow because it will
scorch the bottom.

You can use the food processor to chop your ingredients - just do it
very coarsely.
