Trim the ends from the broccoli stalks.  Peel the stems with a
vegetable peeler.  Thinly slice the stems all the way up to the
florets.  Thinly slice 5 garlic cloves and mince the 6th.  Heat the
peanut oil in a wok over high heat until smoking.  Add the pine nuts
and stir until lightly browned, about 20 seconds.  Remove with a
slotted spoon and set aside. Add the broccoli and sliced garlic to
the wok and stir fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the color of the
broccoli heightens.  Add the water, toss briefly, cover the wok, and
steam the broccoli for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender. Uncover and
cook over high heat until any water in the wok evaporates. Season
liberally with salt and pepper and toss in the minced garlic and
ginger root.  Transfer to a serving platter and scatter the pine nuts
over the top.  Serve half.  Reserve 1/2 cup for Vegetable Blintzes.
Reserve 2 cups for Chinese Chicken Salad.
