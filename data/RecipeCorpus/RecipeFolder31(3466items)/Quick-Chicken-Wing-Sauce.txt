Title: Quick Chicken Wing Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Medium or Hot Salsa/Picante
3 tb Honey
1 tb Lemon juice
Red Devil Hot Sauce
Dry Mustard
Measurements are not exact!  You'll have to experiment until you get
the taste YOU want.  For a small amount of this sauce, start with one
cup of Salsa.  Add about 3 T honey, 1 T lemon juice (don't need this,
but it adds some tartness), and a few shakes of Red Devil hot sauce
(or Tabasco). Instead of Red Devil or Tabasco, use dry mustard which
doesn't "take over" the sauce as much as Red Devil or Tabasco.

Mix well.  Taste.  If not hot enough, use Hot Salsa or Hot Picante
and/or add more Red Devil.
