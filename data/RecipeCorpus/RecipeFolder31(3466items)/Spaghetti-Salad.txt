Title: Spaghetti Salad
Categories: Salads, Pasta, Tomatoes, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 24 servings
2 lb Spaghetti
3    Tomatoes, diced
8 oz Pkg. medium Cheddar cheese,
-shredded
2    Cucumbers, diced
1 bn Green onions, diced
(or 1 md. regular onion)
1    Green pepper, chopped
8 oz Bottle Italian dressing
Chopped ham (opt'l.)
Cook spaghetti.  Drain, rinse, & cool.  Rinse w/cold water again and
*drain well*.

Add all other ingredients; mix well.  Taste and add any salt, pepper,
etc. as desired.  Adjust and add more tomatoes, green onions, etc. as
needed. In the summertime, I also like to add some chopped fresh
basil and oregano. Let stand at least 2 hrs.  (The longer this stands
the better, so this can be easily made & refrigerated the night
before.)

Note:  This recipe makes a lot, but can be easily halved.
