This one was OK, but could
-probably again have
-benefited
From homemade ingredients
-instead of purchased ones.
- The
Prepared pie crust is kind
-of gummy, when even a fried
Crust should still be
-flaky.  I'd make my own,
-or even try
Something like a puff
-pastry coating, for that
-matter.
Chocolate Ravioli
1/2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Butter
8 oz Semi sweet chocolate,
-chopped
1 ea Package prepared pie crust
1 ea Egg
1/4 c  Milk
In a medium saucepan bring
-cream and butter to a boil.
Remove from heat and stir
-in chocolate until smooth.
Refrigerate until hard,
-approximately 2-3 hours.
-Form
Chocolate into tiny balls,
-less than 1 inch in
-diameter,
And freeze for 1 hour.
In 5-quart saucepan, heat 4
-inches of oil to 35
-degrees.
On a clean work surface cut
-each pie crust into half.
-Roll out with a
Rolling pin until thin or
-run through a pasta
-machine.
Place each chocolate ball 1
-inch apart on pie crust.
-Brush
Exposed crust with egg
-wash.  Cover with other
-half of pie
Crust and seal with ravioli
-cutter.  Deep fry in oil
-until
Golden brown.  Drain and
-serve with vanilla sauce
-and
Pureed raspberries.
Raspberry Sauce
2 c  Fresh or frozen raspberries
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Grand Marnier
Place all ingredients in a
-food processor and process
-until smooth.  Strain
Sauce through sieve to
-remove seeds.
Quick Vanilla Sauce
1/4 c  Instant vanilla pudding
2 c  Cold milk
In a medium bowl combine milk and pudding.  Whisk until smooth and
refrigerate for 1/2 hour.  Strain if necessary.
