Categories: Salads
Yield: 1 salad
1    Head Romaine lettuce, washed
-and chilled
1/4 c  Olive oil
1    Clove garlic, minced
1    Egg
2 tb Lemon juice
1    To 2 tablespoons red wine
-vinegar
1/2 ts Worchestershire sauce
4    To 6 anchovy fillets, cut
-into bits (optional)
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Freshly ground black pepper
1 c  Caesar style croutons
Tear lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place into large bowl.
Combine olive oil and garlic and toss with lettuce.  Immerse egg into
boiling water exactly 1 minute.  Break egg over salad, sprinkle with
lemon juice, vinegar and Worchestershire, and toss well.  Add
anchovies (if desired), cheese, pepper and croutons.  Mix gently, and
serve at once.

Note: For egg-safe Caesar, omit egg, use 3 tablespoons egg substitute
or 1 egg white combined with the 2 tablespoons lemon juice and
refrigerate 48 hours before using.  Or, use a hard-cooked egg and
puree with dressing ingredients in blender or food processor, adding
2 additional tablespoons olive oil.

Options: add grilled chicken breast, cut into slices, small cooked
shrimp or sliced oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes.
