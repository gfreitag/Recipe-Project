Title: Oven-Fried Bananas
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 60 servings
4    Ripe bananas, peeled, halved
2 ts Butter (or margarine)
Choose yellow (firm-ripe) bananas.  Cut them in half crosswise.
Spray a small square nonstick cake pan with cooking spray.  Preheat
oven to 450 degrees.  Put the butter in the pan; place in the hot
oven just long enough for butter to melt.

Place the bananas in the pan and tilt the pan so the bananas roll and
become lightly coated with butter.  Place the pan on the bottom oven
shelf and bake only 5 minutes, turning the bananas once, until just
browned. Serve with salt and pepper as a starchy side dish, or
sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar substitute as a dessert.

Eight servings, 60 calories each.
