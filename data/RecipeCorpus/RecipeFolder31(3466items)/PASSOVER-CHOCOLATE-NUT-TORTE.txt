Categories: Desserts, Jewish, Usenet

MMMMM---------------------------TORTE--------------------------------
6 oz Butter (or margarine)
3/4 c  Sugar
7    Eggs, separated
4 oz Chocolate (bittersweet),
-melted and cooled
1 c  Almonds (unblanched),
-finely ground
1/2 ts Baking powder

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
4    Eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 ts Potato starch
4 oz Chocolate (bittersweet),
-melted
4 oz Margarine, softened
1/2 c  Almonds, finely ground
TO MAKE TORTE:  Cream the butter and gradually beat in the sugar
until the mixture is light and creamy.  Beat in the yolks, one at a
time.  Blend in the chocolate, and gently fold in the ground almonds
mixed with the baking powder. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not
dry, then fold into the mixture.

Pour into a well-greased 10-inch springform pan.  Bake about 30
minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. degrees. Allow to
cool, then frost thickly with the icing and sprinkle with the chopped
nuts.

TO MAKE ICING:  Mix together the eggs, sugar and potato starch in the
top of a double boiler. Heat over boiling water, stirring, until
mixture thickens.
Do not boil the mixture, and beware of "scrambled eggs!" Cool, then
stir in the chocolate.

Gradually beat in the butter, one tablespoon at a time.  Fold in the
nuts until the mixture is thick enough to spread.

NOTES:

*  Rich chocolate dessert for Passover.  This is the only Passover
dessert I've ever tasted that is good enough to be making during the
rest of the year as well (when you can use corn starch instead of the
potato starch).

*  If you don't have a springform pan for Passover, use an aluminum
disposable cake pan and just strip off the sides when the cake has
cooled.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 5 minutes
frosting. : Precision:  measure the ingredients.
