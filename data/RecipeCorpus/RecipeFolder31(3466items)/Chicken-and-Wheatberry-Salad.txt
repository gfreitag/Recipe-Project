-breast (abt. 3/4 lb.)

*Wheatberries, also known as whole-grain wheat, can be found in
health food stores or in some supermarkets.  Or, call Meadowlark
Grain Co. at 1-800-EAT-WHEAT to place an order or request a catalog.

Day ahead: In a large bowl, place wheatberries and enough water to
cover by 2".  Soak wheatberries overnight.

About 2 1/2 hours before serving or early in day: Drain wheatberries.
In 4-quart saucepan over high heat, heat wheatberries and 7 cups
water to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 2 hours or
until wheatberries are tender.  Drain wheatberries; rinse with cold
water to cool.  Drain and set aside.

When wheatberries are ready, discard skin from chicken; slice into
1/2" thick slices.  Chop enough watercress to equal 3/4 cup; reserve
remaining watercress to use in salad another day or use to garnish
this salad if you like.  Cut nectarines into 1/2" chunks.  Cut celery
into thin slices.

In a large bowl, stir soy sauce, lemon juice and peach preserves until
blended.  Add wheatberries, chicken, chopped watercress, nectarines
and celery; toss to coat.  If not serving salad right away, cover and
refrigerate.
