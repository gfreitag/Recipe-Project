In a large (2 gallon or more) heavy stock pot, pour in some extra oil
and heat to frying temperature.  Season and brown chicken in oil over
medium high heat.  Add sausage to pot and saute with chicken.

In a 2 + quart heavy saucepan make a roux with the oil and flour to
desired color --- like peanut butter.  Add onions, celery, green
pepper and later garlic.  Stir continously until vegetables reach
desired tenderness (wilted).  Add roux and vegetables to chicken and
sausage in the stock pot and continue to cook; stir frequently.  Add
stock one ladle at a time and mix in each ladleful after adding.
Bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer and cook for an hour or more.
Season to taste.

About 10 minutes before serving, add green onions.

Sherry may be added at the table.  Gumbo can be served alone or with
rice. File (fee-lay [powdered sassafras]) may be added at the table
as a thickener

If you prefer, okra may be added; 4 to 6 cups add to vegetables and
cook with the roux.
