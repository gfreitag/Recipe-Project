MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
Almonds; blanched, slivered
Cashews
Mushrooms, sliced; added
-with the onions
Soak the potato chunks in a small bowl full of water until you need
to use them.

Heat ghee/oil in the saucepan on medium-low heat.  When oil is hot,
reduce heat to low;  add the crushed peppercorns, cardamom seeds and
almonds/cashews and saute gently for 2-3 minutes.

Add the chili, ginger, onion and garlic to the saucepan and raise
heat to medium.  Cook for a further 3-4 minutes, stirring lightly to
prevent browning or burning.

Stir in the spices and salt and mix well.  Drain the potato chunks
and add them (without the water).    Stir vigorously as you turn the
heat up, until potatoes are half baked and are covered thoroughly
with the rest of the stuff. (you can add a little turmeric too at
this point, though it isn't essential).

Reduce heat back to medium and add about 2 tablespoons of water.
Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer, stirring occassionally.

Gently stir in the spinach and simmer for about 20 minutes until the
potatoes are tender.  Add a small quantity of water if necessary.
Don't add too much water.  This is a moist dish, not a liquid one.

Cover it.  Turn the heat off.  It's done.

VERY IMPORTANT:
======================================================================

WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN SCREW UP: The intensity of heat you use to
cook is crucial.  So follow the guidelines exactly. When in doubt, be
conservative and use low heat, it will just take a few more minutes,
that's all.

Adding too much water will ruin it.

NOTES:

Total time required is about 45 minutes.  Less if you already have the
ingredients ready for another accompanying dish.

Quite inexpensive, even if you add the almonds and cashews and the
fancy geegaws.

VARIATIONS:

As already mentioned, replace cumin powder with fennel seeds for a
Moghlai taste.

You can add a few fresh green peas to the equation.  If you are using
fresh or dried peas, soak them accordingly and add early. If you're
using frozen peas, you can add them after the potatoes.

You can sprinkle a very small pinch of masala towards the end of the
process, though I prefer not to, since masala can overpower the other
flavours.

Squeeze a lemon (or some concentrate) just before serving, or offer a
few slices of lemon individually on the side.

Add some paneer/feta cheese chunks, or even tofu while sauteing.

Puree all or part of the spinach in a blender.

If you plan to use this as filling for lasagna, either cut the
potatoes into small pieces or replace them altogether with peas.
