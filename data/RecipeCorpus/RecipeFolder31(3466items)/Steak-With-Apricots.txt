Steak: saute the onions and steak cubes in the cooking oil until they
are lightly browned on all sides. Stir in the apricots, add a small
amount of water to prevent sticking, cover the pan and cook over low
heat 20-30 minutes until the meat is tender.

Sauce: Melt the margarine, quickly stir in the flour until the
mixture is paste-like and immediately add the milk, stirring
constantly. Over medium heat, stir the mixture until it thickens,
then stir in the tomato paste and cook over low heat for a few
minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the sauce to the meat
mixture, stir in the raisins and pine nuts, and garnish with parsley.
