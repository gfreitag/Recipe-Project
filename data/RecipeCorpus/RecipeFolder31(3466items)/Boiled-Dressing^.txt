Categories: Salsa/sauce, Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
4    Eggs*
1/4 c  Vinegar
4 tb Butter, melted
Little onion juice
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Paprika
ds Pepper
Few drops Worcestershire
Whipped cream
*May use 4 yolks or 2 whole eggs.

Slightly beat the eggs, add vinegar and lemon juice and cook in the
top of a double boiler very slowly until quite thick and smooth. (If
you don't have a double boiler, you can use a bowl set into a
teakettle of water.) Remove from heat, stir in butter while hot.
Season with onion juice, salt, sugar, mustard, paprika, pepper and
Worcestershire sauce. Stir well until blended. chill well, then add
whipped cream to make it the desired thickness. This will keep any
length of time if out in a glass, covered jar and kept cool.--- Many
of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
