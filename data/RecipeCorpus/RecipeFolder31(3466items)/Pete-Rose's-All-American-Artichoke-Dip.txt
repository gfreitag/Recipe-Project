The Pete Rose Ballpark Cafe may be designed to look like a stadium,
but the kitchen is cooking up coconut-almond shrimp - not popcorn and
peanuts. "I look at coming here as going to a ballpark and talking to
fans. The only difference is, I don't swing the bat here." says Rose,
who hasn't stepped up to the plate since 1986. (Rose was banned from
Major League Baseball in 1989 for gambling.)

These days Rose is happy serving sports fans dips instead of doubles.
But, he says, "I still follow sports religiously." And with 60
televisions situated strategically around the Cafe, he and his
customer can't miss the latest scores.

The 17-time All-Star says that whether you're playing in the outfield
or running a restaurant, the winning strategy remains the same:
consistency. "I thrived on it as a ballplayer, and I thrive on it in
this restaurant."

Mix mustard, mayonnaise, salt and artichokes; add cream cheese and
blend well. Microwave 35-40 seconds. Serve warm with chips.
