12 oz Chocolate; dark semisweet
3/4 c  Butter; unsalted
1 1/2 c  Sugar
6 lg Eggs; separated
1 tb Flour
Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F.

Butter and lightly sugar a mold about 9-inches in diameter.  Set
aside.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler on top of the stove.  Remove
from the heat, add the butter and stir until the butter has
completely melted into the chocolate.  Stir in the sugar.  Add the
egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks, then shake flour from
a sieve over the whites and gently fold it in.

set.
