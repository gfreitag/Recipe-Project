Cook potatoes until very soft in small amount of water.  Drain.  Pour
1/2 cup milk and salt into the saucepan with the potatoes.  With
manual potato ricer, immediately mash the potatoes by hand.  Add
additional milk if they seem too stiff.  Stop mashing at whichever
stage you prefer - when the potatoes have been formed into noodlelike
strands or when they are as smooth as an electric mixer's end result.
(The Amish, because they do not have electricity in their home,
always mash their potatoes by hand.) Co ver with brown butter.

BROWN BUTTER:  Melt desired amount of butter in saucepan.  Allow it to
brown, being careful not to let it burn.  Pour over or mash into
potatoes.
