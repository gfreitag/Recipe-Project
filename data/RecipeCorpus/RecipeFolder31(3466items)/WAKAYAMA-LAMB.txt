With a Julia Child-autographed stabbing knife, pierce the lamb in
several places and insert garlic slices and mint (or rosemary).

Gloop together the oil, vinegar, Worcestershire, paprika, salt,
pepper and sugar.  Add enough flour to thicken this muck into a
paste.  Rub it all over the meat to coat.  Then roll the lamb in
flour and plunk it in a pan.

Shove the pan into a 500-degree oven until the crust has hardened and
browned lightly.  Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake
the lamb until done to your liking (somewhere around 30 minutes a
pound).

Boy, that's going to be good.  But if anybody reaches for seconds,
hit them on the fist with the spatula.  You want to save some
leftovers to serve with this:

Sauce:  Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, mustard, curry
and paprika and stir-cook a few minutes.

Add the broth and heat, stirring until it is smooth and has thickened.
Gloop in the sherry.  Serve over rewarmed slices of lamb.
