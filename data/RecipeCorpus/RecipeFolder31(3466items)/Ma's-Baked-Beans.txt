Title: Ma's Baked Beans
Categories: Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
2 lb Pea navy beans
1 c  White sugar
1/2 c  Syrup or honey
1/2 ts Mustard
1    Pork "honk"
OR
3/4 lb Salt pork, rinsed
In a large pot, cover beans with water and gently simmer about 20
minutes. "Just make them smile, don't make them laugh" Signe says.
You'll know they're ready when you blow on them and the skins peel
back slightly. Drain, save the water. Add remaining ingredients, just
cover with saved water, and bake slowly, covered, 6-8 hours. Uncover
pan the last 3 hours. Add water as necessary.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
