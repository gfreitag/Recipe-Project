Pacific Coast Grill - 1015 S. Howard Avenue, Tampa (813) 251-8406.
This is a "casual" place and has both vegetarian as well as m**t
selections. This is probably the best choice for vlf as the owner has
lost a lot of weight and he promotes low-fat cooking.

NK Cafe - 4100 W. Kennedy Boulevard, Tampa (813) 287-1385.  This is
also a casual place and has both types of items (veg. & m**t) on the
menu.

Mise en Place - 442 W. Kennedy Boulevard, Tampa (813) 254-5373.  This
is a pretty up-scale joint and you'll need to dress for the occasion
as well as reservations.
