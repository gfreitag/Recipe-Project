Title: Ninfa's Beef Ribs Mexico-Style
Categories: Tex/mexican, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 cn To 2 cans "light" beer
2    Onion
7    Lemons
6    Garlic cloves
3 tb Olive oil (or cooking oil)
Salt and pepper to taste
3 lb Beef ribs
8    Fresh jalapeno peppers

NOTE: This recipe is a particular favorite in the northern provinces
of Mexico where marinated meat dishes are a specialty.  The recipe
calls for oven broiling, but these ribs are also excellent when
cooked over an open fire.
~Ninfa Laurenzo

Pour beer into big pot; add 1 onion sliced in rings, juice of 6
lemons, 4 of the garlic cloves (whole), oil, salt and pepper.
Marinate ribs in this mixture 2 hours.
Remove ribs, drain and broil at 350Ã¸ 1-1/2 hours or until done to
your taste.  Serve with SALSO FRESCA made by finely chopping
remaining onion, chilies, 2 remaining garlic cloves, cilantro and
tomatoes and adding juice of remaining lemon.  Mix well; add salt and
pepper to taste.
