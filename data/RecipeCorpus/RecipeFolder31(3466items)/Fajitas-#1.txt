Title: Fajitas #1
Categories: Tex/mexican, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 lb Boneless chicken breast
2 x  Garlic cloves
2 x  Jalapeno peppers
1/2 c  Olive Oil
1/3 c  Dry Sherry
1 tb Chili Powder
2 ts Ground cumin
Slice the chicken breast into long 1/2 inch wide strips. To make a
marinade, drop the garlic cloves and jalapeno peppers through the
feed tube of a food processor with the chopping blade in place and
the motor running until chopped finely (10 seconds or so).  Add the
remaining ingredients and process until smooth (about another 10
seconds.) Pour the marinade over the chicken and let marinate for 2
hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator, turning
occasionally. Preheat the oven broiler. Drain the chicken, reserving
the marinade. Arrange the chicken on a rack on a broiler tray and
broil 3 inches from the heat source for 5 minutes; turn, baste with
marinade, and broil for another five minutes. Serve with warmed
tortillas, shredded lettuce, shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes and
salsa verde. Source: Pleasures of Cooking magazine, Jan/Feb 1987, p.
