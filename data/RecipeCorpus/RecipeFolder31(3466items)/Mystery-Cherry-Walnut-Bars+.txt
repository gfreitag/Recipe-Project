Title: Mystery Cherry Walnut Bars+
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 recipe
2 1/4 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Margarine
2    Whole eggs
1    Egg yolk
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Cherries
1 c  Nuts
I am dubbing this a "mystery recipe" because I found it tucked into
my 1918 copy of Fannie Merritt Farmers "Boston Cooking School
Cookbook." I have no idea how old it is or where it came from. It was
hand written. The only clue I have is that it calls for margarine
which is a lot newer than 1918. Looks good so here you are. As for
the cherry butter frosting it calls for, I'd just wing it like a
powdered sugar frosting with crushed fresh cherries and butter in it.

Directions;

Sift 2 cups flour and the white sugar; cut in margarine (here she
actually said butter but margarine is what she/he calls for in the
ingredients.) Pat into pan. Bake in 350 degree oven for 12 minutes.
Beat eggs, egg yolk, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. sift
remaining 1/4 cup flour with baking powder and salt. Blend into egg
mixture. stir in cherries and nuts. Spread mixture over crust. Bake
in 350 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes more. Frost with cherry
butter frosting.

To make this mystery complete, I will add that on the outside of the
folded recipe it says "Donnie, this is your recipe from Wagner."

Enjoy,
