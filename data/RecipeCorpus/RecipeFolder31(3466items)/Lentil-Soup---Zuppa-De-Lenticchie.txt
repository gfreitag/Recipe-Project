Categories: Soup/stew, Italian, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2 c  Lentils
4 c  Meat broth (stock)
8 c  Water
2 ea Celery stocks, chopped fine
2 ea Carrots, chopped fine
1 c  Crushed Italian tomatoes
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 ea Medium onion, chopped fine
2 tb Chopped parsley
2 ea Garlic gloves, chopped
1/4 lb Pancetta
1 x  Salt to taste

8 ea Thick slices Italian bread
1 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
See my recipe for Minestrone for description of pancetta.  The
flavour of this nutritious soup improves if made one or two days
ahead. Place lentils in a large bowl.  Add enough cold water to cover
and let stand overnight. Discard any lentils that float to the
surface. Drain and rinse lentils thoroughly.  Prepare Meat Broth (see
my recipe posted previously). Place lentils in a large saucepan.  Add
water, broth, celery and carrots. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat. Simmer 50 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Press tomatoes
through a food mill or a sieve, (only the pulp and juice of a fruit
or vegetable pass through a food mill. Skin, seeds and any tough
material remain behind), to remove seeds. Heat oil in a small
saucepan. Add onion, parsley and garlic. Saute over medium heat 2 to
3 minutes.  Add pancetta.  Saute 2 to 3 minutes or until pancetta is
lightly browned.  Add tomato pulp.  Season with salt and pepper.
Reduce heat.  Cook uncovered 15 to 20 minutes. With a slotted spoon,
place a third of lentil mixture in a blender or food processor.
Process until smooth. Return to saucepan.  Add tomato mixture. Simmer
uncovered 10 minutes. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Toast bread
until golden on both sides. Place 1 slice toasted bread in each soup
bowl. Sprinkle generously with freshly ground Parmesan cheese.  Ladle
soup into bowls. Serve hot, or at room temperature.
