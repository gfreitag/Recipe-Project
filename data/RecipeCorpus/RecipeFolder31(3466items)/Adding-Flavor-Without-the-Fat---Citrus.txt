Title: Adding Flavor Without the Fat - Citrus

MMMMM-----------------------NO INGREDIENTS----------------------------
Citrus fruits not only add distinctive flavor to seafoods, but their
vibrant colors of yellow, green and orange gibe them double duty as
eye-catching garnishes. Slices, twists, knots, fine zest curls or
strips add a splash of color quickly and easily.

The easiest way to grate citrus zest is to use the nubby pointed side
of a box grater. Cover that side of the grater generously with a
piece of plastic wrap or waxed paper. Rub the fruit over the grater,
in a circular motion rather than just up and down. When fished, peel
away the plastic wrap and most of the zest will come with it.

The Acid Test: ~ Oranges: juices generally sweet, zest tart and good
for many uses. ~ Grapefruit: vary in sweetness, ruby variety
generally sweeter than white grapefruit; juice very good, zest quite
bitter, use sparingly. ~ Lemon: very acidic juice, zest very
flavorful and tart. ~ Lime: very acidic juice, zest more bitter than
the lemon.

Measurements: ~ 1 large lemon ( 7 oz) = 1 tbs. grated zest, cup juice
( 5 oz) = 2 tsp. grated zest,   3 tbs. juice ~
(10 oz) = 4 tsp. grated zest, 2/3 cup  juice ~ 1
~ 1 large  lime
1 medium orange
medium grapefruit ( 1 lb) = 2 tbs. grated zest, 3/4 cup  juice

The peel and the zest of citrus fruits are often thought to be the
same thing, but they are not. The zest is the part of the peel that
is brightly colored, the thin outer layer of the peel. The remainder
of the peel, the white portion, is called the albedo; it doesn't have
the aromatic flavor of the zest and is quite bitter. When a recipe
calls for citrus zest, use only the outer colored portion of the peel.
