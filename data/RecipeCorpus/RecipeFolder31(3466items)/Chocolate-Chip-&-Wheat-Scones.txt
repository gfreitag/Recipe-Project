Title: Chocolate Chip & Wheat Scones
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 8 servings
2 c  Flour
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/4 c  Sugar
4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Orange zest -- freshly
Grated
12 tb Butter -- cut into 12
Pieces
1    Egg -- lightly beaten
1 c  Buttermilk
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Chocolate chips
1/4 c  Walnuts -- chopped
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a bowl, sift together the flours,
sugar, baking powder and salt.  Stir in the orange zest.  Using pastry
cutter cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse
crumbs.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, buttermilk, and
vanilla.  Pour the liquid over the flour mixture all at once and stir
just to combine.  Stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts.  Line a
cookie sheet with parchment paper or grease lightly.  Drop the scone
batter by 8 heaping spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet, leaving as much
space in between as possible to allow for spreading.  Bake for 40
minutes on the center rack of the oven.
