Pie:

Put veal in a large kettle and cover with water. Cook slowly till it's
tender. Add rest of ingredients except fat and flour. Simmer until
vegetables are done. Drain, reserving liquid, and put mixture into a
casserole. Measure liquid, add water to make 3 cups. Melt fat, stir in
flour and slowly add hot liquid. Stir and cook until thick, pour over
meat mixture. Put baking powder biscuits on top so that they are just
touching. Bake in a hot oven until biscuits are browned. If you cut
the biscuits with a doughnut cutter, the gravy bubbles up around the
biscuits to make a nice top. Serve with the extra baking powder
biscuits.

Biscuits:

Sift dry ingredients together. Rub in lard, add milk gradually. Mix
to a smooth dough, roll out 1/2" thick. Cut with biscuit cutter.
Handle as little as possible to make light, flaky biscuits. Bake in a
quick oven. Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain
amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in
the book, typos and all.
