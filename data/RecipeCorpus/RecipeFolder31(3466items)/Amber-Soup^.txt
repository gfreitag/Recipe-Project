it and the other vegetables to the soup. Add cloves, season and
simmer 1 hour longer. Strain into an earthen bowl, cool overnight.
Remove fat; take out the jelly, avoiding the settlings. Mix in well
beaten egg yolks. Boil quickly for 1/2 minute, remove from heat. Skim
off top, being careful not to stir soup. Pass thru a jelly bag; ut

tablespoon caramel to give it a rich color and flavor.

stir constantly till a bright brown color. Add water and salt, let
boil a few more minutes. Cool, strain and bottle; cork tightly.
always ready for coloring soups. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
