Title: Veal Collops^
Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
Lean veal
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Mace
1    Egg, beaten well
Cracker crumbs
Cut meat into pieces the size of an oyster. Mix together spices, rub a
little into each piece of meat. Dip in egg, then into cracker crumbs;
fry. They both look and taste like oysters. If you don't have any
veal, and you substitute oysters, they'll still taste like oysters.
Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or
oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book,
typos and all.
