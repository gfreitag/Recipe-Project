Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 60 cookies
2/3 c  Molasses
2 1/2 tb Honey
1/2 c  Lard
3/4 c  Sugar
4 c  All purpose flour
2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
2 ea Eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/3 c  Whole blanched almonds
1 c  Diced candied lemon peel
1 ea Egg yolk
Combine molasses, honey, lard and sugar in a heavy sauce pan. Place
over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture
begins to foam and bubble. Remove from heat and let cool 15 minutes.

In a large bowl combine flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
Add whole eggs to molasses mixture; pour at once into flour mixture.
Stir until a soft dough forms. Divide dough in half. Wrap each half
separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours (preferably
over night).

Preheat the oven tp 400 degrees F.

Roll out half piece of dough at a time on a heavily floured board to
thickness of about 1/8 inch. Cut into rectangles about 2x3 inches in
size. Place on a greased baking sheet. Beat egg yolk with 2t water.
Brush cookies with egg mixture. Decorate the tops of cookies with
almonds and candied lemon peel. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, watching
closely because these bake very quickly and will burn before you know
it.
