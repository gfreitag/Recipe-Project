Yield: 5 servings
KISHKE (STUFFFED DERMA)
=======================
3 ea Ft Narrow or 1 ft. large
-Beef Casings
7/8 c  All-Purpose Flour; sifted
4 ea Tb Farina
1 ts Paprika
3/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
2/3 c  Finely Ground Raw Chicken
-Fat or Suet
1 1/2 ea Tb Onion; grated
1/8 ts Garlic Powder
When the casings come from the market, carefully remove all bits of
fat without tearing the casings, and clean thoroughly. Cut narrow
casings into 12 inch lengths for easier handling. Turn casings inside
out and throughly clean the insides. Mix all remaining ingredients
until well-blended. Sew up one end of each casing, and fill lightly
with the stuffing (the casings are stuffed inside-out). Do not pack
tightly, as the stuffing swells on cooking. Sew up the other end of
each casing. Place in boiling water to cover, then cook over low heat
for 45 minutes. Drain and examine carefully to be sure they are
thoroughly clean. At this point the kishke may be cooled and frozen
for future use, or it may be roasted at once. To roast, melt 1/4 cup
of chicken fat in a shallow roaster, and arrange 2 large, sliced
onions evenly in it. Prick the kishke all over with a needle and
place on the onions. Roast at 350F for 1 hour, until well-browned.
Baste twice with the fat in the pan. Cut into pieces and serve with
Jewish Style Roast or Tzimmes. Serves 5-6. Stuffed Helzel: The skin
of any type of poultry may be stuffed and cooked in the same way as
Kishke, but it is not necessary to turn it inside out. About 1/2 of
the above stuffing will be needed. Roat with fowl. From: The Original
