For the Tastiest results use the meat of mature bovine (beef) or young
Ovine (Lamb).  If using bovine, the meat can be either raw or roasted
rare to medium rare.  To serve Four, assemble the following

Dredge the pieces of meat in the flour.  Melt the butter in a
saucepan. When bubbly, add the meat and brown all of the pieces on
all sides. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Add the onion and garlic
cooking until the onion is transparent.  Add the tomatoes and the
water. Break up the tomatoes with a spoon.  Add the potatoes, bay
leaf, carrots, and celery. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce to a simmer
and let cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the corn, and spices to taste.  Bring the stew to a boil again,
cover and return to a simmer.  Cook for 15 to 30 minutes longer,
stirring occasionally, until the corn, potatoes and meat are all
tender. Uncover and cook for 15 minutes until the stew is slightly
thickened.
