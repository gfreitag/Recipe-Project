PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Combine chicken stock and clam juice in a small
pan or pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. In a Dutch oven
or paella pan heat the oil over medium heat, add the sausages and
saute to render some of their fat, about 5 to 10 minutes. Pour off
all but 2 tablespoons fat and return pan to stove. Add the diced
onions to the sausages and saute, without browning or coloring, until
translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and toss to coat with the
fat. Add the stock mixture, jalapeno peppers, curry, saffron,
coriander, fennel and cumin. (If using dried dill, add it now.) Place
the chicken, skin-side up, on top of the rice. Cover the casserole
and bake.  After 15 minutes, add the coconut milk or extra stock, the
shrimp, the clams and mussels and return to oven, covered. Bake for
another 15 minutes or until the rice is tender and the shells have
opened. Sprinkle with the fresh dill. Arrange on a platter or serve
from the pan. Offer Indian condiments such as lemon pickle, garlic
pickle or papaya chutney.
