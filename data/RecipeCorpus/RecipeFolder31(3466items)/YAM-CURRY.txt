Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Yams, tender
2 tb Salt (or less)
3 c  Vegetable oil
-for deep frying
Ginger root, fresh
-(2 inches)
1    Garlic clove
2 tb Vegetable oil
-(up to 3 T)
1 ts Cumin seeds
2    Green cardamoms
1    Bay leaf
4    Peppercorns
Cinnamon
-(1 inch stick)
1 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Chili powder
-(or use cayenne pepper)
1 ts Coriander, ground
1/2 ts Garam masala
-(optional)
Salt to taste
4 oz Tomatoes, fresh
-(or use about 8 oz
-canned tomatoes)
4 tb Yogurt
1 1/2 c  Water
1 tb Coriander leaves,
-chopped (cilantro)
Peel the yams, cut them into 1-inch cubes, place in a colander and
sprinkle liberally with salt.  Let stand 10-15 minutes, then dry on
paper towels.

Meanwhile, finely chop the onion, ginger and garlic, and roughly chop
the tomatoes.  Heat the oil over a moderate flame, add the cumin
seed, and cook until they begin to  splutter.  Add the chopped onion,
ginger and garlic. Cook until the onion is a rich golden color.  Add
all the spices and season with salt to taste.  Cook a few seconds
more and then add the tomatoes. Let this cook while you continue as
below.

Heat the oil for deep frying to 350 degrees F. and cook the yam
cubes, a few at a time, until golden brown. Drain on absorbent
kitchen paper. Set aside.

Add the yogurt to the tomato mixture and continue to cook until the
oil begins to separate out. Add the water and bring to a boil. Let
boil a few minutes, then add the yam cubes, reduce heat and simmer,
covered, for about 25 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with the chopped
coriander.

NOTES:

*  Yams in yogurt and spices, good lamb curry substitute -- The yams
in this dish are cooked in a sauce very much like that traditionally
used for meat. Serve with chapatis and rice. The recipe is derived
from one in "The Hamlyn Curry Cookbook," by Meera Taneja, which I
recommend highly.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
