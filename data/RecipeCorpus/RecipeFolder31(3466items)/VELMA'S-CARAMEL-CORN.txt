"(This recipe) occupies a special place in my private recipe file not
only because of its flavor, but also because it keeps so well. Once
cool, and stored in an airtight container, such as an empty White Cat
canister, it stays crisp and crunchy." - Carol Adkins, Pres. White Cat

Put the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, cream of tartar and salt in a
heavy saucepan.  Melt over medium heat and bring to a boil. Boil 5
minutes. Remove from heat and add the baking soda. Stir well. Pour
over the popped corn and pecans. Stir well, put in a baking pan and
bake at 250 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Pour onto
buttered cookie sheets to cool. From: White Cat Popcorn recipe
