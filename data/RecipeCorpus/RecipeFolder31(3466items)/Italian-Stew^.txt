Chop and salt pork and fry it till brown in a kettle. Add the
tomatoes, water and spaghetti. Cover and simmer one hour, then add
cheese and cayenne. This is very good. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
