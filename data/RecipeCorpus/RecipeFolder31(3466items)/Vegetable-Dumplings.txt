Categories: Appetizers, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 16 dumplings
2 ts Vegetable oil
3 tb Finely chopped sweet red
-pepper
1    Green onion; finely chopped
1 oz Fresh shiitake mushrooms
-- finely chopped
2 ts Finely chopped, peeled fresh
-gingerroot
1/2 c  Finely chopped green cabbage
1/4 c  Finely grated carrot
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 ts Oriental sesame oil
16    Gyoza skins*
Vegetable oil or
1 lg Cube vegetarian bouillon
-dissolved in 2 cups water
4 sm Sprigs fresh cilantro (opt.)
*Gyoza skins are 3" wide rounds similar to wonton skins, although
they are slightly thinner.  They're available fresh or frozen in most
Asian markets. If necessary, use wonton skins.

In skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add red pepper,
green onion, mushrooms and gingerroot; cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add
cabbage, carrot, soy sauce and sesame oil; cook, stirring
occasionally, 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Working one at a time to prevent Gyoza skins from drying out, place a
heaping teaspoon of vegetable mixture in center of each round.
Moisten edge of round with water and fold in half to enclose filling.
Pinch edges to seal completely.  Set filled dumplings on a plate and
cover with plastic wrap.

To make fried dumplings, heat 1" vegetable oil over medium-high heat
in 2-quart saucepan.  In batches, fry dumplings, turning, until
browned on both sides - about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and
serve.

To cook dumplings in broth, in 2-quart saucepan heat bouillon mixture
to simmering.  In batches, cook dumplings in simmering broth 3
minutes. Remove with slotted spoon, dividing among 4 serving bowls or
deep plates. When all dumplings are cooked, spoon 2 tb. remaining
broth over each serving. Garnish with cilantro, if desired, and serve.

Van Dyne writes: "This recipe can make two very different dishes,
depending on how you choose to finish it.  If the dumplings are
fried, they will become crisp, filled puffs that are great as
appetizers when accompanied by light soy sauce for dipping.  If
simmered and served in broth, however, the dumplings have a
translucent, ravioli-like appearance ideal for a delicate first
course."
