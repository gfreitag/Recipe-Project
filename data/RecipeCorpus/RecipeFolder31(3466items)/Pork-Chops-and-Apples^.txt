Brown chops. Place 1.2 apple, cut crosswise, on each chop and fill
with brown sugar. Bake in a moderate oven for an hour. Season with
salt and pepper. Easy. Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
