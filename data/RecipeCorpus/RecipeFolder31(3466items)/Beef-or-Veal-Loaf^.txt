Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 lb Beef or veal
1 sm Piece salt pork
2    Eggs
6    Soda crackers
1/2 ts Poultry seasoning
1 tb Celery, chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
3/4 c  Milk
Grind together beef or veal and salt pork. Put meat into a bowl and
make a depression in the middle. Drop in whole eggs. Crush crackers
fine, add to meat. Sprinkle on seasonings, pour in milk. Mix well
together and put into loaf pan. Bake at 350F. for about an hour. Pour
off the fat after about 50 minutes. Leftovers are good made into
sandwiches. But there usually aren't any leftovers. Many of the
recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
