2 1/2 ts Yeast
3 3/4 c  Unbleached flour
3 3/4 c  Semolina flour, finely grnd
2 ts Salt

For Starter: combine 1/4 cup warm water and yeast in a medium bowl,
let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup
plus 4 tsp room temperature water. Add flour in 3 additions, stirring
well after each addition. Stir until mix has consistency of a thick
and sticky dough, about 3 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer
starter to bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap
and let rise at cool room temp. until tripled in volume (it will be
slightly wet and thick), at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours. (Note:
starter can be made up to 5 days ahead. Stir down starter, cover and
chill. Bring to room temp. before using.)

For Bread: pour 2 1/2 cups warm water into a large bowl of electric
mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Sprinkle yeast over and let
stand until dissolved, about 10 minutes. Measure 2/3 cup starter
(reserve remainder for another batch). Rub between fingers and allow
starter to drop into yeast mixture. Beat until some of the starter
dissolves. Combine flour, semolina flour and salt in a large bowl.
Add to yeast mixture in 3 stages, beat until well mixed. Turn out
onto floured surface, knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes.

Oil a large bowl and transfer the dough into it; flipping the dough
to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm
draft-free spot until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Butter 2 baking sheets. Punch down dough, divide into 4 pieces. Cover
3 pieces with a clean towel. Roll remaining piece on floured surface
into a 14" x 8" rectangle. Starting at a long edge, roll up jelly
roll style, press ends and seam to seal. Using sharp knife, cut 1/2"
deep slices into the top of dough every 1 1/2". Sprinkle with
additional semolina flour and place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat
rolling and shaping with remaining pieces of dough.

Cover shaped dough with a clean towel, let rise in a warm draft-free
spot until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Position 1 oven rack in the top 1/3 and 1 rack in the bottom 1/3 of
the oven. If available place a baking stone on each rack. Preheat
oven to 450 F (let baking stones heat for at least 30 minutes. Place
1 baking sheet on each rack or stone. Bake until bread is golden
brown and sounds hollow when tapped on top and bottom, about 25
minutes. Alternate sheets about 1/2 way through the baking. Cool
bread on racks.
