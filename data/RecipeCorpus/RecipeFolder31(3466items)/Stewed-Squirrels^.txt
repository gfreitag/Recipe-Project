Categories: Game, Soup/stew, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
2    Squirrels
2 qt Boiling water
1/2 lb Fresh corn
1/4 lb Fresh lima beans
3    Or 4 tomatoes, chopped
1 1/2 ts Sugar
2    Or 3 potatoes, in chunks
1/2    Onion, sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tb Butter
Cut the squirrels into pieces. Put into the boiling water along with
the rest of the ingredients, except the butter. cover and simmer for
about 2 hours; add the butter and simmer another 15 minutes. Bring to
a full boil, remove from the stove and serve. By the way, grey
squirrel is even better than red squirrel and they are both better
tasting when hunted in the fall. Young squirrels may be fried. Many
of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
