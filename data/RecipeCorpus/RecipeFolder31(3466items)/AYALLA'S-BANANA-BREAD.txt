Title: AYALLA'S BANANA BREAD
Categories: Breads, Usenet
Yield: 1 loaf
3    Bananas, very ripe
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Shortening (butter)
2    Eggs
3 tb Yoghurt or sour cream
2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Walnuts, chopped
Rum, vanilla, or amaretto
-(optional)
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream the shortening and sugar.
Mix in the bananas.  Mix in the remaining ingredients.  Pour into a
greased loaf pan. Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but
moist, loaf of banana bread.

*  If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you
lower the oven temperature and cook for a while longer.  Otherwise,
the crust comes out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist
and almost undercooked.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  Preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes.
Allow some time for cooling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
