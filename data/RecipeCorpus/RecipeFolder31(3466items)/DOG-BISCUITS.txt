Title: DOG BISCUITS
Categories: Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
3 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
2 c  Flour, whole-wheat
1 c  Flour, rye
1 c  Cornmeal
2 c  Cracked wheat
-(bulgur)
1/2 c  Dry milk powder
-(non-fat)
4 ts Salt
2 c  Chicken stock
1/4 oz Dry yeast, active
-(one package)
1    Egg
1 tb Milk
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  Combine, in a big bowl, the flours,
cornmeal, milk powder and salt.

In a separate bowl, dissolve yeast in about 1/4 cup lukewarm water;
let it sit for a few minutes, until it bubbles. Add the chicken stock
to the yeast mixture.  Mix well.  Add the liquid to the dry
ingredients.  Knead about 3 minutes.  The dough should be stiff.

Flour a board with cornmeal and roll out the dough to a thickness of
about 1/4 inch. Cut out biscuits with cookie cutters in appropriate
shapes, and place on ungreased cookie sheets. Mix the egg and milk
and use to brush tops of biscuits (for shine), then bake the biscuits
for 45 minutes at 300 degrees F.

Turn off the heat and leave biscuits in the oven overnight.  This
will make the biscuits be bone-hard.  Though these are intended for
dogs, people find them better tasting than many health foods.

NOTES:

*  Homemade meatless dog biscuits -- This strange and wonderful recipe
appeared in our hometown paper's consumer column, for making doggie
Christmas presents! Although they are meatless, they are not
vegetarian, as they contain chicken broth. However, your dog is quite
unlikely to be a strict vegetarian. Yield: Several dozen.

*  These make a dandy birthday or Christmas present for your favorite
friend's dog.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking, overnight
hardening. : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
