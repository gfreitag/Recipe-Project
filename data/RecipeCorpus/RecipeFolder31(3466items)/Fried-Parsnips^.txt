Title: Fried Parsnips^
Categories: Vegetables, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
6 sm To 8 parsnips
2 tb To 3 butter
Salt
Peel parsnips and slice fairly thin. Heat butter in skillet till hot,
fry slices slowly until browned. Sprinkle with salt. These have a
sticky-sweet characteristic that is oddly flavorful.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
