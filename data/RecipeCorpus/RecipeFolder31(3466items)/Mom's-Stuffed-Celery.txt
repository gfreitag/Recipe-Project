Title: Mom's Stuffed Celery
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 sm Pkg Philadelphia Cream
-Cheese, room temperature
6    To 8 small Spanish olives,
-finely chopped
1    Dab margarine
Milk
Celery -- washed and
Scraped
Paprika
In a small bowl, using a fork, using a few drops of milk at a time,
blend the cream cheese and margarine until a thick spreading
consistency. Add chopped olives. Mix well. Cut the celery to desired
size pieces, fill with stuffing mixture. Sprinkle with paprika.

This also makes a great dip by adding more milk until it is the
consistency desired for whatever you want to dip into it. My
favorites are raw vegetables and chips.
