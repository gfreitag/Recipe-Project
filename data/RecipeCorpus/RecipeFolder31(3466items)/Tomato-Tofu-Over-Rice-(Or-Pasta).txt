Title: Tomato-Tofu Over Rice (Or Pasta)
Categories: Rice, Fatfree, Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
10 ea Ripe roma tomatoes
1 lg Onion
1 ea Several cloves of garlic (we
Like lots)
1 ea Red bell pepper (optional)
1/2 ea Block low fat tofu
Saute the onions and garlic in water or white wine, deglazing them a
couple of times.  Meanwhile cut up the tomatoes and rinse and cut up
the tofu (I love the White Wave version, since it's firm enough not
to fall apart when stirred).  Add the tomatoes and tofu and cook
until the tomatoes are nearly ready and add the red pepper. The
pepper should be barely cooked.

We serve this over Japanese rice cooked in a rice cooker, but other
rices and pasta are also good.  If we want more sauce or the tomatoes
aren't exquisite, we sometimes stir in some pasta sauce along with
the tomatoes.
