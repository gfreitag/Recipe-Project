Yield: 10 servings
MMMMM---------------------SWEET PASTRY DOUGH--------------------------
1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1 pn Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
4 tb Butter; cool
1 lg Egg

MIXING THE DOUGH: Stir together the dry ingredients in a bowl. Cut up
and add the butter; toss gently to coat. Rub in the butter until the
mixture looks sandy. Beat the egg and toss into the flour and butter
mixture with a fork. Press the dough together, wrap in plastic wrap
and chill it.

COOKING THE CARAMEL FILLING: Preheat oven to 350F. Bring the corn
syrup and sugar to a full rolling boil in a small saucepan over
medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in the butter. Beat the eggs
with the salt. Beat in the corn syrup mixture, taking care not to
over beat. Lightly flour the work surface and the dough. Roll the
dough to a 14-inch disk, 1/8-inch thick. Line a 10-inch tart pan with
the dough, trimming away the excess. Pour in the filling. Bake until
the filling is set and the bottom crust is baked through, about 40
minutes. Cool on a rack. The tart can be kept loosely covered at room
temperature, up to 2 days.
