Title: Sauted Scallops with Mint and Carrots
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 2 servings
2 ts Vegetable oil
3/4 lb Large sea scallops
-cut in half or quarters
1    Carrot, cut in
-julienne strips
1/4 c  White wine
1/4 c  Mint leaves, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
Mint sprigs to garnish
Heat the vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high
heat. Add the scallops and cook just to brown the outside without
cooking through, about 1 minute. Transfer scallops to a plate and set
aside.

Add the carrots to the skillet with the white wine and cook until the
carrots are brilliantly colored and just tender, 2-3 minutes.
Sprinkle the chopped mint over, return the scallops to the skillet
and cook, stirring, until the scallops are just opaque through, 2-4
minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon scallops onto
individual plates, garnish with mint and serve.

Note: substitute shrimp or cubed white fish for the scallops.
