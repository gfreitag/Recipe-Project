Title: Roasted and Smoked Sweet Onions
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
5 lg Walla Walla Onions, peeled
And halved
1/4 c  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/4 c  Basalmic Vinegar
2 tb Butter, melted
Salt and White Pepper
Create a 10x14" roasting pan with at least 2 layers of heavy-duty
aluminimum foil by bending the edges up into 2" high sides and
crimping the corners to hold them in place. Lay the onions in the
pan, cut-side up. Combine the olive oil, vinegar and butter and pour
over the onions, Bank hot coals on two sides of the bottom of a
barbecue. Place the foil pan of onions on the grill, centered between
the banks of coals below. Cover the grill and bake, gently turning
the onions and basting them with the pan juices about ever 15-20
minutes, until they are deep-golden and very soft when pressed. This
will take about 1-1 1/2 hours. Ultimately, they will break apart
somewhat, so don't be too concerned about keeping them whole. Serve
hot or at room temperature, as an accompaniment to grilled or
oven-roasted fish, poultry or beef.
