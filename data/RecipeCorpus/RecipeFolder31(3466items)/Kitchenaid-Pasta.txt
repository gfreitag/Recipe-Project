Recipe for pasta dough.
PS |Do you have a recipe that will work with the Kitchen Aid?

Here is what I use for lasagne and fettuccine:

2   cups  Semolina flour for Pasta
2   Tbs   olive oil
1/3 cup   warm water
large egg
pinch of salt (optional)
1
:

(Traditionally, the lasagne as well as linguini would not have any
egg. You could use 1/2 cup of water total and eliminate the egg.)

Put water, oil and egg in mixer bowl.  Stir with paddle to mix and
then add the flour.  The dough will come together quickly.  Just mix
long enough for the dough to mass on the paddle.

Switch to the dough hook and knead on low speed until it has formed
into a ball (this may take awhile as the dough will be dry and stiff.
Don't give up, it will eventually form a ball.  You can stop the KA
every now and again and push the dough towards the center to give the
dough hook a better chance of grabbing it.  After it has formed a
ball and is bouncing around the KA, knead for 4 minutes on speed 2.

Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
(Traditional Italian method would be to rest under a damp towel.)

Now you're ready to begin breaking off walnut-size pieces and feed
them into the KA.

HINT:  If the pasta sticks together after being extruded, aim a small
hair-drier at it as it comes out of the machine.  This will dry it
just enough to keep it separated.

You can make the dough in a processor also:  Put the flour and salt
in the bowl and pulse with the steel blade to mix.  With the motor
running, pour the mixed liquid ingredients down the feed tube and
keep it running until the dough is formed.  Take it out and let it
rest, covered. From: Richard Taylor
