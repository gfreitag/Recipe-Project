Van Geffen-VGHC42A
1 tb Ground allspice
1 tb Ground thyme
1 1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper
1 1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 ts Ground sage
3/4 ts Ground nutmeg
2/3 ts Ground cinnamon
2 ts Salt
2 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Soy sauce
3/4 c  White vinegar
3/4 c  Orange juice
x  Juice of 1 lime 1 1/2 c  Finely chopped onion 3    Green onions;
finely chopped 1    Scotch bonnet pepper; seed -and finely chop*  *(I
suggest that you substitute jalapenos as these are dangerously hot
and should be handled with rubber gloves.) In a large glass bowl,
combine the first 10 (dry) ingredients. Using a wire whisk, slowly
incorporate the oil, soy sauce, white vinegar and citrus juices. Mix
in the chopped onions and pepper. Use mixture to marinate pork, lamb,
goat, beef or poultry overnight before barbecuing. NOTE: The dry
ingredients can be mixed together in advance and stored in a jar, to
be used either as a rub for the meat or mixed with onion, oil, etc.
when a marinade is needed. MY NOTE: After mixing marinade I throw it
in the blender or processor to puree the onions. I like it better
this way. I always keep the marinade in my fridge. I like it that
much. Source: The Sugar Reef Caribbean Cookbook (wrv)
