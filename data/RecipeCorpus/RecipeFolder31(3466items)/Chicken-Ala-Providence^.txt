Title: Chicken Ala Providence^
Categories: Poultry, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1    Chicken
2 c  Stock
1 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1/2 c  Carrots, cooked
1/2 c  Peas, cooked
1 ts Parsley
2    Egg yolks
Seasoning
Cut chicken into pieces convenient for serving and boil gently until
tender; season while cooking. Set aside while preparing sauce. Melt
butter, add flour and blend smoothly; slowly add stock in which the
chicken was cooked and stir until boiling. Cook 5 minutes, add the
carrots and peas, the egg yolks and season to taste. Pour over the
chicken and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
