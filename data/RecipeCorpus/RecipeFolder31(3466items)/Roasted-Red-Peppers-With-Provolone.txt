Using long metal tongs hold each pepper over an open flame to roast,
charring all sides.  Place the peppers in a paper bag or covered bowl
and allow to steam for 10 to 15 minutes.  When they are cool enough
to handle, remove the stems and seeds.  Scrape off the charred skin

Sprinkle with the olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Taste for
seasoning.  Assemble sandwiches and spoon juices over the top.
