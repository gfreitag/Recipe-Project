Hi folks...:-) As my first venture into the world of food, I've
decided to plunge in here with a recipe that should blow the socks
off Betty Crocker. This recipe may seem a little unorthodox, but
remember it is recommended by the highest authority......Zen When I
came up with this recipe it was a spiritual awakening. :-) and
everything in it is TOTALLY legitimate, whether you choose to believe
me or not! Soooooooooooooo here we go!!!

This could be a very valuable recipe for those with cardiac problems.

1/. OKeedOkee!  Got the Specials?  -or Red Wigglers? Wash them...dirt
in this recipe wouldn't go over with the guests!  Keep them in the
fridge so they go to sleep.  The dandilions(?) no Fuzzies(?) Now,
wipe down the inside of a 6-cup mold with the oil. That's it for the
oil!

2/. Steam the dandilion florets for 15mins, then you get to use that
handy dandy POPeil dicer slicer gadget to chop up the florets and do
the same with the onion.  Squeeze out excess moisture from pulp and
add salt, pepper, nutmeg, mayonnaise, and lemon juice. That was easy!!

3/. Sprinkle the gelatin in the water and heat to dissolve.  Whip the
cream till stiff and fold into the gelatin water.....be sure to let
this cool down first.  nOW..fold in the veggie mayonnaise and include
those sleeping Specials.  Pour into the mold and bung into the fridge
for 2hrs to set.

*Green Mayonnaise!! <Back to the yard!!>

12 dandilion leaves 6 sprigs parsley 6 dandilion florets 2 cups
mayonnaise

4/. Blanch the leaves and florets in boiling water for 1min.  Drain
and refresh in cold water and you get to use that POPeil gadget
again! Drain & squeeze dry pulp and combine with the mayonnaise.

5/. Now to prep for the table!!  Unmold the mousse onto a lovely
Waterford plate and if you have extra Wrigglers handy you can curl
`em up in the centre of the mold.  Pour the green mayo over the whole
lot and SERVE!! Just remember...if any of your guests go into Cardiac
Arrest when the wrigglers get they're attention....just stuff a
couple spoonfuls into their mouths.  Works like a TrEAt!! If you
can't trust the author of "Zen of MacroBiotic Cooking", who yah gonna
trust? The FDA?! :-)

If you can't find Gippslands or Red Wrigglers....  I've still got
contacts out in the ritzy neighbourhoods where the best ones breed!
They seem to like lawns with automatic sprinkler systems!! :-) Just
drop me an email drop and we'll go from there!

There yah go, Cee aka GWS
:-)

What's that crawling across the floor? ...Oh..Dinner! * Origin:
