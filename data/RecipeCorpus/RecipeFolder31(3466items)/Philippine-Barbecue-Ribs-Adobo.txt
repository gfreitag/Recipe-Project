Title: Philippine Barbecue Ribs Adobo
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
5 lb Country-style loin spare rib
2 c  Palm vinegar
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2 tb Garlic; minced
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Salt
3/4 ts Whole black peppercorns
1/2 c  Thick coconut milk
Cut exterior fat from ribs. In a large glass baking dish or enameled
roasting pan, combine vinegar, water, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves,
salt and peppercorns in pan. Add ribs, turning in liquid to coat all
sides. Marinate 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature, turning ribs
several times.

Pour marinade into wide pot or 2 deep skillets with lids. Heat liquid
to boiling, add ribs, cover and simmer about 1 hour, turning once
until ribs are almost completely tender. Add coconut milk and simmer
about 15 minutes longer until ribs are tender but not falling from
bone. Remove ribs from pan and boil sauce to reduce it to about 3/4
cup. Strain sauce. Ribs may be prepared to this point up to day ahead.

To finish ribs, bring ribs and sauce to room temperature. Brush ribs
with sauce and place on barbecue grill over very hot coals. Cook,
turning once and basting with any remaining sauce until outside is
slightly crispy, 1 to 3 minutes each side.

To broil ribs, preheat broiler. Baste ribs with sauce. Place ribs on
rack about 2 1/2" from heat source and broil at medium-high heat
until slightly crispy, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Makes 6
servings.

NOTE:  To remove thick coconut milk from canned coconut milk, first
chill. Then, without shaking can, open and scoop thick portion out,
leaving watery portion behind.
