"This is a lovely light citrusy cake that keeps well.  Serve it with
sherbet or lightly sweetened berries.  Makes 8 - 10 servings."

Lightly butter and flour 9-inch round cake pan.  Put minced vanilla
and sugar in blender; blend until vanilla is completely pulverized.
(If using extract, add later with orange juice.)

In medium mixing bowl cream butter until light and fluffy.  Using a
sifter to hold back any pieces of vanilla bean that didn't
disintegrate, slowly sift vanilla and sugar into butter a little at a
time, beating continuously.  Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating
after adding each. Stir in almonds and orange juice (and vanilla
extract, if using). Stir in cornmeal, blending thoroughly.  Set
cornmeal mixture aside.

Mix flour, baking powder, salt and potato starch; place in sifter and
set aside.

In separate bowl beat egg whites to stiff peaks.  Stir in about 1/4
of egg whites into batter, then sift about 1/3 of flour mixture over
it. Fold flour into batter.  Continue adding egg whites and flour
twice more, foling after each addition and ending with remaining egg
whites.

Pour batter into prepared cake pan and bake in preheated 325Ã¸ oven 30
~ 35 minutes or until cake is golden brown and springs back to the
touch. Cool on rack.  Remove from pan.

If using, sift a little confectioners' sugar over top before serving.
