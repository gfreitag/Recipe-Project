Title: Slim Red and Green Pasta
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian, Low cal/fat
Yield: 8 servings
2 1/2 lb Red bell peppers
1 c  Thinly sliced green onions
1 cn Low-sodium garbanzos (1 lb)
-- drained
1/4 c  Basil
1 1/2 ts Tarragon
3 tb Drained canned capers
1 lb Dried curly pasta
-- (armoniche, rotelle)
Salt
Pepper
Place fresh bell peppers in a 10- by 15-inch pan.  Broil about 3
inches below heat, turning until skins are blackened all over, 15 to
17 minutes. Let cool, then pull off skins, remove stems, and rinse
off seeds. (Drain and seed canned peppers.)

Finely chop peppers in a food processor or with a knife.  Place in a
3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat with onions, garbanzos,
basil, tarragon, and capers; stir often until steaming, 5 to 7
minutes.

Meanwhile, fill a 5- to 6-quart pan 3/4 full of water; cover and
bring to a boil over high heat.  Add pasta and cook, uncovered, until
barely tender to bite, 7 to 8 minutes.  Drain pasta and pour into a
wide, shallow bowl. Spoon pepper mixture onto pasta.  Mix to serve;
season to taste with salt and pepper.
