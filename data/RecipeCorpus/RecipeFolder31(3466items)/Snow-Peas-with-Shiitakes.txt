Title: Snow Peas with Shiitakes
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 lb Snow peas
8    Shiitake mushrooms
1 ts Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Garlic, minced
1 ts Soy sauce
Salt to taste
String snow peas and then cut each one crosswise into 3 pieces,
holding your knife at a 45 angle, to form parallelograms.

Remove and discard stems from mushrooms and wipe caps clean with a
damp cloth. Cut caps into quarters.

In a 10-inch saut pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add
the shiitakes and saut, stirring frequently, until they are cooked
through and lightly browned, about 3 minutes.

Add the garlic and snow peas and saut another 2 minutes, until the
snow peas are bright green, but still crunchy. Season with soy sauce
and salt and serve.
