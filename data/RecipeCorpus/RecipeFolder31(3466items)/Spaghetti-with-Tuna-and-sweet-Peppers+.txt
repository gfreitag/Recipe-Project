Categories: Pasta, Italian, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Spaghetti
2    Red bell peppers
1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 ts Garlic, minced
1/2 lb Fresh tuna, cut in 1/2"

Salt
Pepper, freshly ground
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Flat leaf parsley, minced
2 tb Capers
1. Roast the red bell peppers under the broiler or over an open flame
until the skin is charred on all sides. Place them in a bowl and
cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. After about 20 minutes take
the peppers out, cut them in half, remove the core and scrape away
the blistered skin and the seeds. Cut them into strips about 1 1/2"
long and 1/4" wide.

2. Pour 4 quarts of water into a large saucepan or pot and place over
a high heat.

3. put the olive oil and onion in a large skillet over a medium-low
heat and cook until the onion has softened and turned a rich golden
color at the edges.

4. Turn the heat up to medium-high and add the garlic. Cook for about
1 minute, then add the tuna. Cook, stirring often, for another minute
or until the tuna has lost its raw color. Be careful not to overcook
the tuna or it will be too dry. Season with salt and black pepper.

5. When the water for the pasta is boiling, add 1 tablespoon of salt
and drop in the pasta all at once, stirring till the strands are
submerged.

6. Add the roasted peppers to the tuna, stir for about 30 seconds,
then pour in the wine. Once the wine has been reduced, stir in the
parsley and capers. Remove from the heat.

7. When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain it and toss it with the
sauce. Taste for salt and pepper and serve at once.

*Note: You can vary the pasta if you wish
