Title: Glycerine Soap
Categories: Information
Yield: 24 servings
1 c  Soap flakes (Ivory Snow)
2 tb Rubbing alcohol
1/3 c  Glycerine
1/4 c  Plus a tad more water
Food color
2 tb Cinnamon (optional)
Mix ingredients in saucepan. Over medium, bring it to a boil. (will
foam some like jam and jelly.)  Quickly pour into molds. (Candy molds
made from Wilton will work to shape them, but you can also pour into
a jelly roll pan and use cookie cutters to cut them out.) Only make
one recipe at a time. Let set overnight. Remove from mold and trim
any foam residue. Soap will be opaque or nearly transparent. If you
use cinnamon it will brown. Do not use food coloring with cinnamon.
