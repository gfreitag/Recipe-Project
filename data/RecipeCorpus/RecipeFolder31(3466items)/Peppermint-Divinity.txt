Title: Peppermint Divinity
Categories: Candies
Yield: 40 pieces
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Crushed peppermint candies
6    Drops red food color (opt)
Combine sugar, light corn syrup, and water in a heavy 2 quart
saucepan. Cook over med high heat to boiling, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon to dissolve sugar, about 5-7 mins. Avoid
splashing mixture on sides of pan. Carefully clip candy thermometer
to side of pan. Cook over medium heat without stirring, till
thermometer registers 260 (hard ball stage), about 15 mins.  Mixture
should boil at a moderate, steady rate over the entire surface.

Remove saucepan from heat; remove thermometer from saucepan.
Immediately beat egg whites in a large mixer bowl with a sturdy,
freestanding mixer on medium speed till stiff peaks form (tips stand
up straight).  Gradually pour hot mixture in a thin stream (slightly
less 1/8 inch diameter) over egg whites beating with the electric
mixer on high speed and scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally
(about 3 mins).

Add vanilla, crushed candy, and red food coloring, if using.  Continue
beating on high speed, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally,
just till the mixture starts to lose its gloss.  When beaters are
lifted, mixture should fall in a ribbon, but mound on itself and not
disappear into remaining mixture (3-5 mins).

Quickly drop mixture from a teaspoon onto a baking sheet lined with
waxed paper.  If mixture is stiff to spoon and has a rough surface,
beat in hot water, a few drops at a time, till it is a softer
consistency.

Store tightly covered up to 4 days. Makes 40-50 pieces.
