Title: Gnocchi Maison~
Categories: Potatoes, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
1 md Potato -- about 5 ounces
2 tb Virgin olive oil
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper -- freshly
Ground
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Parmesan cheese
2    Eggs
2 tb Parsley -- chopped
Place the potato in a small saucepan and cover it with water.  Bring
to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and boil gently for about
40 minutes, until tender.  Drain and let cool.  When the potato is
cool enough to handle, peel it, and set aside. Place 1/2 cup water, 1
tablespoon of the oil, the salt, and the pepper in a saucepan and
bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the flour all at once.
Mix well with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a ball, and then
place the pan back over the heat for 15 or 20 seconds to dry out the
dough a little. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Bring 5 cups of
water to a boil in a saucepan. Meanwhile, transfer the ball of dough
to the bowl of a food processor and add the potato in pieces.
Process for 5 seconds.  Add 1 Tbs of the cheese and 1 of the eggs,
and process for 5 seconds.  Add the other egg and process until
smooth.  Place the mixture in a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch
plain round tip. Pipe the mixture from the pastry bag into the
boiling water, cutting it with a knife into 1/2-inch pieces as it
emerges from the tip and letting the pieces drop into the water.
Bring the water back to a light boil, reduce the heat, and boil very
gently, uncovered for 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the
gnocchi to a bowl of ice water. When they are cold, drain them and
place them in a 3-to 4-cup gratin dish. Add the remaining Tbs each of
oil and cheese along with the parsley, and mix well. At serving time,
heat the gnocchi in the oven at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes and
serve immediately.
