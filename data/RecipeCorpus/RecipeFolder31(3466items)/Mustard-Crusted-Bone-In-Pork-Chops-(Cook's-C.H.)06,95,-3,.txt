MMMMM-------------------MUSTARD COATED BONE-IN------------------------
-pork chops
6    Pork chops, thick cut, bone-
-in loin chops
Sea salt
1    Jar (8 oz.) "grey poupon"
-style mustard
3 tb Dry ground ginger
3 tb Plack pepper, freshly
-cracked
Canola or vegetable oil
Method;

1. Liberally salt each chop on both sides. Place 3/4ths of the jar of
mustard into a small bowl. Set the rest of the mustard aside.
Generousely spread top, bottom, and sides of chops with mustard.

2. grind whole peppercorns and place in a low flat bowl. Add dry
ginger and mix to combine.

3. Generousely pack top, bottom and sides of mustard coated chops
with the ginger-peppercorn mixture. Place on a large plate and if
grilling within the next 30 minutes, cover and allow to remain at
room temperature. Otherwise, cover and refrigerate up to 3 hours in
advance (actually this is the reccomended procedure as the crust
forms better.) Bring to room temperature 20 to 30 minutes before
grilling.

4. While the chops are marinating, prepare grill. Chops should be
cooked overmedium heat (fairly ashen.) clean grill with a wire brush
or crumpled aluminum foil, and lightly oil with a light flavored oil
such as canola or vegetable.

5. Place chops directly over coals when they are ready, and grill one
side till golden brown, turn and grill until done as desired.

6. serve with grilled peppers, onions and potatoes.
