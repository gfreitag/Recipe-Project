2    Eggs

These Plaice Goujons can be deep-fried or oven-baked. The oven baked
version tends to be less crispy but the fish is soft and tender.
Serve as a starter, and appetiser with drinks or as a light main
course.

Tip:

To make fresh breadcrumbs tear up bread slices and place in a food
processor. Bake in a moderate oven until golden.

Preparation Time: 10 minutes plus chilling time Cooking Time: 10-20
minutes Preparation: Chop the gherkins, capers, cucumber and parsley.

1. First make the tartare sauce: mix the mayonnaise, gherkins, capers,
cucumber, lime juice and chopped parsley together in a mixing bowl.
Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and put in
the fridge to chill while you prepare the plaice fillets.

2. Using a sharp knife, cut the fillets on the diagonal into 6mm
strips.

3. Place the flour in a bowl, add the salt and pepper. Place the
breadcrumbs on another plate and the beaten egg in a bowl. Roll the
fish first in the flour, then in the egg, then in the breadcrumbs
making sure they are well coated. Chill for 1 hour.

4. For deep-frying: heat the oil in a deep-fat frying pan until hot .
Add the fish strips a few at a time and cook for 30 seconds. Test 1
by cutting it in half - the fish should be white all through. Remove
and drain. Keep warm while you cook the remaining fish.

5. For oven-baking, heat the oven to 230C/450F/Gas 8. Lightly oil a
large baking sheet and spread the fish over it in one layer. Place in
the oven for 20 minutes, turning once halfway through. Transfer to a
serving platter and serve with the Tartare Sauce.
