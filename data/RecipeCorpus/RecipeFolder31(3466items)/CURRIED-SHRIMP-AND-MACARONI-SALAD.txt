NOTES:

*  A cold pasta dish -- This salad is quick and easy.  It's best if
made several hours  before serving, to get the full curry flavor.
It's been a real hit at potlucks. Yield: serves 4 to 6.

*  A honeydew ball is a ball of honeydew melon that is scooped out of
the flesh of the melon with a "balling spoon" or "melon baller."
About 1 1/3 cups of conchiglie will make about three cups of cooked
macaroni.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  25 minutes (includes time to cook macaroni and make melon
balls.) : Precision:  no need to measure.
