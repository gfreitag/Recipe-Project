Kishka

9 feet of clean beef casings. (Buy at a Kosher butcher if you can
find one) 2 c flour 1 c matzo meal 1 1/2 tsp + 1 Tbsp salt 1/4 tsp +
at least 1 tsp pepper 1 c melted schmaltz (chicken fat) or chopped
suet Salt and pepper

Wash casings in cold water and cut into 12 inch lengths. Tie one end
of each length tightly with white sewing thread. Turn casings
inside-out.

Combine flour, matzo meal, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and
schmaltz. Fill each casing loosely with this stuffing and tie the
remaining end. Drop into rapidly boiling water and boil 10 minutes.
Drain. When cool enough to handle, scrape fat off the casings with
the dull edge of a knife. Drop into rapidly boiling water (about a
gallon) to which has been added 1 Tbsp salt and at least 1 tsp
pepper. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 3 hours. Remove from
water. Brown for 1 hour around a roast or roasting poultry. (You can
also refigerate and then slice pieces about 1 inch thick and fry
