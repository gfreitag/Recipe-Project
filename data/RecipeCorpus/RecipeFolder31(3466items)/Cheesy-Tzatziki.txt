Title: Cheesy Tzatziki
Categories: Appetizers, Dips/spread, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Cucumber, peeled, seeded and
-grated*
1 ea Garlic clove, minced
2 tb Scallion, finely-diced
1 tb Fresh oregano, chopped
1 c  Sour cream
1 ts Ground cumin
1 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 ts Salt
*  Original "cartoon" strip calls for "1/4 hothouse cucumber" (and if
you think it's easy translating a cartoon strip into a MealMaster
recipe...)

Drain grated cucumber for 5 minutes in a sieve or strainer.  In a
medium bowl, combine cucumber with garlic, scallions and oregano.
Stir in sour cream.  Season with cumin and lemon juice.  Add feta
cheese and salt.

Refrigerate 2 hours.

Serve as a dip for kabobs or as a topping for baked potatoes.

Iris' note:  This can be made low-fat (and more like the Greek
original) by substituting thick non-fat yogurt for the sour cream.
