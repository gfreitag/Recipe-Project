Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Native amer
Yield: 4 servings
2    Beans, Anasazi dried
-or Pinto Beans
10    Coriander seeds
8    Juniper berries
1 sm Onion
1 tb Oil, sunflower or
- light olive oil
1 ts Chile, red, ground
1 ts Oregano, Mexican or Greek)
2 1/2 qt -water
Salt
Sort through the beans, rinse them well, cover them with cold water
and set them aside for 6 hours or overnight.  Bruise the seeds and
berries in a mortar and chop the onion into small squares.

Warm the oil in a wide-bottomed soup pot; add the onions, coriander
seeds, juniper berries, chili and oregano. Cook together over medium
heat for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain the beans and
add them to the pot along with the fresh water. Bring to a boil; then
lower the heat and simmer for 40 minutes. Add salt to taste and
continue cooking until the beans are as tender as you like them --
probably another 30 minutes or so. When done, check the seasonings.
Serve the beans in a bowl with the broth.

There are a lot of tasty additions you can use -- cilantro, mint,
scallions, spoonfuls of thick Mexican cream, cheese and so forth, but
try the beans plain first. They should have a wonderful clean,
uncluttered taste that can be quite refreshing.

Anasazi is a Navajo word that means "ancient one".  The beans are
pretty, mottled purple and white.  They were grown in ancient times
by the Anasazi Indians and now are being cultivated in Colorado. They
can be found in natural food stores.
