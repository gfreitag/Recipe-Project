Title: Oignons Glace A Brun (Brown Braised Onions)
Categories: Holiday, Vegetables, French, Side dish
Yield: 1 servings
18    Peeled white onions (18-24)
-about 1 inch in diameter
1 1/2 tb Butter
1 1/2 tb Oil
1/2 c  Brown stock, canned beef
-bouillon, dry white wine
-red wine, or water
Salt and pepper to taste
1 md Herb bouquet: 4 sprigs
-parsley, 1/2 bay leaf
-and 1/4t thyme tied
-in cheesecloth
Using a 9-10 inch enameled skillet, add butter and oil.  When
sizzling, add the onions and saute over moderate heat for about 10
mins, roling the onions about so they will brown as evenly as
possible.  Be careful not to break their skins.  You cannot expect
them to brown uniformly.

Pour in the liquid, season to taste, and add the herb bouquet.  Cover
and simmer slowly for 40-50 mins, until the onions are perfectly
tender but retain their shape and the liquid has evaporated.  Remove
the herb bouquet. From Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French
