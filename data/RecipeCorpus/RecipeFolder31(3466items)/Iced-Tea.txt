Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 servings
Tea bags - 5 or 6
1 ga Water
To make tea the easy way, fill a gallon container with water and add
5-6 tea bags. Refrigerate overnight.

OR bring about 2 cups of water to a boil, add the tea bags, let boil
for only 10-15 seconds. Cover, let stand about 30 minutes. Fill a
gallon container 3/4 full with water and add the hot tea AND the tea
bags. Fill the container to the top with water.

Leaving the tea bags in the water prevents scum forming on the tea!

Home Remedy: Tea contains theophylline, which is a bronchodilator.
Therefore, tea is good for breathing problems, colds, etc.  Instant
tea does NOT contain theophylline.
