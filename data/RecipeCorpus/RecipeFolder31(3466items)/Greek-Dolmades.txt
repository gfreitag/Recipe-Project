Categories: Appetizers, Greek, Rice, Vegetables
Yield: 30 dolmades
16 oz Brine-packed grape leaves
1 1/4 c  White rice, shortgrain
3 1/2 c  Vegetable broth
1 ea Onion, finely chopped
1/2 c  Olive oil
1 ea Garlic clove, minced
2 tb Dill, minced
1/2 c  Parsley, minced
1/2 c  Lemon juice
Salt & pepper
Unfold grape leaves & rinse with cold water.  Remove & discard small
stem from each leaf.  Pat dry & set aside.

Bring rice & broth to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover & simmer
until the rice is tender, about 25 minutes.  Let cool to room
temperature.

Saute onions in 3 tb olive oil until translucent, about 10 minutes,
stirring frequently.  Stir in garlic, dill, parsley & half the lemon
juice, remove from heat.

Add onion mixture to rice.  Season & mix well.  Preheat oven to 350F.

On a flat surface, place one leaf smooth side down with stem towards
you. With wet hands, roll one ts rice mixture in the palm of your
hand into a cylinder shape.  Place filling at stem end of the leaf &
begin rolling the leaf, folding both sides.  Continue rolling to
enclose the filling & make a tight bundle.

Place filled leaf in a 9" X 13" baking dish.  Repeat with remaining
grape leaves & rice mixture.

Drizzle with remaining oil & juice.  Cover with foil & bake until
tender, about 30 minutes.

Remove from oven, allow to cool for 10 minutes & refrigerate.  Serve
chilled or at room temperature.
