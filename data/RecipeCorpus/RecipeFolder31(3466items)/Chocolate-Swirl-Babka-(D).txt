Categories: Jewish, Breads
Yield: 12 servings
1/3 c  Milk
1 pk Yeast
1/2 c  Sugar
2    Sticks Butter (1 Cup)
4 lg Egg Yolks
4 c  Flour
ds Salt
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 oz Bittersweet Chocolate
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Butter
1/4 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
MMMMM--------------------------MERANGUE-------------------------------
2    Egg Whites
1/4 c  Sugar
Heat the milk to lukewarm and add the yeast with 1 tsp of the sugar.
Stir till blended. Let sit 10 minutes or until the yeast starts to
bubble.

Cut butter into small bits, place in food processor or mixer and add
yolks and yeast mixture, blending well. Gradually add the flour,
salt, and sugar, beating into a soft dough. Cover and leave in the
refrigerator overnight or at least 6 hours.

Remove dough from refrigerator and leave at room temp for 45 minutes.

Filling: Melt chocolate, add sugar, butter and milk. Heat about 15
minutes on low heat stirring occasionally until thickened. Add the
vanilla and let cool.

Meringue: Bring the egg whites to room temp, beat with the sugar to
make a stiff, but not dry, meringue.

Divide the dough in half. Sprinkle with flour, knead the dough
briefly and roll out into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Spread
with half the chocolate and then half the meringue. Roll up like a
jelly roll and place in half of a greased tube pan. Repeat the
process with the remaining dough, chocolate and meringue, fitting it
in the other half of the pan. Pinch the ends together to form a
circle. Don't worry if some of the filling oozes out.

Cover and let rise 1 hour.

Bake 35-45 minutes 350. Cool about 1/2 hour in the pan. Remove and
serve.
