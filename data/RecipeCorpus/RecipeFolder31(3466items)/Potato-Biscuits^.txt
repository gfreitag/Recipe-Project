Yield: 1 servings
1    Good sized potato
1 1/2 c  Flour
4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Shortening

1 c  Milk, about
Boil and mash potato till it's free from lumps. Sift flour, salt and
baking powder together. Add potatoes and rub in shortening. Mix to a
light dough with the egg and milk, roll out a little thinner than an
ordinary biscuit; bake in a hot oven (425 degrees) for 10-15 minutes
till brown. Serve as soon as they are done.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
