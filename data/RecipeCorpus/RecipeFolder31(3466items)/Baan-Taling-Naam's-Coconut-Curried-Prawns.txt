Title: Baan Taling Naam's Coconut Curried Prawns
Categories: Asian, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Shrimp
1 tb Canola oil
2 cl Garlic; minced
1    Shallot; thinly sliced
2 ts Thai red curry paste
.  more to taste
1 1/2 c  Coconut milk
1 tb Fish sauce; or to taste
3 tb Cilantro; chopped
*or* green onion tops
Peel and devein the shrimp.  Heat the wok over medium heat.  Swirl in
the oil.  Add the garlic and shallot and stir-fry until fragrant but
not brown about 20 seconds.  Add the curry paste and stir-fry about
20 seconds.

Stir in the coconut milk.  Bring to a boil.  Simmer the sauce until
thickened, like heavy cream, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the shrimp and fish sauce and simmer until the shrimp is
cooked (they will be firm and pink), about 2 minutes.  Correct the
seasonings, adding fish sauce to taste.  Sprinkle with chopped
cilantro and serve at once with rice.

**  Fish sauce is a salty condiment made with pickled anchovies; if
unavailable, use soy sauce.  Thai red curry paste is widely available
at most Asian markets, gourmet shops and at many supermarkets.  If
you can't find it, use 1 Tbsp of curry powder.  The result will be
slightly different from the Thai dish, but still delectable
nonetheless.
