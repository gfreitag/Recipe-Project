Categories: Poultry, Salsa/sauce, Tomatoes
Yield: 4 servings
2    Cloves garlic
1/3 c  Fresh basil leaves or
2 ts Dried
1 1/2 ts Fresh thyme leaves or
1/2 ts Dried
2 ts Grated lemon zest
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/4 c  Olive oil
4    Skinless, boneless chicken
-breast halves
3 md Plum tomatoes
Preheat the broiler.  Line a broiler pan with foil.

In a food processor, mince the garlic.  Add the basil and thyme and
mince. Add the lemon zest (if using), lemon juice and olive oil, and
pulse until blended.  Measure out 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette to
use as a basting mixture for the chicken.

Place the chicken on the broiler pan and brush with 1 tablespoon of
the reserved basting mixture.  Broil the chicken 4 inches from the
heat until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes crosswise.  Place the tomatoes in a
shallow bowl and pour the vinaigrette remaining in the food processor
over them; set aside.

Turn the chicken over and brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons
reserved basting mixture.  Broil 4 inches from the heat until the
chicken is cooked through and browned on the second side, about 6
minutes.

To serve, slice the chicken across the grain on the diagonal.  Serve
with the sliced tomatoes and spoon some of the excess vinaigrette on
top.

Do-Ahead:  The vinaigrette can be made well in advance and the
chicken can be broiled ahead and served at room temperature or
chilled.
