A domestic duck requires almost twice cooking as wild duck. A wild
duck will take about 30 minutes in a hot oven and should always have
strips of bacon or salt pork laid across the breast while roasting,
to keep it moist. Both kinds of duck need thorough basting; wild
ducks are not stuffed.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
