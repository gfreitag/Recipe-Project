Title: PAO DOCE (SWEET BREAD)
Categories: Potatoes, Breads
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Potatoes; peeled
Sugar
2 pk Dry yeast
1/8 ts Ground ginger
3/4 c  Milk
2 ts Salt
6    Eggs
1/2 c  Butter or margarine,
-melted and cooled
8 c  Flour
Additional beaten egg
-(optional)
Boil potatoes in water to barely cover until tender. Drain, reserving
1/2 cup potato water. Mash potatoes to make 1 cup. Combine 3
tablespoons sugar, yeast and 1/2 cup lukewarm potato water and stir
until dissolved. Blend in potatoes and ginger. Set aside to rise
until doubled in bulk. Scald milk, add salt and cool to lukewarm.
Beat eggs. Add 1 3/4 cups sugar gradually while continuing to beat.
Stir in cooled butter. Combine yeast and egg mixtures. Blend
thoroughly. Stir in 2 cups flour, add milk and beat until thoroughly
blended. Add 2 more cups flour. Beat 5 minutes. Add remaining 4 cups
flour gradually, kneading when dough becomes too stiff to beat. Turn
out onto floured board and knead 10 minutes, adding only enough extra
flour to prevent sticking. Place dough in greased bowl, turn to
grease top, cover and let rise until doubled in bulk. Divide dough
into 4 portions, shape into round loaves on greased baking sheets or
place in greased loaf pans. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk.
Brush loaves with additional beaten egg, if desired. Bake at 350F 20
minutes, then lower heat to 325F and bake about 20 minutes longer, or
until brown.

Makes 4 loaves
