Title: Mole Poblano
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Tex/mexican
Yield: 7 servings
1/2 lb Dried pasilla ancho chiles
3 1/4 oz Mexican chocolate (circle)
2 tb Unsalted peanuts
2 tb Almonds
2 tb Sesame seeds
2 tb Raisins
1 1/2 ts Anise seeds
2    Cinnamon sticks
3    Whole cloves
3    Peppercorns
2    Garlic cloves
2    Onion slices -- 1" thick
1    Tortilla -- fried crisp
5 tb Sugar
Salt
3 tb Oil
Remove and discard seeds and stems from chiles. Place chiles in
saucepan, cover with water, bring to boil, remove from heat and let
chiles stand until soft. Place chocolate in bowl, cover with warm tap
water and let stand 10 minutes, until slightly softened but not
dissolved. In a large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven combine peanuts,
almonds, sesame seeds, raisins, anise, cinnamon sticks, cloves,
peppercorns, garlic and 1 onion slice.  Cook over low heat,
uncovered, very gently for 30 minutes, stirring often to keep from
burning.  Place in bowl and cover generously with water. Soak until
slightly softened, making them easier to grind. Drain chiles. In
batches, combine some of chiles and some of cooked onion mixture,
fried tortilla and chocolate in blender and blend until finely
ground. To facilitate blending, add chile soaking liquid and liquid
in which nuts and spices were soaked.  Sauce should be very fluid
rather than a paste. Put through sieve to eliminate solids.  Add
sugar and salt to taste. Heat oil in 3 quart pot.  Add remaining
onion slice and cook until lightly browned. Add sauce mixture to
onion and oil and simmer 15 minutes.  Sauce can be prepared in
advance and reheated at serving time.
