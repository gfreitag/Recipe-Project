Cut a pocket into the beef by making a horizantal slit deep into the
meat, but not cutting entirely to the other side. Place the oysters
in the bottom half of the meat and cover the oysters with the
mushroom slices. Close the meat and skewer it or sew it closed with
thread. Brush some olive oil over the surface of the meat and
sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Grill the meat 4 to 6 inches away
from the coals for about 10 to 12 minutes per side, or until it
reaches the desired doneness. Submitted By JOELL ABBOTT   On
