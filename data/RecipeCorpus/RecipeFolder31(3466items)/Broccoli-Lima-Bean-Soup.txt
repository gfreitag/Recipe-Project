In a large saucepan, bring broth to a boil over high heat.  Add lima
beans, broccoli, carrots, onions, soy sauce, garlic and ginger root.
Return to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or
until beans are just tender.  Stir in sesame seeds and, if desired,
sherry.

Cook's Tip:  You can keep any unused ginger root fresh for several
months. Just submerge it in a jar of dry sherry.  Cover the jar
tightly and store it in the refrigerator.  Or wrap the ginger root in
plastic wrap and store it in the freezer.
