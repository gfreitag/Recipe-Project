sugar, and egg until well combined. Whisk in the shortening.
Alternating in thirds, mix in the flour and orange juice mixtures.
Toss the apricots and pecans with the remaining 2 tsp of flour. Stir
into the batter. Transfer to the loaf pan. 5. Bake until a toothpick
inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.
Cool in the pan for 10 mins. Unmold onto a wire rack and cool
completely. Makes 1 (9 by 5-inch) loaf from Cecil R. Gerloff of X-G
