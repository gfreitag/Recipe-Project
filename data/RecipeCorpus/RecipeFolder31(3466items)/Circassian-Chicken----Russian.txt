Title: Circassian Chicken -- Russian
Categories: Poultry, Russian
Yield: 1 servings
1    Stewing chicken
- (3 1/2 to 4 pounds)
1    Small carrot
- scraped and diced
1    Med. onion
- peeled and chopped
1/4 c  Chopped parsley--fresh
Salt, pepper to taste
2 c  Shelled walnuts
3    Slices stale white bread
1    Large onion
- peeled and chopped
1 tb Good Hungarian paprika
Put chicken, carrot, onion, parsley, salt and pepper and 5 cups of
water in a large kettle.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
covered for 2 hours or till tender.  (The exact simmering time will
depend on the the age of the chicken.) Remove chicken from kettle to
cool. Strain broth and reserve the broth. Cut meat into shreds.

Put the walnuts through a meat grinder TWICE.  After each grinding
reserve the oil separately from the nuts.  Soak bread in some of the
strained chicken broth until soft.  Squeeze dry and mix with ground
walnuts, onion and pepper.  Put this mixture through the meat grinder
TWO MORE TIMES. Then gradually add about 1 cup of the strained
chicken broth to the mixture to make a paste or sort of
mayonnaise--type sauce. Combine 1/2 of this sauce with the shredded
chicken and spread evenly on a platter. Cover with remaining sauce.
Garnish with the reserved walnut oil by sprinkling it, along with the
paprika, over the sauce.

(This recipe takes a little time, but is well--worth it.)
