1 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder

3 tb Ice water

Combine flour, salt, baking powder, lard and butter and blend with a
pastry blender. Mix egg, ice water and vinegar. Add to dry mixture a

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
