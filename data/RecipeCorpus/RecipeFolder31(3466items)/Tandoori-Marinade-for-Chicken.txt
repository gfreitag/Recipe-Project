Title: Tandoori Marinade for Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Bbq/grill, Indian
Yield: 6 servings
2    Cloves garlic
1 tb Chopped fresh ginger root
1 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1/2 ts Red pepper
1 ts Tandoori coloring (or
-paprika)
1/3 c  Plain yogurt
If you left out the yogurt, you'd have a reasonably dry marinade.
Julie also calls for using unseasoned meat tenderizer & lemon juice
on the chicken before the above marinade is applied. Hope all of this
is of some help.
