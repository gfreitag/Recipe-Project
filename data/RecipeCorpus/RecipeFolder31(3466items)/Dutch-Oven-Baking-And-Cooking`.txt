Information Only-----
To slow-bake or simmer foods in a Dutch oven, use only moderate heat.
To estimate how many charcoal briquets you'll need, multiply the
diameter of your Dutch oven by 2. Place that number of ignited coals
in a circle that is the same size as the diameter of your oven. I.E.,
a 12-inch oven would use 24 coals in a 12-inch circle. The oven will
sit over the circle of coals, but don't put any coals in the center.
For higher heat to brown or boil foods, multiply the amount of coals
by 3. arrange 1/3 of the coals in a circle, and place the remainder
on the lid (use a small spade of long handle tongs). These
instructions are for charcoal briquets, but you can also use coals
from a wood campfire if you are an old cowhand. If a dish needs to be
cooked more than 45 mins, you will have to add hot coals. Light them
in a hibachi or charcoal chimney starter, or make another campfire
nearby. You will only need half as many coals to maintain the heat
level.
