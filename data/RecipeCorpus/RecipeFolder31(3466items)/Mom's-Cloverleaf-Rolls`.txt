Title: Mom's Cloverleaf Rolls`
Categories: Breads
Yield: 20 servings
2 1/2 ts Active Dry Yeast
2 c  Warm Water (100 To 110 F)
1/3 c  Vegetable Oil
1/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
4 1/2 c  (Approx) Unbleached Flour,
-Preferably Bread Flour
1. In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water and let stand
until creamy, about 10 mins; stir to dissolve. 2. In a large bowl,
mix the yeast mixture, oil, sugar, and salt. Gradually stir in enough
flour to make a soft dough. Knead the dough in the bowl until smooth,
about 5 mins. 3. Form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly
buttered large bowl. Turn once to coat the top of the dough with
butter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place
until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hrs. 4. Lightly butter 20 (1
3/4-inch) muffin tins. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Divide
each portion into 5 equal portions. Divide these into 3 portions each
and form these into balls about the size of walnuts. Place 3 balls of
dough in each of the prepared muffin tins. Cover with plastic wrap
and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 40 mins. 5.
Preheat oven to 400 F. Bake until the rolls are golden brown, 12 to
15 mins. Cool slightly, then remove from the muffin tins and serve
warm. Note: For variety, brush the tops with melted butter and
sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds. Makes 20 rolls from Neil Shaw of
Stonewall, OK.
