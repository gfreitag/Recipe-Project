Beat butter or margerine in large mixing bowl with an electric mixer
on med to high speed for 30 seconds.  Add sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt; beat til combined.  Beat in eggs and lemon
extract til combined. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with
the mixer.  Stir in remaining flour.  Cover; chill 1 hour or til easy
to handle.

Roll dough, one fourth at a time, on a lightly floured surface to 1/8
inch thickness.  Cut into fruit and vegetable shapes.  Place on
greased cookie sheet.  Bake in 375 oven 5-6 mins, or til bottoms are
lightly browned. Cool on rack.

Meanwhile, prepare meringe powder glaze.  Divide into the number of
colors desired and tint with paste food coloring.  Frost cookies to
resemble vegetables and fruits.  Thin glazes with a few drops of
water to keep the flowing consistency.  Let frosted cookies dry
completely.  After glaze has dried, use a small clean brush to paint
distinguising marks with a little paste color thinned wiht water.

For glaze: With a fork, lightly beat together 2T meringue powder and
1/4c warm water til combined. Stir in 2c sifted powdered sugar til
combined. Gradually stir in about 1 1/2c of additional sifted
powdered sugar to make a smooth glaze that is spreadable but not
runny. It should have a flowing consistency and be too thin to hold
ridges when spread.  Makes 1c.
