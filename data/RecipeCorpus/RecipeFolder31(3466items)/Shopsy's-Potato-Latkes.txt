Kitchen Manager Nat Espinola who has been with Shopsy's for more than
10 years, took their large-quantity recipe, cut it way back, tried it
out and says it should work out well for anyone at home. It does.

1. Peel potatoes and onion, slice into strips and grind or process in
blender.

2. Beat eggs with salt and pepper. Stir in potato mixture. Then
gradually stir in enough flour to make a thick batter.

3. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a large frying pan. Using a scoop
gently drop potato mixture into hot oil. Form a round shape. Cook 1
to 2 minutes per side or until well browned. Drain on paper towel.
Add more oil as needed. Makes 8 to 10 latkes.
