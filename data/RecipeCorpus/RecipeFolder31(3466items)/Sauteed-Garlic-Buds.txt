These sauteed buds are a quick and irresistible topping for either
Southern style cornmeal grits or Italian polenta. To make more of a
one dish meal, add cubed tofu, canned clams or leftover chicken or
fish. Other additions that go particularly well with the garlic tops
include strips of roasted bell peppers and Parmesan cheese.

Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add garlic buds and
pepper flakes; saute 3 to 5 minutes over medium heat stirring
constantly. Sprinkle with salt to taste. Add tofu and heat through
about 2 minutes longer. Remove pan from heat; squeeze juice from
lemon over garlic buds, toss, taste, adjust salt and serve over
cornmeal grits.
