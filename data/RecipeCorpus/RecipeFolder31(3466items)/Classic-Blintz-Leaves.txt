CLASSIC BLINTZ LEAVES
=====================
Blintzes are popular on Shavuot, when dairy dishes are eaten. These
basic blintz leaves ++ thin pancakes ++ can be filled with a variety
of sweet or savory fillings, then fried to a golden crisp brown or
baked with a variety of sauces. They can also be frozen, taken
straight from the freezer, and fried in hot maragrine or oil over low
heat. The first variation is made with fewer eggs, resulting in a
thin , soft, pliable, but firm, pancake. Be sure to refrigerate
batter for at least 2 hours ++ to prevent rubberiness ++ then stir
briefly.
