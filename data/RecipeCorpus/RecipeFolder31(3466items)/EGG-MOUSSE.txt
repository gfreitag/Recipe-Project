NOTES:

*  Simple appetizer for summer days -- This dish was served at a
dinner I was invited to at the Vice-Chancellor's Lodge at the
University of Liverpool when I was a student. Mrs. Whelan, the VC's
wife, gave me the recipe later.

*  A nice way to decorate is to peel some white grapes and chill.
Then before serving spread thinly a little caviar on top and place
halved grapes on top of that.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  Measure gelatine and stock.
