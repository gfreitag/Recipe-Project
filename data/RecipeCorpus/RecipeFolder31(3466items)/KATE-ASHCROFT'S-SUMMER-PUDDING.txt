Title: KATE ASHCROFT'S SUMMER PUDDING
Categories: Puddings, Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
6 c  Bramble fruit (see note)
1 lb Whole wheat bread
Raw sugar
Heavy cream
In a two-quart pudding mold, crush but don't sieve the fruit.
Sweeten to taste with raw sugar (not brown sugar).

Tear into small pieces enough homemade whole-wheat bread, crust and
all, to pack the mold till it's full.  Refrigerate the pudding for
something between 6 and 24 hours.

Don't even dream of unmolding it, just spoon it out and serve it with
heavy unsweetened cream.

NOTES:

*  Uncooked fruit and bread pudding -- Here is my friend Kate
Ashcroft's Yorkshire version of the dessert known as "summer pudding".

*  For "bramble fruit" use some berry that grows on a brambly vine.
Raspberries, blackberries, presumably huckleberries and ollalie
berries. Some currants are OK, some gooseberries are OK, even some
blueberries are OK, but no strawberries, they don't fit the mood.

*  Day-old bread is better than dead fresh for this recipe, but not
older than a day.

*  For contrast, here is the standard version:  In a two-quart pudding
mold, truck out one pint of Woolworth's raspberry jam with enough
Golden Syrup to make a quart and a half of goo. Tear into small
pieces enough stale crumb, not crust, of bakery white bread to pack
the mold till it's full. Refrigerate the pudding for six weeks. Serve
with Bird's Custard Sauce.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 6 hours cooling.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
