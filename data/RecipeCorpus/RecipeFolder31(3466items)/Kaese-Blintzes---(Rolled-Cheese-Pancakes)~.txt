Categories: Diabetic, Holiday, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Dry Cottage Cheese
1 c  Pot Cheese -or- Lowfat
-Ricotta Cheese
1    Egg
1 tb Sugar
1 c  Flour
1 c  Lowfat Milk
3    Eggs
Vegetable Oil
2 tb Margarine
Plain Lowfat Yogurt
Make the cheese filling by beating cottage cheese, pot cheese, 1 egg
and sugar together.  Combine the flour and milk with the 3 eggs. Beat
to make a smooth batter.

Heat a 6- or 8-inch skillet.  Coat with vegetable oil and pour in 2
to 3 tablespoons of the batter.  Tilt the pan to distribute the
batter over the bottom of the skillet. Cook until the dough is firm
and browned.

Remove from the pan and place on a lightly-oiled plate with browned
side up. Spoon 1 tablespoon of filling onto the edge of the pancake.
Roll up by bringing the edge with the filling to the center of the
pancake, fold in each side, and fold over once more to make a sealed
pouch. Continue with the rest of the batter.

When ready to serve, heat the margarine in a skillet. Fry the blintzes
until golden brown on all sides. Serve with yogurt.
