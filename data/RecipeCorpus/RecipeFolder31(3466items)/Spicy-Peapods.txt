Title: Spicy Peapods
Categories: Vegetables, Indian, Chilies, Potatoes, Hot/spicy
Yield: 1 recipe
1 lb Fresh peas in the pod
2 md Potatoes; peeled & diced
1/4 ts Mustard seeds
1/4 ts Urad dal
2    Red chillies
1/4    Coconut
1/2 oz Tamarind
Salt; to taste
1/2 ts Turmeric
Grated jaggery; to taste
Fresh coriander leaves
[Remove peas from pods; reserve peas for another use.]

Prepare the pods by separating each into two halves.  Remove the inner
lining from each half by bending the stem end inwards until it cracks
but doesn't break off completely.  Gently pull stem down, peeling off
inner lining from pod half.  Discard linings and wash the outer
portions.

In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil and fry mustard seeds,
urad dal and chillies until dal is reddish in color.  Add pods,
potatoes, salt and turmeric, and cook for 5 minutes.  Pour in 1 cup
water and continue cooking until vegetables are almost done.

Meanwhile, grind coconut, tamarind and jaggery to a paste.  Stir into
peapod mixture towards the end of cooking time; continue cooking until
vegetables are done.  Serve hot, garnished with coriander leaves.
