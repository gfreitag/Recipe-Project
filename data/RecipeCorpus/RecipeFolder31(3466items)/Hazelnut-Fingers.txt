1 c  Dry roasted hazelnuts (see
-Note)
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour, divided
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Confectioners' sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
-chilled and cut into
-1/2-inch
cc 1 large egg, chilled
4 ts Vanilla extract
MMMMM--------------------------ASSEMBLY-------------------------------
Two 3-ounce bars Swiss hazelnut cream-filled milk chocolate bars,
coarsely chopped 9 ounces Swiss milk chocolate, coarsely chopped
Note: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350~F.
Spread the hazelnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast
for 12 to 15 minutes, shaking the pan two or three times, until the
nuts are golden beneath their skins. Wrap the nuts in a clean towel
and cool completely Transfer the nuts to a large sieve and rub the
nuts back and forth to remove the loose skins. Make the cookie dough:
1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375~F.
Put three heavy, large ungreased baking sheets in the refrigerator.
2. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, process
the hazelnuts with 1 cup of the flour for 30 to 45 seconds, or until
the mixture is ground to a fine powder. Add the remaining 3/4 cup
flour, granulated sugar, confectioners' sugar and salt. Process for
10 to 15 seconds, or until the mixture is thoroughly blended. 3.
Evenly distribute the butter cubes in a circle around the chopping
blade. Add the egg and vanilla. Process for 45 to 60 seconds, or
until the mixture is creamy. (Make sure that the butter is completely
blended into the batter.) 4. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch
plain tip (such as Ateco #6) with one-fourth of the cookie dough. 5.
Remove a chilled baking sheet from the refrigerator. Starting at the
left-hand side of the midsection of the baking sheet, pipe 2-inch
logs about 1 1/2 inches apart, forming a diagonal pattern across the
center of the baking sheet. (This will enable you to pipe straight
and even lines across the baking sheet.) Continue piping until the
bottom half of the baking sheet is covered with the logs. Turn the
baking sheet 180 degrees and continue piping logs onto the other half
of the baking sheet. 6. Refrigerate the baking sheet for 10 to 15
minutes, or until the piped cookie dough is firm. Pipe the rest of
the cookie dough onto the remaining chilled baking sheets and
refrigerate. 7. Bake the cookies one baking sheet at a time for 12 to
15 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. Turn the
baking sheet halfway through baking for even browning. Using a metal
pancake spatula, immediately transfer the cookies to wire racks to
cool. Assemble tho cookies: 8. Melt the hazelnut cream-filled milk
chocolate according to the melting instructions in the Chocolate Key.
9. Using a small metal cake spatula, coat the flat side of half of
the cookies with a thin layer of melted hazelnut-cream milk
chocolate. Top each cookie with a second cookie. Place the assembled
cookies on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 5 to
10 minutes, or until the chocolate is firm. 10.Melt the milk chocolate
according to the melting instructions in the Chocolate Key OR temper
the chocolate following the tempering instructions on page 74. Scrape
the chocolate mixture into a small heatproof bowl. Place the bowl of
chocolate over a smaller bowl of warm (86~F to SS~ F) water. 11. Dip
the cookies on a diagonal halfway into the melted or tempered milk
chocolate. Place the cookies back onto the waxed paper-lined baking
sheet and refrigerate for 3 to 1O minutes, or until the chocolate is
set. Store the cookies dipped in melted chocolate in an airtight
container in the refrigerator. The cookies dipped in tempered
chocolate may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature
for up to three weeks. Source: Chocolatier magazine, January 1991
