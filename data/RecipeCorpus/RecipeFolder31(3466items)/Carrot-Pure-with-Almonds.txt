Title: Carrot Pure with Almonds
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
4 md Carrots
1 tb Butter, cut into bits
1 tb Heavy cream
Grated nutmeg
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tb Toasted almonds
Peel the carrots, trim the ends, and cut them into 2-inch lengths.
Boil them in salted water until thoroughly cooked, 35-40 minutes
depending on size and age of carrots.

Drain carrots well. Place them in a food processor or blender with the
butter, cream, nutmeg, and salt and pepper, and pure. Use your own
judgment to make a coarser or finer pure as you prefer.

Some possibilities for serving: garnish the plate directly,
sprinkling the carrot pure with the toasted almonds; serve it in a
shallow bowl, using a butter knife to make "waves: on the surface,
then garnish with the almonds; or pipe the pure from a pastry bag
onto plates, then sprinkle with the almonds.
