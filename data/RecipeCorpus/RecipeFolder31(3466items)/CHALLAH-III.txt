Title: CHALLAH III
Categories: Breads, Usenet
Yield: 4 loaves
3/4 oz Yeast (3 packages)
3/4 c  Water, water
2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter, melted
1 tb Salt
1/4 c  Honey
2 c  Raisins
8    Eggs
9 c  Flour
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
2    Egg yolks
5 ts Water
Dissolve the yeast with the warm water and sugar.  Add the rest of the
sugar, butter, salt, honey, raisins and eggs. Add the flour, a cup at
a time, until it is hard to stir.

Turn out onto a well-floured counter and knead until smooth and
blistery, adding more flour as necessary (about 10-15 minutes).  Put
into greased bowl, cover, and let rise until double, about 1 hr.

Punch down.  Separate into 4 sections and separate each section into
3 more sections. Roll each piece out to the size of your cookie
sheet. Braid 3 strands together and place on cookie sheet. Let rise
until double (about 1 hour).

Mix egg yolks and water for glaze.  Spread on loaves.  Bake in a
preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 15-30 minutes until there is a
golden crust.

NOTES:

*  Jewish egg bread -- This is my family's version of Challah.  It
calls for saffron, but I've never actually made it as such (Hey, I'm
just a poor college student, I can't afford saffron).

: Difficulty:  easy, if you know how to make bread
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 30 minutes
cooking : Precision:  Raisins are to taste.  Measure the rest of the
ingredients.
