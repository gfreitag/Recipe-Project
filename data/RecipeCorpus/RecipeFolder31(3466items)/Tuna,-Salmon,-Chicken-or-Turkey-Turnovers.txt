Title: Tuna, Salmon, Chicken or Turkey Turnovers
Categories: Fish, Poultry
Yield: 5 servings
1 c  Cooked or canned tuna,
-salmon, chicken or turkey
1 c  Shredded cheese
1/4 c  Chopped celery
1 ts Finely chopped chives, onion
-or green onion
Mayonnaise, enough to
-moisten
Salt and\or Pepper
Combine the above.
Biscuit Dough
2 c  Flour, sifted
1 tb Baking powder
1 1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Shortening or cooking oil
3/4 c  Milk
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Filling:

Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, then add the
shortening or oil and cut it in until mixture is like a coarse meal.
Add the milk all at once and stir until it forms a soft ball.  Turn
the dough out on a floured board and knead lightly 20-25 times.

Roll the dough out until it is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into 4-inch
squares or rounds and place about 2 1/2 T. filling in the center of
each. Fold each square or round over and seal (a little water to
moisten helps here).  Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake 15
minutes at 400 degrees, or until turnovers are light brown at the
edges.  Serve hot, with some of that turkey noodle soup and turkey
chef salad <grin -- actually any soup and/or salad>.   Serves 5-6
people.

Tips and Variations:

I prefer a milder cheese (such as Jack or Mozzarrella) to a
stronger-flavored cheese (such as Cheddar).  The latter tends to
overwhelm, while the former does a nice job of taking a back seat to
the other flavors present in the filling.

Otherwise, use your imagination!  Try various appropriate herbs (sage,
rosemary or tarragon go well with the poultry) in either the filling
or the dough.  1/4 cup of some other vegetable can be added (sugar
snap peas are marvelous, and mushrooms do well, too).  Try adding 1/4
t. each smoke flavoring and/or dry mustard to the dough.  And those
of you who save this recipe can take it from there; it's extremely
versatile.
