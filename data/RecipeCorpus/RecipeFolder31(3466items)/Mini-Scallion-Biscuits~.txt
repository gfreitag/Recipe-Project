*  Seasoned rice wine vinegar can be found in the Asian section of
well-stocked grocery stores.  If you are unable to find it, you can
use 2 Tbsp. white wine mixed with 1 1/2 Tbsp. sugar and 1/4 tsp. salt
instead.

Preheat oven to 425+.  Place the onions in a small bowl, add enough
cold water to cover and let sit 30 minutes; this draws out the strong
flavor of the onion.  Drain the onions well and put them back in the
bowl.  Add the vinegar and coat.  Cover and refrigerate for at least
30 minutes and up to 3 hours.

In a large bowl, sift the flour with the baking powder, salt, mustard
and black pepper.  Cut in the shortening until the mixture has the
consistency of small peas, then stir in the green onions and parsley.
Lightly stir in enough milk with a fork to make a soft dough.  Turn
the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Gently pat the dough
out to a 3/4" thickness. Sprinkle the dough with a little flour.  Cut
into 15 rounds with a 1 1/2" biscuit cutter, pressing straight down
into the dough without turning the cutter.  If you do not have a
small biscuit or cookie cutter, then cut with a knife into small
squares. Put the biscuits, sides slightly touching, on a baking
sheet.  (The biscuits can be prepared to this point then covered
tightly and refrigerated up to 4 hours before baking.) Bake until
golden and fluffy, 18-20 minutes. Let the biscuits cool for about 10
minutes. Split the biscuits in half horizontally. Spread the biscuit
bottoms with smoke salmon spread and top with a little of the pickled
onion and a dill sprig.  Arrange the biscuits on a serving platter,
replace the top halves of the biscuits slightly askew and serve
immediately.

Smoke Salmon Spread:  In a food processor, combine the cream cheese
and half of the smoked salmon and process until smooth.  Add the
horseradish and lemon juice and process, scraping down the sides as
necessary until smooth.  Add the dill and process until incorporated.
Transfer the spread to a small bowl.  Finely chop the remaining
salmon and stir it into the spread until blended. Makes 3/4 cup.
