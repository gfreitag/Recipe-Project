NOTES:

*  Frozen cranberry relish with horseradish -- Susan Stamberg, former
co-host of National Public Radio's "All Things Considered," used to
broadcast this recipe every year around Thanksgiving. She claimed it
was her mother's, but it turned out that her mother got it from a
Craig Claiborne column many years before. Very few people are neutral
about this unusual, rather strong relish, they either love it or hate
it. I'm in the former group.

*  This relish is shocking pink in color, so plan your table setting
accordingly.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight freezing.
: Precision:  measure the horseradish.
