Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. with the rack in the center
position. Have all the ingredients at room temperature.  Place the
oil, sugar, and eggs in the bread pan.  Program the macine for Dough,
Manual, Basic Dough, or Mixing.  Press start and mix for 2 minutes
(not counting any preknead cycle).  With the machine still running,
add the vanilla extract, lemon rind and lemon juice, and almonds. Mix
1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until well
blended, about 2 minutes.

Remove the dough to a lightly floured work surface.  Divide the dough
into 3 equal pieces and shape each into a 10-inch log.  Place the
logs 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25
minutes.

At the end of the baking time, remove the baking sheet from the oven
and lower the temperature to 325 degrees F.  Use a sharp knife to
slice the logs into 1/2-inch cookies and place them, cut side up, on
either the baking sheet or a lrage wire rack.  Return them to the
oven and bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until just brown and toasted.
Cool them on a rack and store in an airtight container at room
temperature.
