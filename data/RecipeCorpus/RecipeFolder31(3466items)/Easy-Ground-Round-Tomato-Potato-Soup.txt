Heat oil in a soup pot and saute onions, carrots and celery for
approximately 3-4 minutes. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, stock and
spices and cook on medium heat for 20 minutes. Add the ground round
and patotos and simmer, covered for 10 minutes.

parsley on each bowl of soup if desired

Cooks Notes: The excellent canned spiced & chopped tomatoes on the
market toady are fantastic. I prefer the Cajun Recipe tomatoes with
this soup. One cup of cooked pasta can be substituted for the potatos.

Papa Rock: A Cajun cook of some note.
