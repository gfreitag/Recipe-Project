The following recipe results in a pierogi dough that is easier to
work than most traditional recipes (it doesn't clamp itself to the
floured board nor does it snap back into a ball the minute you turn
your head.

Melt margarine and pour into mixing bowl.  Add one cup water to cool
the margarine.  Add remaining ingredients and mix and knead
thoroughly until dough is smooth and without lumps. Cover and
refrigerate at least 2 hours (or overnight). Working with a portion
of dough that is no larger than your fist, roll it out as thin as
possible on floured board. If dough becomes sticky, add small amount
of flour. Cut out 3-inch rounds with large biscuit cutter.  Put small
spoonful of filling (see below) a little to one side of each round of
dough. Moisten edge of dough with water, fold over, and press edges
of dough together firmly. Make certain that edges are well sealed.
Drop pierogi into boiling salted water and cook gently for 4 to 5
minutes (the pierogi will float when they are cooked). Do not cook
too many at a time, they tend to stick together. Lift from water with
a slotted spoon and set aside until all are cooked. Once pierogi have
all cooked, they can be reheated on the stove by sauteing them in a
generous portion of butter and onions; or they may be reheated in
oven, again with butter and onions. Serve with dollop of sour cream.
Makes about 1-1/2 dozen pierogis.

Sausage Filling Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Makes about 2
cups.
