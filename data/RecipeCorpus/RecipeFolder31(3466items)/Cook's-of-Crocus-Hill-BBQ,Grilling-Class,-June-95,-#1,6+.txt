First of all, some notes that I took;

The regular small briquettes have many harmful ingredients in them
including carcinogens. B.J. and Mary reccomend using the wood
charcoal. It is somewhat more expensive but if you smother the coals
after you use them they can be used again.

To light they recommend a chimney (gotta find one) and little
parrifin cups that you just light and tuck inside the coals or take a
sheet of newspaper and roll it from corn to cattycorner, then twist
it into a knot or prstzle type shape. place this under the charcoal
with one tip pointing up through the charcoal. Light this tip. 30
minutes preheat is needed for medium heat.

Food should be room temperature.

Mentioned a cheese called granna (sp), it does not say Parmesan but
is and comes from right outside of Parma and is virtually the same as
the Reggiano but much less expensive. For my own info: they stated
this granna can be found at a deli in Mpls. called the Gardens of
Silenica on 3rd or 4th and east Hennipen (N.E.)

Mentioned, when steaming; parsley, rosemary, and thyme stems placed
in the steaming water imparts a lovely flavor to the food.

For a pesto sauce they also mentioned that a comination of 1 part
spinach to 2 parts parsley can be nice also.

Many wonderful recipes to follow.
