Title: Brussels Sprouts with Brown Butter and Pecans
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 pt Brussels sprouts
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Pecans, coarsely chopped
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Salt and pepper to taste
Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil. Trim brussels sprouts by
cutting off the dry stem and removing any unattractive outer leaves.
Cut an X into the stem end with the tip of a knife. Boil the sprouts
for 5-10 minutes, depending on size, until cooked through. Drain.

Cut each sprout in half. Heat a 10-inch saut pan over high heat. Add
the butter. When it just starts to brown, add the sprouts, pecans,
lemon juice, salt and pepper. Toss rapidly until heated through and
serve.
