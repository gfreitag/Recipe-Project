Title: Posole 2
Categories: Tex/mexican, Soup/stew, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 lb Posole, washed well
6 c  Cold water
5 ea Medium onions, chopped
4 ea Large garlic cloves, crushed
4 tb Vegetable oil
3 lb Boned pork shoulder, cubed
1 ts Crumbled leaf oregano
1/2 ts Thyme
2 ts Salt(or to taste)
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 2/3 c  Chicken broth
10 oz Can green chile, sliced
1 ea Jalapeno, minced(see note)
Place the posole and water in a large, heavy pot; bring to a simmer,
cover and cook slowly until kernels burst and are almost tender(about
3 1/2 hours). When posole is almost done, lightly brown onions and
garlic in 2 T. oil; drain on paper towels. Add another 2 T of oil to
the skillet and brown pork cubes, a few at a time. Drain on paper
towels. Add onion, garlic, pork; add all remaining ingredients to the
posole; mix in well and simmer covered for 3 more hours. Taste for
salt and adjust as needed. Serve in large soup plates and pass a rich
red chili sauce for topping desired. Note: 1 jalapeno makes a mild
posole; 3, a very hot one. Posole is a feast day favorite among the
Pueblo Indians who live in the Rio Grande Valley. Its special flavor
and character, however, have made it year round favorite of all New
Mexicans. Hominy can be substituted for the posole if necessary.
