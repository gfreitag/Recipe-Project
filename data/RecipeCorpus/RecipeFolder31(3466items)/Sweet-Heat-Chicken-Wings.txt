Title: Sweet Heat Chicken Wings
Categories: Poultry, Hot/spicy
Yield: 1 batch
4 sl Bacon
2 tb Onion -- finely chopped
1    Clove garlic -- minced
Salt and pepper
6 oz Blue cheese -- crumbled
2/3 c  Yogurt or sour cream
1/2 c  Milk
Oil for frying
24    Chicken wings (about 4
Pounds)
4 tb Butter -- melted
1/2 c  Durkee Red Hot Sauce
1/4 c  Honey
For the dressing, cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until
barely crisp.  Remove bacon, drain, crumble and reserve.  Add the
onion to the bacon fat and cook just until onion has softened, about
30 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer the onion and bacon fat to
a mixing bowl. Stir in the garlic, salt, pepper, blue cheese, yogurt
or sour cream and milk. Mix until well blended and stir in the
crumbled bacon.  Set aside. Heat 2 to 3" of oil in a fryer or deep
heavy saucepan to 375.  Fry the wings in 2 or 3 batches without
overcrowding until golden brown and cooked through, about 8 minutes
per batch.  Drain the wings on paper towels and keep warm while you
fry the remaining wings.  While the wings are frying, combine the
butter, oil, hot sauce and honey.  Stir to mix thoroughly. Just
before serving, mix the sauce again, toss the cooked wings in 3/4 cup
of the sauce, and serve with 1 1/4 cups of the blue cheese dressing
on the side for dipping. Reserve 1 cup bacon blue cheese dressing for
Crocked Blue Cheee Potatoes and Ham.  Reserve 1/2 cup sweet hot sauce
for Stir Fried Red Hot Shrimp. Reserve 1/2 cup sweet hot sauce for
Grilled Buffalo Burgers.
