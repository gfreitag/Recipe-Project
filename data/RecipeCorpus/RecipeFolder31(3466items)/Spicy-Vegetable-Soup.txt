1 ea 2" piece ginger, grated

Using a mortar & pestle, crush the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom
pods & peppercorns.  Set aside.  In a soup pot, combine all the soup
ingredients with the crushed spices.  Bring to a boil, reduce the
heat & simmer, covered, until the vegetables are very tender, about
25 to 35 minutes. Remove from the heat & cool for 10 minutes.

In batches if necessary, puree the stock & vegetables in a blender or
food processor.  Return to a clean pot & reheat gently.

For the seasoning, warm the olive oil in a small skillet over medium
heat. When hot, put in the mustard seeds.  After a few seconds, they
should pop. Add the cumin seeds & dried red chile & remove from the
heat. Add this mixture to the soup pot.  Stir in the cilantro & salt.
Check the seasoning & serve hot.

NOTE: If you cannot find cilantro, use parsley.  Use whatever
vegetables you like.

A couple of tablespoons of nuts cooked with the vegetables adds some
creaminess to the soup.
