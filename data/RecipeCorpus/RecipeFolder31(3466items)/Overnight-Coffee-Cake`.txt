1. If baking the cake immediately, preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly
butter a 13 by 9-inch baking pan.

2. Make the cake: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, brown
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Add the
shortening. Using a hand-held electric mixer set at low speed, beat
until the mixture resembles coarse oatmeal. Add the buttermilk and
eggs and mix just until smooth. Do not overbeat. Transfer to the
baking pan and smooth evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
up to 12 hours. (The cake can also be baked immediately.)

3. Make the topping: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, pecans,
cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cover and store at room temperature until ready
to bake.

4. When ready to bake, sprinkle the top of the cake with the topping.
Preheat the oven if necessary. Bake until the cake springs back when
gently pressed in the center with a finger, 35 to 45 mins. Cool on a
wire rack. The coffee cake can be served warm or at room temperature.
