Title: Saw Mill Beef^
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
4 lb To 5 pot roast
1 lg Onion
1 c  Tomato, chopped
Salt and pepper
Put roast into a heavy skillet (with cover). Smother meat with onion
and tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add a little water.
Cover, roast 4-5 hours. Check once in a while to see if it needs
water. Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts
or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the
book, typos and all.
