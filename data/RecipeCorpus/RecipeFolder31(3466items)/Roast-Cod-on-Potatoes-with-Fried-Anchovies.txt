Preparation:

Make sure you use cod fillets with the skin on them, and potatoes
which haven't been peeled.

1. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Cook the potatoes in boiling
water until just tender, then peel. Cut into 5mm slices while still
warm, season, then add one to two tablespoons of Vierge Dressing or
Olive Oil and half the lemon juice; keep warm.

2. Melt the butter and cooking oil in a hot pan. Season the cod and
place in the pan skin side down. Cook until deep in colour; then turn
over and finish cooking in the oven for 5-8 minutes depending on the
thickness of the cod.

3. Preheat a deep-fat fryer or heat 5mm oil in a deep frying pan.
Don't let it get so hot that it smokes. Split the anchovies through
the centre. Mix the folour with the cayenne and a pinch of salt. Dip
the anchovies in the milk, then roll in flour. Deep fry until very
crispy, turning frequently if using a frying pan.

4. Warm the remaining Vierge Dressing or oil, add the capers,
shallots, a little lemon juice and the herbs, then season. The
dressing should be served warm.

5. Spoon some potatoes on to a plate, top with salad leaves, if
using, and the anchovies, the spoon the dressing round. Place the
roasted cod fillet on top, crispy skin side showing and brush with a
little butter. Submitted By KAZ LANGRIDGE   On   05-20-95
