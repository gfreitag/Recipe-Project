Title: Arugula Oil
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
Arugula stems
Olive oil to cover
Blanch the stems in boiling water for 5 seconds to set the green
color, then dunk them immediately in ice water to stop the cooking.
Roughly chop the stems and put them in a blender. Pour in enough
good-quality olive oil to cover them by an inch and blend until
smooth.

Use as is or let steep for 24 hours in the refrigerator, then strain
out the pulp. This leaves you with a more delicate, transparent oil.
Strained, it will keep for up to 10 days, while unstrained it will
only keep for a day or two.

Note; you can also make this oil with whole arugula leaves.
