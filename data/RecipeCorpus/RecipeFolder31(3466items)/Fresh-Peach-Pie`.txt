Categories: Tasteofhome, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 ts Salt
2/3 c  Crisco
1 tb Cider Vinegar
5 tb (To 7) Ice Water
Filling-----
6 lg (To 8) Peaches
1/2 c  (Or More) Sugar
3 ts Flour
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Almond Extract
2 tb Tapioca
1 tb Butter
Crust: Mix the flour, salt, and Crisco until crumbly. Gradually mix
in the vinegar and ice water. Place a paper towel on a dish towel.
Roll out the dough on the towel into 2 circles, one larger than the
other. Place the smaller circle in a 9" pie plate. Using a knife,
design the second circle as you wish, making sure to cut holes in the
center for air pockets. Filling: Peel and slice the peaches. Sprinkle
about 1/4 cup sugar on the bottom of the pie crust. Then sprinkle on
about 2 tsp of flour. Cover with the peaches. Sprinkle with 1 more
tsp flour and 3/4 cup of sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, almond extract,
and tapioca. Dot with butter. Wet edges of the dough with water and
cover with the top, decorated crust. Bake in a 350 F oven for 1 hour.

Note: Eddie Washington makes her apple pie the same way except she
also adds 1 Tbs fresh lemon juice, the peel of 1/2 lemon, and a dash
of nutmeg.
