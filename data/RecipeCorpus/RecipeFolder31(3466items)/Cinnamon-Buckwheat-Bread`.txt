Title: Cinnamon Buckwheat Bread`
Categories: Breads, Cowboy
Yield: 2 servings
2 1/2 ts Active Dry Yeast
1/2 c  Warm Water (100 - 110 F)
5 1/2 c  (Approx) Unbleached Flour,
-Preferably Bread Flour
1/2 c  Buckwheat Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Ground Cinnamon
2 ts Salt
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Nonfat Dry Milk
1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
1. In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the 1/2 cup of warm water
and let stand until creamy, about 10 mins; stir to dissolve. 2. In a
large bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour, the buckwheat flour, sugar,
cinnamon and the salt. Make a well in the center and add the 2 cups
of water, the yeast mixture, dry milk, and oil. Stir to make a thick
batter. Gradually beat in enough of the remaining flour to make a
dough that is too stiff to stir. 3. On a lightly floured surface,
knead the dough, adding more flour to make a supple dough that isn't
sticky. Continue kneading until smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 mins.
Form into a ball and place in a lightly buttered large bowl. Turn
once to coat the top of the dough with butter. Cover the bowl with
plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume,
about 1 1/2 hrs. 4. Lightly butter 2 (9 by 5-inch) loaf pans. Punch
down the dough and divide in half. Form each portion into a loaf and
place, seam side down, into the loaf pans. Cover with plastic wrap
and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 mins. 5. Preheat the oven
to 375 F. Bake until the tops are golden brown and the bottoms sound
hollow when tapped with a knuckle (remove a loaf from a pan to test,
using pot holders for protection), about 30 mins. Let cool in the
pans for 10 mins. Unmold onto a wire rack and cool completely. Makes
2 (9 by 5-inch) loaves from Clyde Nelson of The Home Ranch of Clark,
CO.
