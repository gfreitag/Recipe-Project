Categories: Fish, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Szechuan peppercorns
1/2 ts White peppercorns
1/2 ts Black peppercorns
1 ts Allspice berries
4    6 ounce
1 tb Corn oil
1/2 ts Salt
Tuna steaks
The total amount of pepper used in this recipe can be adjusted to
accomodate taste preferences, although cracked pepper used in this
way is much milder than you might imagine.

Crush peppercorns with a meat pounder or the bottom of a pan. Brush
both sides of the steaks with the oil and sprinkle both sides with
the salt and crushed pepper.

Heat a cast iron pan for 2 to 3 minutes, until very hot. Place the
steaks in the pan and cook them over very high heat for about 1+1/2
minutes on each side.  Cover the pan, remove from the heat, and let
stand for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.  The steaks will continue to
cook in their own residual heat but should remain pink inside.
