Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Olive oil
1 sm Onion, halved
-sliced lengthwise
12    Garlic clove(s), peeled
4 lg Boiling potatoes, peeled

Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Parsley, coarsely chopped
In a 12-inch skillet, heat 1 tbs of the olive oil over medium heat.
Add the onion and garlic cloves and saut about 5 minutes or until the
onions are slightly browned.

Add th potatoes and the wine. Raise the heat to high and cook until
the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.

Add the stock, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then lower the
heat to a simmer and cook for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.

While the ragout is simmering, trim the tough parts of the mushroom
stems and clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth. Cut them into large
pieces.

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the remaining 2 tbs of olive oil over
medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for
about 15 minutes, until they have softened and their juice has
evaporated.

Add the mushrooms to the potato ragout and simmer together for about
20 minutes.

Season the ragout with salt and pepper. Just before serving, remove
the bay leaf and stir in the parsley.

Note: The ragout reheats well, but you might need to add a little
stock or water.
