Title: Cranberry Compote with Red Wine and Sweet Spices
Categories: Side dish, Fruit
Yield: 2 cups
1    Bag cranberries
3 tb Sugar
1 1/3 c  Full-bodied red wine
1/16 ts Ground cloves
1/16 ts Ground ginger
Grated nutmeg
Freshly ground black pepper
1    Cinnamon stick
1    1" strip lemon zest
Look over cranberries and discard any that are white or withered.
Place remaining cranberries in a heavy-bottomed, nonreactive 2-quart
saucepan.

Add the sugar, red wine, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, black pepper,
cinnamon stick, and lemon zest. Stir to combine and place the pot
over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring often, then lower the
heat to keep them at a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring often and
mashing a bit, until the berries have broken out of their skins and
the mixture has become a thick chunky sauce, about 45 minutes.
Discard the cinnamon stick.

Taste the sauce, add more sugar if desired. Serve immediately or let
cool and serve at room temperature.
