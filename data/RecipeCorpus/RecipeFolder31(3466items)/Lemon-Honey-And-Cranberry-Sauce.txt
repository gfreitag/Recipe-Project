Title: Lemon-Honey And Cranberry Sauce
Categories: Tasteofhome, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 servings
1 lb Cranberries
1    Inch Spring Water
1 c  Lemon Honey -- or to taste
In a small casserole, simmer the cranberries in 1" of spring water
until they burst. Add lemon honey to taste. Cool before serving.
Alternatively, you can merely grind the raw cranberries with the
lemon honey in a food processor or blender. A suggestion is to
substitute orange juice instead of the water. Then you can cut down
on the amount of honey used. Great for Thanksgiving. Makes 2 cups.
