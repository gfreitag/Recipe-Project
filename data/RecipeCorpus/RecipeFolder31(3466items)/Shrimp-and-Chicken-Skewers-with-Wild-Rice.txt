1. Combine jalapeno, minced shallot, parsley, lemon rind, and half of
the garlic to make a fine paste.  Place in a bowl with the shrimp and
chicken and lemon juice.  Toss to coat.  Marinate, covered, for at
least 1 hour. 2. Heat the oil in a 2 quart pot.  Add the sliced
scallion, remaining garlic, chili pepper, basil and mint.  Cook for 2
minutes.  Add the tomatoes, cover the pot, and cook for 10 minutes.
Keep warm. 3. Heat a broiler or grill to hot. 4. Wrap a strip of
chicken around the outside of a shrimp. Stick a skewer through them
both so both are secure.  Wrap the remaining chicken and shrimp the
same way, putting 3 wrapped shrimp on each of 4 skewers. Grill or
broil for 2 minutes a side.  Slide chicken and shrimp onto plates,
and serve with wild rice and stewed tomatoes. WILD RICE: 5. Heat the
oil in a 2 quart pot.  Add the onion, celery, garlic and pepper. Cook
for 2 minutes, until lightly browned and soft. 6. Add the rice, bay
leaf, pine nuts and stock.  Bring to a boil, cover, and lower the
heat so the liquid simmers.  Continue cooking for 55 minutes. Uncover
and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed. Discard the bay leaf.
