Title: Quick Meal--Pasta Susanna
Categories: Pasta, Fatfree, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Cooked pasta (I like
Rotini)
1 ea Chopped vegetables (i.e.
Mushrooms, Bell Peppers,
Broccoli, Zucchini/Summer
Squash)
1 ea Spinach
1 ea Onions
1 ea Garlic
1 ea Veggie broth
1 cn Diced tomatoes and broth
In large non-stick skillet, saute onions & mushrooms & garlic.  After
a while, add spinach if frozen.  Wait until spinach thaws, then add
your other veggies.  You may want to add some veggie broth. Before
they're quite done, add 1 can (more if you like tomatoes, or if
you're feeding lots (3 or more) people) of diced tomatoes with their
sauce. Stir until tomatoes start to warm up, then add the cooked
pasta.  Stir all together. Spice as desired.  (Basil, oregano, and
dill is good.) Don't forget freshly ground pepper.

This is quick, although it does use two pans.  It really impressed my
roommate the first time I made it.  I like it because I can use lots
of veggies, and it isn't terribly tomatoey.  It's so much lighter
than pouring regular tomato sauce on your pasta.

Source: I must confess, I adapted this recipe from my aunt, who used
olive *il and barely any veggies. That's why I call it Pasta Susanna
instead of Pasta Donna.  :)
