Title: Das U-238 Punch
Categories: Beverages, Fruit
Yield: 12 drunks
1 qt Dark Navy Rum
1 qt Vodka
1 pt Light Rum
1 qt Strawberry juice
1 qt Orange juice
1 qt Pineapple juice
1 pt Fresh strawberries
1 pt Orange wedges
1 pt Pineapple chunks
Mix all ingredients well. Cover and chill for 24 hours.. Serve as you
would punch.

This beverage's motto is: Hiroshima's favorite since '45. Guaranteed
to bomb you into the next decade!

NOTE: Orange juice and wedges and pineapple juice and chunks can be
substituted for your favorite fruit. However, the strawberries and
juice is considered MANDATORY! The vodka can also be substituted for
your favorite booze, but rum is MANDATORY!

The general rule of thumb for this recipe is: two quarts of booze
(one of which MUST be rum), and three quarts of fruit juice including
1 pint of accompanying FRESH fruit (one of the fruits MUST be
strawberries)
