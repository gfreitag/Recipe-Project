Title: Irish Stew (2) [Biddy Whyte Lennon]
Categories: Main dish, Soup/stew, Meats, Irish, Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb or mutton
2 lg Onions
3 lb Potatoes
lg Bunch fresh parsley
2 ts Chopped fresh thyme
Water
Salt and fresh black pepper
Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as
thinly as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large. Cut
the meat into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole,
larger ones divided in two. Place a layer of onions on the bottom of
a heavy casserole, and the meat on top of them. Sprinkle chopped
thyme and parsley generously, and season well. Layer the rest of the
onions with the potatoes. Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the
last.  The amount of water you need to add depends on how good the
seal is between your pot and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or
"dry" stew.  You will certainly not need more than two cups, and I
use barely one. Bring the water to a boil, cover as tightly as
possible, and place in a preheated oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours.
Keep an eye on it towards the end, and adjust the gravy by adding a
little water if you think it too dry.  A good stew should have some
gravy, but should not be flooded by it.  "Floury" potatoes will
dissolve into the gravy, "waxy" ones will not.  I tend to use a
mixture. Serve very hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled on
top. White soda bread to mop up the gravy.
