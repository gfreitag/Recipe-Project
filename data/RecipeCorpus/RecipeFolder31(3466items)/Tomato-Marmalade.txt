Title: Tomato Marmalade
Categories: Vegetables, Can/preserv
Yield: 64 servings
4 lb Red ripe tomatoes
2    Oranges
1    Lemon
12    Cloves
1    3-inch cinnamon stick
4 lb Sugar
1/3 c  Candied ginger root --
-chopped
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
Peel, seed, and chop tomatoes, reserving juice. Wash lemon and oranges
well, seed and chop, but do not peel. Break up cinnamon stick into 2-3
pieces and tie in a cheesecloth bag with cloves and allspice. Combine
tomatoes, oranges, and lemon in a large, heavy duty kettle. Stir over
medium high heat until sugar dissolves. Add cheesecloth bag of spices
and bring to a boil. Turn heat to low and continue to boil until
mixture thickens (about 1 hour). Remove cheesecloth bag, add lemon
juice and ginger, bring to a boil again, and cook 10 minutes more.
Pour into hot

sterilized jars, and seal according to manufacturer's instructions.
Makes 3-4 pints.

NOTES : This marmalade has a wonderful texture and very spicy-sweet
flavor. Pinwheel tea sandwiches can be made by slicing a loaf of fine
grained white bread length wise into thin slices, spreading softened
cream cheese on the bread, followed with Tomato Marmalade. Roll the
slice up from the short end, wrap in wax paper, and chill at least 2
hours. To serve, cut into slices crosswise, as a jelly roll.
