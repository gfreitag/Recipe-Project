Categories: Irish, British isl, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/4 lb Unsmoked bacon
1 md Onion
2    Carrots
2    Celery sticks
1    Bay leaf
4 c  Chicken stock
5/8 c  Double cream

Preparation:

Remove the rind from the bacon and roll the bacon. Roughly chop the
onion, carrots and celery sticks. Make the chicken stock.

1. Soak the bacon in water for 24 hours prior to cooking to reduce
salt
content. Rinse well.

2. Place the bacon in a pan with the vegetables and bay leaf. Cover
with
the stock or water. Bring to the simmer and continue simmering for
1-1.5 hours. Rest the bacon in the stock for 20-30 minutes.

3. Drain off 600ml of stock and bring to the boil and reduce by half
and
serve with the bacon. Alternatively, add the cream, if using, to
the
reduced stock and cook for 10 minutes, then whisk in 25g of butter
at a
time, to taste. Add the mustard seeds, season and keep warm.

5. Add the bacon, allowing 2 slices per person.
