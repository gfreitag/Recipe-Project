Title: Pierogi Dough #2
Categories: Appetizers, Polish, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Flour -- all purpose
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
Mound flour on kneading board and make a hole in the center. Drop
eggs into hole and cut into flour with knife. Add salt and water and
knead dough until firm. Let rest for 10 minutes covered with a warm
bowl. Divide dough in halves and roll thin. Cut circles with a large
biscuit cutter. Place a spoonfull of filling a little to one side of
center on each round of dough. Moisten edge with water, fold over and
press edges together firmly. Be sure they are well sealed to prevent
the filling from running out. Drop pierogi into boiling water. Cook
gently for 3 to 5 minutes. Lift out of water with perforated spoon.
The dough has a tendency to dry while you are working. A dry dough
will not seal completely. We suggest rolling out a large circle of
dough, placing small mounds of filling far enough apart to allow for
cutting, and folding the dough over the mounds of filling. Then cut
with the biscuit cutter and seal firmly. ( No servings amount was
given. The 1 means one batch of dough. )
