Title: Perfect Fish Balls^
Categories: Fish, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Potatoes, chopped fine
1 c  Cod, flaked
1 tb Butter
Pepper to taste
1    Egg, beaten
Plenty of lard, smoking hot
Fried Bacon, optional
Cook Fish and potatoes till tender. Mash very thoroughly until every
lump is gone. Add butter, pepper and egg and beat till the whole is
light and creamy. Take up, a little at a time, with a spoon dipped in
hot fat (prevents sticking) and drop into hot lard. Cook til golden
brown. If the lard is the right heat this will not take more than a
minute. Drain well and serve with crispy fried bacon. (Or without it).

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
