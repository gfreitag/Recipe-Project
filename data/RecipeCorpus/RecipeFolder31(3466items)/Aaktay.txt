Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-------------------KLINGON STEAMED BREAD------------------------
1 c  White cornmeal
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  All-bran cereal
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ginger
3/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
1/2 c  Dates, chopped
2/3 c  Powdered skim milk
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 ea Orange; unpeeled
1 c  Rhubarb; chopped
Margarine; to grease cans
2 ea 37 oz empty cans
Mix together in a bowl all the dry ingredients including dates and
walnuts (leave out only the buttermilk, honey, orange half and
rhubarb). Put the buttermilk and the honey in the blender. Wash an
orange, cut off any price or brand marks and cut it in half. Cut the
orange half into chunks and add it to the blender, being sure that
you have removed all the seeds. Run the blender until the orange
chunks are chopped into little bits. Now add the buttermilk mixture,
along with the rhubarb chunks, to the dry ingredients and mix well.
Pour immediately into greased cans, filling each can no more than
two-thirds full. Cover the filled cans with aluminum foil, and secure
the foil with a rubber bands. Place them in a large pot, on some kind
of a rack so they are not touching the bottom of the pot. Pour in hot
water until the bottom 2 inches of the cans are covered. Bring to a
boil and keep the water boiling gently for about 1 1/2 hours. The pot
should be covered and there should be a little steam escaping at all
times. Check the pot occasionally to make sure that there is enough
water left. At the end of 1 1/2 hours, check with a skewer, right
through the foil. If it does not come out clean, cook for another
half hour and recheck. When the loaves are done, take the "hot" cans
out of the pot. When you are ready to serve, uncover a mold, shake
the loaf out onto a breadboard and slice it. Serve warm with butter
or cream cheese. FROM: JOANNE FERRY (CMSJ69B)
