Title: Fig And Raisin 'cream'
Categories: Fruit, Medieval, Alcohol
Yield: 6 servings
4 oz Well-soaked dried
-figs
4 oz Stoned raisins
1 1/4 c  Red wine (not too dry)
Good pinch of ground black
-pepper
1/3 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground cloves
Soft dark brown sugar to
-taste
3 ts Rice flour or cornflour
-drop or two of red food
Colouring
Salt to taste
Drain the figs, reserving the soaking liquid.  Discard the stalk ends
of the fruit and put them in a saucepan with the raisins and wine.
Add the spices and a teaspoon of sugar and bring to the boil.  Take
off the heat and cool slightly, then turn the mixture into an
electric blender and process until smooth.  Add a little of the
soaking water if the mixture is stubbornly solid.

Cream the rice flour or cornflour with a little more soaking water or
wine and brighten the tint with a drop of food colouring.  Blend the
'cream' into the dried-fruit puree.  Then return the whole mixture to
the saucepan and simmer until it thickens slightly.  Season with salt
and a little extra sugar if you wish.

The mixture can be served hot or cold over a sweet cereal dish, firm
stewed fruit or - best of all- ice cream.  Some versions in other
manuscripts are stiffer and make a good filling for tartlets or fried
puffs. One encloses the filling in pastry to make dumplings.
