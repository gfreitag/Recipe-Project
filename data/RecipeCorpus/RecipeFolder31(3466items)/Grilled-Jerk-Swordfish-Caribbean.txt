Title: Grilled Jerk Swordfish Caribbean
Categories: Fish, Seafood, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/3 lb Swordfish steaks
4 tb Jerk marinade
8 oz Can pineapple tidbits,
-drained, reserve juice
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 c  Long-grain white rice
1 sm Red bell pepper -- core,
-seed, dice
6    Whole allspice berries --
(optional)
2    Green onions -- chopped
1    Lime -- cut in wedges
Rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Brush
both sides with marinade and lay on a plate (or on a broiler rack or
baking sheet, if broiling); set aside. Preheat a charcoal grill or
broiler. Add enough chicken broth to the reserved pineapple juice to
measure 2 cups. Stir the broth mixture, pineapple, rice, bell pepper
and allspice together in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over
high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the liquid
is absorbed, 18-20 minutes (or cook in a rice steamer). Take from the
heat and let stand until ready to serve; discard the allspice berries.

When the rice has cooked 12-15 minutes, place fish on a lightly oiled
grill and cook 3 minutes.  Turn over and cook until the fish is just
barely opaque but still moist in the center (or broil, without
turning, for 6-8 minutes).  Fluff the rice with a fork, stir in the
green onions and spoon onto individual plates.  Transfer the
swordfish to plates and garnish with lime wedges.

Note:  Bottled jerk sauce instantly turns ordinary fish into a spicy
Caribbean treat.
