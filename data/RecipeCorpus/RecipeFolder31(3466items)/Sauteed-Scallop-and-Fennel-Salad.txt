Title: Sauteed Scallop and Fennel Salad
Categories: Seafood, British isl
Yield: 4 servings
4    Fennel Bulbs
1    Lemon Juice
1    Star Anise
1 3/4 oz Unsalted Butter
1 tb Olive Oil
12    Scallops
Salt
White Pepper
Green Salad Leaves
Vinaigrette
1 tb Chives
Preparation:

Trim the scallops and remove the roes.

1. Top and tail the fennel, then using a small knife remove the core
from the base of each bulb. Place 900ml of water in a pan with the
lemon juice, a pinch of salt and the star anise then bring to the
boil. Add the fennel, cover and simmer over a medium heat for 15-20
minutes or until just tender.

2. Remove the fennel and star anise with a slotted spoon. Pour off
half the cooking liquid and boil it to reduce to about 150ml. This
will increase the fennel flavour. Add the butter gradually to the
liquid, whisking vigorously between each addition, to make a butter
sauce. For a lighter and smoother sauce, use an electric hand
blender. Keep warm.

3. Slice the fennel 5mm thick lengthways. Heat a frying pan and add
one tsp of olive oil. Fry the slices on both sides until golden,
season and place on a serving plate; keep warm.

4. Add the remaining oil to the pan and heat well, then add the
scallops. Once coloured and seasoned on both sides, they are ready;
this should only take 2-3 minutes depending on size. Remove from the
pan and place on top of the fennel. Arrange the salad leaves in the
centre of the scallops. Str the chives into the sauce and spoon
around. Submitted By KAZ LANGRIDGE   On   05-20-95
