Title: Garlic Flavored Oil-Cold Infusion Method
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 3 /4 cup
1    Head garlic
-separated into cloves
-and peeled
-(1/3 cup finely chopped)
1/2 c  Distilled white vinegar
1 c  Olive oil
Choose unblemished garlic without cracks or soft spots. Soak cloves in
vinegar for 15 minutes, drain, and rinse under cold, running water.
Drain, dry well, then out in blender with oil and pulse until
chopped. Do not blend to a pure or the oil and garlic will be too
difficult to separate.

Strain pure immediately through a fine-mesh strainer such as a china
cap. Strain again through 4 layers of cheesecloth and put in a
sterilized glass bottle. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Use within 1
week for optimum flavor.
