Categories: Meats, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Mutton shoulder
1 c  Bread crumbs
1 tb Parsley, chopped
1/2    Lemon, grated rind of
1 tb Fat
Salt and pepper
1    Egg, beaten well
Remove the blade bone from the shoulder, or have the butcher do it.
Mix together the crumbs, parsley, lemon rind, fat, salt, pepper and
egg. Stuff the boned cavity, sew up the opening and roast. Be sure to
baste frequently with a little fat or the meat will be dry. Allow 15
minutes to the pound. Serve with gravy. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
