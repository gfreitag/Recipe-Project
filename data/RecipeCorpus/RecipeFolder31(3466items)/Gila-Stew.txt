Do NOT skin him/her, or s/he will become angry

Place Gila Monster into a very heavy iron pot.  Very quickly add the
butter, truffles, Brie, and Chablis.  Place a close-fitting lid on
the pot. cook over mesquite charcoal for one hour.  Carefully lift
the lid. The Gila Monster may look done, but don't believe him.  He
has drunk the Chablis and is sublimely happy as the heated pot ALMOST
equals the heat of his natural habitat:  The Arizona Desert.

On second thought, set the Gila Monster free and treat yourself to
the Brie and Chablis!
