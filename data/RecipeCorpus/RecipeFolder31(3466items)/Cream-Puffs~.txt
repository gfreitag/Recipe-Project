1/8 tsp. salt. Stir in milk. Cook and stir till bubbly. Cook and stir
2 minutes more. Remove from heat.

Gradually stir 1 cup of the hot mixture into the beaten egg. Return
all to saucepan; cook and stir 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Stir
in vanilla and food coloring, if desired. Pour into a bowl; cover
surface with clear plastic wrap. Chill.

To serve, fill cream puffs with pudding and strawberries. Serves 12.
