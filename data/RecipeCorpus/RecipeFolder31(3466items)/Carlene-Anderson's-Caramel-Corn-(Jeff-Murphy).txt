Title: Carlene Anderson's Caramel Corn (Jeff Murphy)
Categories: Candies, Kids, Snacks
Yield: 1 servings
4 ea Qts popped corn
1 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Water
1 tb Vanilla
Mix butter, sugar, water,and vanilla with wooden spoon over high heat,
stirring constantly for 4-5 minutes, until mixture comes to a boil and
faint brown streaks appear.  There will also be a smoky smell. Pour
over four quarts popped corn a little at a time, layering and mixing
sauce and corn. Don't do it in the rain, or at higher altitudes.
Apparently this makes the caramel sauce turn grainy after cooling.
