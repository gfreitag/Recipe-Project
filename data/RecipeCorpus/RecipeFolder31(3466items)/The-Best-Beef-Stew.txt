Categories: Meats, Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Butter
1 tb Olive Oil
2 c  Onions
1 1/4 lb Stew meat
1/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
12 oz Beer
28 oz Tomatoes, canned -- cut up
1/4 ts Oregano
1 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Salt
3    Potatoes -- cubed
3    Carrots -- sliced thick
1/4    Turnip -- cubed (optional)

Onions should be cut in thin wedges for 5 cups. Use boneless
short-rib, blade or rump roast cut into 1 inch cubes.

In large ovenproof casserole with lid or Dutch oven, heat half the
butter and oil over medium heat.  Cook onions until beginning to
brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low. cook 7 to 10 minutes or
until very tender and golden.  Remove onions. Set aside. Wipe
casserole.

Lightly coat meat in flour, shaking off excess.  Heat remaining
butter and oil in casserole over medium-high heat. Add meat in
batches (pieces should not touch) and brown well on all sides. Add to
onions. Pour off any fat in casserole.  Add beer, bring to boil
stirring to scrape up brown bits from bottom.  Simmer beer over
medium heat until it reduces by one-third, about 3 minutes. Return
onions and beef to casserole along with tomatoes and their juices,
oregano, thyme and salt. Cover tightly (put foil over pan before
placing lid on to keep it tight). Cook in preheated 325 F oven 1
hour.  Add diced potatoes, turnip (if using) and sliced carrots. Cook
for 1 hour or until meat and veggies are fork tender.

Optional. Heat olive oil in heavy skillet. Add mushrooms. Cook over
medium-ghigh heat about 5 minutes, turning at intervals, until nicely
browned.  Add to stew. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Garnish
with parsley. Makes 4
