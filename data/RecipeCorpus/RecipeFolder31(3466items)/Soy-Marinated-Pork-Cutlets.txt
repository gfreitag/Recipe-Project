Title: Soy-Marinated Pork Cutlets
Categories: Meats, Asian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Ginger root; peeled & grated
1 cl Garlic; crushed
1 ts Sesame oil; dark or toasted
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 lb Pork loin cutlets
Combine the soy sauce, ginger root, garlic and oils in a pie plate.
Add the pork and turn to coat.  Marinate at room temperature about 30
minutes or refrigerate (overnight) and marinate until ready to cook.

To cook the pork: Heat a large non-stick skillet over high heat until
hot enough to sizzle 1 drop of water upon contact. Add the pork and
cook until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Cover
pan for 1 minute. Remove the pork to a side dish.  Do not overcook.

When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut into thin diagonal
slices. Use either for stir-fry or salad topping.
