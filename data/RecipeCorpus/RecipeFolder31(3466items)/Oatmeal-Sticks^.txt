Categories: Breads, Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Shortening
1 1/4 c  Milk, scalded
1/2 c  Oatmeal or rolled oats
4 ts Baking powder
Sift together flour, salt, sugar and baking powder; rub in the
shortening. Pour the hot milk over the oatmeal; cook, mix with other
ingredients, working with your hands until dough is smooth. Roll into
sticks about the length and thickness of a lead pencil. Bake about 10
minutes in a rather hot oven, about 400 degrees.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
