Title: Lukshen (Noodles)
Categories: Jewish, Pasta
Yield: 1 servings
1    Egg
2/3 c  Flour
Pinch of salt
Mix ingredients and knead until dough is soft and elastic.  Roll out
on a floured board to a thin even sheet.  Let this dry until it is no
longer stickky, but not so dry that it wil lbe brittle.  Fold into a
flat, narrow roll about 2 inches wide, and with a sharp knife, cut
crosswise into very fine strips and toss them up lightly to separate
them. Spread on a board or cloth to dry thoroughly before storing in
jars. For broad noodles cut in strips 3/8 or 1/2 inch wide, separate
and dry.

To prepare noodles, boil until tender in salted water.  Drain and add
to soup.  Or the noodles may be cooked for 15 to 20 minutes directly
in the soup if preferred.
