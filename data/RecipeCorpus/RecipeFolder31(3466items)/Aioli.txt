Categories: French, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings

Pressed
2    Egg yolks -- room
Temperature
1 ts Water
1/4 ts Salt
1 pn Freshly ground pepper
1 c  Olive oil
In mixing bowl, combine garlic, yolks, water, salt, and pepper.  Very
gradually, add oil, beating constantly until mixture thickens.  Keep

boiled fish and vegetables served with a garlic mayonnaise. All
white-meated fish may be used.  In Provence, no aioli is considered
complete if it does not include boiled snails (without shells). In
the northern part of France, "aioli" has taken the meaning of garlic
mayonnaise only, and is served much as plain mayonnaise, with cold
fish, meat, or vegetables. Recipe Source: THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING
