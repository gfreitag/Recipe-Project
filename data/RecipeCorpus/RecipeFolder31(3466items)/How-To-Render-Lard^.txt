Grind pork fat or chop into small pieces. Put into a large roasting
pan and bake most of the day in a slow oven. Squash fat occasionally
with a potato masher. Let it cool a bit. CAREFULLY strain through
cheesecloth and then pour fat into jars. cover and store in a cool
place or better yet in the icebox. Save the browned cracklings and
use for flavoring as you would bacon.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
