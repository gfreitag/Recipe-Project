Title: Masa z Liskovykh Orikhiv (Filbert Filling)
Categories: Desserts, Holiday, Russian
Yield: 10 servings
6 oz Filberts Or Walnuts
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla Extract
3 ts Sour Cream
Seedless Berry Or Grape Jam
Roast the nuts in a heavy skillet, rub lightly to remove some of the
skin, and grate fine in a processor or a nut grinder.  Mix in the
sugar, vanilla, and enough sour cream (you might need up to 4 ts) to
bind.  Split the cake into two layers and spread one cut surface with
jam then the nut filling. Cover the filling with the other layer and
press lightly.  Wrap in foil and refrigerate overnight.  Glaze with
chocolate icing or cover lightly with the same type of jam used
inside and sprinkle with chocolate shavings.

NOTE:

This filling is especially good with Medianyk (Honey Cake).
