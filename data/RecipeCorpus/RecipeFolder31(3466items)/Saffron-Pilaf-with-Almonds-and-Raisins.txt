Categories: Rice, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Butter
1/2 c  Onions, diced
2 c  Uncooked white rice
3 c  Chicken stock
1 ts Saffron
1/2 c  Raisins or currants
1/2 c  Almonds, sliced
Salt to taste
1 tb Parsley, chopped
Preheat oven to 350F.

Melt butter in an ovenproof casserole over medium-low heat. Add onion
and sweat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Lower the heat if it starts to brown.

Add rice and cook, stirring, until it turns opaque, about 2 minutes.
Don't burn the rice.

Add chicken stock and saffron and stir well. Raise heat to high and
bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, cover, and
place in oven for 10 minutes.

Add the raisins or currants to the rice with stirring, cover again,
and continue baking for another 10 minutes or until all the liquid is
absorbed. Uncover the rice, stir in half the almonds with a bit of
salt, then sprinkle the remaining almonds on top. Garnish with
chopped parsley and serve.
