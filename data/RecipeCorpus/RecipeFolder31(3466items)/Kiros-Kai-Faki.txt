MMMMM-----------------KLINGON PIGS FEET AND PEAS----------------------
-Soup
2 1/2 lb Fresh pigs feet
-or pork hocks
-salt
1 lb Yellow split peas
1 ea Onion; chopped
2 qt Water
-butter
The night before you plan to make this soup, soak the feet or hocks in
brine (1 tablespoon of salt per quart of water). They should be
completely covered. Put the split peas to soak in plain cool water.
There should be about 2 inches of water over the peas++they will
swell quite a bit. The meat should be put in the refrigeratior
overnight; the peas may be, too, but it is less important. In the
morning, take the meat out of the brine, put it in a 8 qt. pot, add
the peas, onion and 2 quarts of fresh water. Bring to a boil. Skim
off any foam that comes to the top, then reduce the heat and simmer
for about 6 or more hours, stirring occasionally so the peas do not
stick to the bottom of the pot. The meat should be fallng off the
bones, and the soup should be quite thick and fairly smooth. Take the
meat and bones out of the soup and cool slightly. Take the meat off
the bones and cut into smaller pieces. Put the meat back into the
soup and reheat if necessary. Serve with a small pat of butter in the
center of each bowl. FROM: JOANNE FERRY (CMSJ69B)
