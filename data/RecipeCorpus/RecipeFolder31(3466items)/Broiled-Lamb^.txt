Categories: Meats, Main dish, Tasteofhome, Depress/era
Yield: 1 servings
sl Cold lamb, roasted or
Boiled
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Lemon juice
Salt and pepper
Currant jelly
Cut slices of lamb about 1/2" thick from a part of the joint that's
not too well cooked. Mix oil and lemon, pour over meat and let stand
an hour (lemon makes the meat tender). Place in a broiling pan and
cook about 4 minutes. Season highly and serve with currant jelly.
Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or
oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book,
typos and all.
