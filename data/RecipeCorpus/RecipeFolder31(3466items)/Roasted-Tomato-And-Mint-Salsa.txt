Title: Roasted Tomato And Mint Salsa
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 3 servings
6 lg Roma tomatoes -- tops
Removed
1    Clove garlic
2 tb Lime juice -- one Mexican
Lime
3 tb Olive oil -- extra virgin
2    Serrano peppers -- minced,
With seeds
1 1/2 tb Cilantro -- minced
3 1/2 tb Spearmint -- minced
1/2 ts Lime zest
1/2 ts Orange zest
1 pn Salt
With a comal or black iron skillet over medium-high heat, cook the
tomatoes until blackened all over. While still warm, pulse tomatoes
with the garlic in a food processor until roughly chopped. Let cool
to room temperature and add the remaining ingredients. Mix together
and let sit at least 30 minutes before using.

Mark Miller writes: "Ripe red tomatoes roasted on a hot steel comal
until the skins blacken are a basic element of many Mexican salsas.
The smoky flavor adds a complexity to the taste of ripe tomatoes.
Mixing fresh mint as a counterpoint to this cooked flavor creates the
combination of raw and cooked which is one of the classic taste
motifs of Southwestern cuisine. This salsa goes particularly well
with the wild Churro lamb that we serve at Coyote Cafe because it
does not mask the Churro's unique taste. It can be served with
venison chops, grilled pork, grilled marlin, and that faithful
standby, tortilla chips."
