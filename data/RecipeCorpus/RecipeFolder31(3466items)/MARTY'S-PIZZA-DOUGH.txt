Title: MARTY'S PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Breads, Main dish, Italian
Yield: 2 pies
4 1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Water, lukewarm (105 to 115
Degrees Fahrenheit)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Olive oil
Put flour into a large bowl and make a deep well in the middle. Pour
warm water into the well, mix in the yeast, using a bit of flour in
the mix. Add the sugar, salt, and flour to the well, let stand for 10
minutes until mixture bubbles. Slowly stir all of the flour into the
yeast mixture. When it gets too thick to handle place it on a board
and knead it until elastic. Form a ball, place into a greased bowl,
then turn it over so the top of the ball is greased. Cover with a
towel and let rise in a warm and draft free place for an hour or
until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch down dough
and divide in half. Refrigerate one half for later. (Allow extra time
to rise). Roll the other half into a circle about 15 inches across.
Place on a 14 inch greased pizza pan, roll edges to form a rim.

Spread half the sauce on the pizza pie (see recipe), top with shredded
mozzarella, and other favorite toppings (mushrooms, olives, pepperoni,
etc). Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until edges are brown and cheese is
bubbly. Cut each pie into 6 wedges.
