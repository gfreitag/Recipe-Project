Title: Friendship Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 pt Friendship Cake Starter
16 oz Lite peaches -- sliced
20 oz Pineapple tidbits
3    6 oz jars Maraschino
Cherries -- drained
7 1/2 c  Sugar
2 pk Golden Butter Cake Mix
2 pk Instant Vanilla Pudding Mix
8    Eggs
1 1/3 c  Oil
2 c  Raisins -- optional
2 c  Walnuts -- optional
2 c  Pecans -- optional
2 c  Coconut -- optional
Day 1.  Pour starter into glass gallon jar.  Add can of sliced
peaches with the juice; cut each slice into 4 pieces.  Add 2 1/2 cups
sugar. Stir. Cover jar loosely and keep at room temperature. Stir
every day for 10 days. All the sugar may not dissolve for several
days.  Don't cover airtight.

Day 10.  Add can of pineapple tidbits with juice and 2 1/2 cups sugar.
Stir.  Continue as before, stirring every day for 10 more days. Your
starter has changed color and your fruit will foam when stirred.

Day 20. Add 3 6-oz jars of maraschino cherries, drained. Cut each
cherry in half.  Add 2 1/2 cups sugar.  Stir.  Continue stirring
daily for 10 days.

These are the last ten days.  The cherries will give the juice its
pinkish color back. Day 31.  You will now bake your cakes.  Preheat
oven to 300~. Grease and flour your pans.  Drain fruit into a large
bowl. Pour juice into 3 pint jars.  Into a large bowl put 1 box cake
mix, 1 box instant vanilla pudding mix, 4 eggs, 2/3 cup oil and 1/2
the drained fruit. Mix with a spoon only until well mixed. Then stir
in 1 cup each of raisins, walnuts, pecans and coconut. Pour into
prepared pans.  Bake until straw inserted in center comes out clean.

Makes 2 tube pans or 12 one pound loaves or 4 loaves, 9 1/2x5
1/2x3-inch. Bake one tube pan at a time for approximately 60-90
minutes.  Bake large loaves for 60-90 minutes or until a straw
inserted in center comes out clean.

Comments.  MUST put in a gallon GLASS jar.  Use fruit in juices NOT
syrup. The three pint jars of juice are the starters, one for you and
two for your friends.  Never refrigerate the starter! Day one must
start within 3 or 4 days after the fruit has been drained.
