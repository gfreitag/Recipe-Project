Sylvia's comments: I added the sour cream and taco seasoning to what
had been plain beans because I liked it in another recipe.  This is a
FAST something-to-take-to-a-party.  It's too much to fit in a pie
place, I used a glass casserole and it was almost too much for that.
I wasn't wild about the combination of flavors, though.  Maybe this
is something I only like when someone else makes it.  ;)
