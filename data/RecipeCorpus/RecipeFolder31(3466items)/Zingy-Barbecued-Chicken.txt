Title: Zingy Barbecued Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Grapefruit juice
1/2 c  Apple cider vinegar
1/2 c  Oil
1/4 c  Chopped onion
1    Egg
1/2 ts Celery salt
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1/8 ts Pepper
3 lb Chicken pieces
In blender container, place all ingredients except chicken; blend 30
seconds.  In small saucepan, pour blended sauce mixture and heat
about 5 minutes, until slightly thickened.  Remove from heat; dip
chicken in sauce, one piece at a time, turning to thoroughly coat.
Reserve sauce.

Place chicken on prepared grill, skin-side up, about 8" from heat.
Grill, turning every 10 minutes, for about 50 minutes or until
chicken is tender and juices run clear.  Brush generously with
reserved sauce during last 20 minutes of grilling.  Watch chicken
carefully because the egg and sauce can cause the chicken to brown
too quickly.

Serves:  4
