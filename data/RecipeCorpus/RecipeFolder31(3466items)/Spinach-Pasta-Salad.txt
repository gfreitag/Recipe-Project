Title: Spinach Pasta Salad
Categories: Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
8 oz Spinach noodles
1 c  Cauliflower, steamed until
-just tender
1 c  Sliced mushrooms
1/2 c  Italian Dressing (I'm
-partial to Wishbone or
-Good Seasons)
1 c  Cooked ham, thinly sliced &
-cut into narrow strips
1/2 c  Grated parmesan cheese
Cook the noodles just until tender; drain.  In a large bowl, combine
cauliflower, mushrooms, and dressing.  Add the warm noodles & ham;
toss lightly.  Spoon into serving bowls, sprinkle with Parmesan
cheese and serve. Personal Note: A little shredded carrot or
julienned roasted red pepper adds not only flavor but eye-appealing
color.  A sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes (or one of Mrs.
Dashes seasonings) adds a little snap! _O_ ~\_O_ /( )\ ( )\ ~ / \ ~
