Title: Bloomin' Onion
Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
1    Sweet onion
1    Eggs
1 tb Milk
2 tb Flour
1 c  Cracker crumbs, crushed
Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin but leave root intact,
cutting off any hanging roots.  With ordinary paring knife, core out
top third of center. Angle knife for best results. Divide onion into
four sections, by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and
cutting toward the root, stopping about 1/2-inch away. Cut each
section twice again. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to
cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or "petals," will
begin to open.

Remove onion from hot water and immerse in ice water, which will
further the opening.  Drain well by turning upside down on a paper
towel.

Put flour into paper bag (season with any seasonings you'd
like--Cajun, cayenne, plain ol' s&p, etc), add onion and shake gently
to coat with flour.  Beat egg and milk; roll floured onion in egg.
Put cracker crumbs in paper bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat.
Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying to set the coating.

Heat oil to 375-380 degrees. If oil isn't hot enough, it will be
greasy and the batter may not stick.  If oil is too hot, outside will
burn before inside is cooked. Place onion petal-side DOWN in HOT oil
or use a wire basket.  Cook until golden brown, 3-5 minutes.

Cooked onion can be kept for a time in a warm oven. Serve with sauce
made of Russian dressing and horseradish.
