Title: Pierogi Dough With Potato And Cheese Filling
Categories: Appetizers, Polish, Pie/tart
Yield: 48 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 c  Warm water
4 c  SIFTED flour
Egg -- beaten
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
6 lg Potatoes
3 oz Cream cheese
1/4 lb Cheese (any kind)
Salt and pepper
Chives (optional)
Fried onions (optional)
Sauerkraut (optional)
DOUGH: Form a well in flour and slowly mix in egg and water. Knead
for 10 minutes. If it seems to stiff add more water. Set aside
covered for 5 or 10 minutes. Filling: Boil potatoes, drain and while
still HOT add; cream cheese, cheese (any kind), she uses sliced
American cheese, salt and pepper, and chives (optional). You may have
to add a little milk or cream. Mix with electric mixer until smooth.

Sometimes she'll add fried onions and sauerkraut to the potato
mixture. After filling, place in boiling water until they float to
the top or are tender. Drain and drizzle with melted butter to keep
from sticking. We eat them with sour cream and fried onions on them.
You can also fry them. They also freeze very well.
