REGAN'S LEMON-BLUEBERRY
TART
============================
A fabulous '90s version of lemon pie from Regan Daly. If desired,
sprinkle the edges with icing sugar before serving.

PASTRY:

1 3/4 c  All-Purpose Flour 1/3 c Granulated Sugar 1/4 c Fine Yellow
Cornmeal 2 ts Fresh Grated Lemon Rind 3/4 ts Baking Powder 1/2 ts
Salt 1/2 c  Cold Butter; cut into cubes 1 ea Egg 1 ea Egg Yolk

FILLING:

1 c  Granulated Sugar 3 ea Eggs 3 ea Egg Yolks 2/3 c Lemon Juice 1 ts
Fresh Grated Lemon Rind 1/2 c Softened Butter

TOPPING:

2-3 c  Fresh Blueberries (1-1 1/2 pints); washed; picked over

In large bowl, combine flour, sugar, cornmeal, lemon rind, baking
powder and salt. Using pastry blender or two knives, work in butter
until mixture resembles coarse meal. Using fork, gently stir in egg
and yolk until mixture is moist and crumbly.

Sprinkle dough into 10-inch flan pan with removable bottom. Pat
evenly on bottom and up sides of pan. Line with parchment paper or
foil and fill with pie weights (Dry Beans work well). Bake in
preheated 350F oven 15 minutes. Remove pie weights and lining. Bake
10 to 15 minutes or until crust is golden. Cool.

Make filling in double boiler or bowl resting over pan of simmering
water. Whisk together sugar, eggs, egg yolks, lemon juice and rind
until smooth. Cook, stirring constantly about 7 minutes or until
thickened. Do not boil. Remove from heat and whisk in butter. Pour
into tart shell. Cool to room temperature.

Just before serving, arrange blueberries in concentric circles or
randomly on lemon filling.

Makes 8 servings.
