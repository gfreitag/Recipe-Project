A specialty of dining-car chefs during the Golden Age of Pullman
travel that well deserves its fame. Easily divided.

Cut chicken into quarters. Brush with oil and dredge with flour,
salt, and pepper. Fry salt pork until brown. Add nutmeg. Place
chicken on top of pork (without draining off fat) and baste with
melted butter. Cover skillet and cook about 30 minutes over
medium-low heat until tender. Turn chicken pieces over. Add 1 cup
cream, turn heat up to medium, and cook uncovered to let cream cook
down. When sauce is fairly thick, add another cup cream, cook as
before until thickened, and add the last cup cream. Cook until thick.
To serve, spoon cream gravy over chicken pieces, sprinkle with
paprika, and garnish with parsley sprigs. Serves 12.
