Title: EASY MARGARITAS
Categories: Beverages, Usenet
Yield: 3 servings
6 oz Limeade, frozen
6 oz Vodka
6 oz Water
Ice
Blend equal parts of limeade, vodka and water in a blender.  Add ice
and blend to slushiness desired. More ice makes it slushier.

NOTES:

*  Vodka margaritas.  Yield:  Serves 3-4.

*  Officially, a margarita calls for tequila instead of the vodka,
with a splash of triple sec.  No one notices the absence of the
triple sec  and many people prefer the taste of vodka.

: Difficulty:  trivial.
: Time:  2 minutes.
: Precision:  use equal measures of the ingredients.
