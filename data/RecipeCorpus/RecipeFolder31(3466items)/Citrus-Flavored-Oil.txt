Title: Citrus Flavored Oil
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 /2 cup
2 md Orange or
3 md Lemons, Meyer lemons
-or limes
-cut into eighths
1 c  Olive oil
Roughly chop the fruit  skin, seeds, and all  in a food processor with
short pulses or use a chef's knife. Do not process to a pure. If the
fruit is too finely chopped, the oil will emulsify with the pulp and
not separate. Transfer the fruit to the work bowl of an electric
mixer and add the oil. Mix on low speed for 10 minutes with the
paddle attachment. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours.

Rinse 4 layers of cheesecloth in cold water and squeeze dry. Suspend a
fine-mesh strainer over a fat separator or bowl. Put the citrus
mixture in the cheesecloth and squeeze to extract the oil. As you
squeeze, the web of the cheesecloth loosens. The strainer will catch
the bits of pulp which may escape. Let stand again to allow oil and
juice to separate. The clear oil will float above the thick mixture
of juice, pulp, and some emulsified oil. Pour off oil into a
sterilized glass jar or bottle and discard juice. Cover tightly,
refrigerate, and use within 1 week.

Note: If fruit has thick skins, the pith may add some bitterness to
the oil. To avoid this, peel the zest with a vegetable peeler, put in
a food processor, and chop finely. Cut the pith off the fruit being
careful not to cut into the pulp. You want to save as much juice and
pulp as possible. Cut the fruit into eighths and process with the
zest. Then put in a electric mixer and mix as above.

Variation for Kumquats: Use  pound fruit for 1 cup oil and follow the
method above.
