Title: Norwegian Christmas Bread^
Categories: Breads, Depress/era, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Milk, scalded
1    Yeast cake
Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter, melted
pn Cardamom
1 c  Raisins
3/4 c  Citron, chopped
1 ts Salt
Let milk cool; add yeast and enough flour to make a sponge, about 1 -
2 cups. Put in a warm place and let raise good, about an hour. Then
add to it sugar, butter, cardamom, raisins, citron and salt. Mix
well. Gradually add enough flour to knead into a stiff dough. Let
raise again good (another hour) and then make into 2 round loaves.
Let raise again; bake at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes. A raised
nut bread can be made with this recipe by omitting the raisins and
citron and adding 1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
