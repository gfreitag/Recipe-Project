Preheat the oven to 350'F. Spray, then flour two 9x9" pans. Melt the
butter and chocolate over low heat; cool.

Beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium
speed until thick and smooth, about 3 minutes. Stir in the
chocolate-butter mixture, then slowly add the flour. Do not overmix.
Fold in the cookie crumbs and most of the pecans. Spread the batter
evenly into the pans and sprinkle with the remaining pecans. Bake
about 40 minutes, or until set. (The brownies will be soft in the
center.) Let cool completely. Cut into 3x3" squares.
