Title: Lemonade in a Crock
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 8 servings
4 ea Large lemons
3/4 c  Sugar
1 qt Water
Ice cubes for 8 glasses
Fresh mint
Wash fruit well and cut into thin slices, removing seeds. Place lemon
slices and sugar in crock or ceramic bowl. Let stand 10 mins <Marge's
note--I'd let em sit a lot longer>

Press lemons firmly with a potato masher to extract juice and oil from
rinds. Add the water, and continue to mash the fruit until the liquid
is well flavored.

Just before serving, add ice cubes. Garnish with mint.
