TOMATO SAUCE:  Prepare vegetables as indicated in the ingredient list
& set aside.  Heat oil in a large pot until hot, & saute the chopped
& diced vegetables just until the onion has softened.  Add the herbs
& continue to saute stirring occasionally for a few minutes longer.
Add the rest of the sauce ingredients & let simmer for 15 minutes,
stir occasionally. Set aside, once coked.

BECHAMEL SAUCE:  Heat oil, stir in the flour & cook for about 30
seconds. Remove from the heat & slowly beat in the milk, ensuring
that no lumps form.  Return to the heat & cook, stirring over medium
heat, until the sauce has thickened.  Season with salt, pepper &
nutmeg. Set aside.

TO ASSEMBLE:  If using dried pasta, it is advisable to cook it first.
If using fresh pasta, just sprinkle with a few drops of water before
baking.

Ladle several spoonfuls of tomato sauce in the bottom of a lasagna
pan then top with 1/4 of pasta, let the sheets rise up the sides of
the pan. Top with half the bechamel sauce & half the peas.  Add
another layer of pasta, another layer of tomato sauce & top with a
third layer of pasta. Add the remaining bechamel sauce & peas.  Top
with the rest of the tomato sauce. Drizzle with olive oil & sprinkle
with thyme.

Bake in a pre-heated oven at 400F for 40 minutes, until bubbling hot.
Serve with home-made garlic bread & a green salad.

* If using fresh peas, blanch before adding them to the lasagna
layers.
