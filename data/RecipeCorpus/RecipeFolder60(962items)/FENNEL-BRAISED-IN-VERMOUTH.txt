Note: The author says that the braising liquid deepens fennel's
delicate flavor.

Heat oil in large deep skillet; saute onion and garlic until softened,
about 3 minutes.  Add sliced fennel and toss until glazed, 2 to 3
minutes. Add vermouth and braise the fennel until tender-crisp -
about 8 minutes. Add the minced fennel tops, half-and-half, salt and
pepper and cook another 4 to 5 minutes to reduce and slightly thicken
the sauce. Sprinkle with grated cheese; serve immediately.
