Title: FETTUCINE WITH MUSHROOMS & CREAM
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 2 Servings
1 sm Onion; finely sliced
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Dried mixed herbs
100 g  Mushrooms, sliced
5 tb Single cream
175 g  Fettucine
-- cooked 'al dente'
1    Egg; beaten
Salt and pepper
Grated Parmesan to garnish
Classic Mediterranean food, a creamy mushroom sauce is folded into
freshly cooked fettucine, and an egg lightly scrambled into the
mixture at the last moment until it is lightly set. Serve this with a
garlicky green salad and some warm granary bread.

Simmer the sliced onion gently in the oil until thoroughly softened,
then add the herbs and let them soften too, stirring. Add the
mushrooms and stir them until their juices start to run. Stir the
cream into the mixture and heat through. Pour the sauce over the hot,
drained fettucine in a saucepan, and put over a very gentle heat.
Finally add the beaten egg and cook slowly, stirring, until the egg
begins to set. Check the seasoning and serve at once on warm plates.
Sprinkle grated Parmesan over the top.
