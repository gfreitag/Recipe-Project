BLANC: Saute shallots in 1 tablespoon clarified butter in a saucepot
and add lime juice, wine and vermouth. Reduce to about 1-1/2
teaspoons. Add heavy cream and reduce again. Set aside and, while
beating at the same time with a wire whip, immediately add the butter
in small pieces.  As the butter melts and creams the mixture,
continue adding it until all is absorbed. Season with salt, pepper
and red chile paste. Garnish with parsley. *To make clarified butter,
melt 1 stick of unsalted butter in a saucepan over low heat.  After
butter has completely melted, the solids will settle to the bottom.
Skim off any foam on top and carefully pour off the golden liquid on
top of the solids. Discard foam.
