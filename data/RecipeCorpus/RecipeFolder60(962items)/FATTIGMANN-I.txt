Title: FATTIGMANN I
Categories: Cookies, Norwegian
Yield: 8 Servings
16    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla, brandy or cognac
1 c  Whipping cream
1/2 ts Grated lemon rind
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
6 c  Flour
2 lb Shortening for frying
Beat the egg yolks until they are thick and lemon-colored. Add the
sugar a little at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Add
flavoring (vanilla, brandy or cognac).  Beat cream until stiff, and
fold in carefully.  Add lemon rind and cardamom. Work in flour until
dough is smooth.  Chill. Roll out dough as thin as possible and cut
into diamond shapes with knife or fluted pastry wheel. Make a slit in
center of each diamond and pull the tip end of diamond through slit
as far as it will go.
Drop into hot shortening (350 F).  Fry like doughnuts, but only
until very lightly browned.  They cook almost as fast as they are put
into the hot shortening, so they must be turned and taken out
quickly. Drain on paper and sprinkle with sugar. Makes about 10 dozen
fattigmann.
