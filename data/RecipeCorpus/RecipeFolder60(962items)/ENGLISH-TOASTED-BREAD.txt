Title: ENGLISH TOASTED BREAD
Categories: Breads, Breadmaker, Sourdough
Yield: 1 Servings  This is a bit different from most of the English Muffin type breads
for the breadmachine, as it uses sourdough starter. INGREDIENT 1#
Loaf 1 1/2# Loaf Warm water 5/8 C. 7/8 C. Baking soda 1/2 tsp. 3/4
tsp. Bread flour 2 1/4 C. 3 C. Dry milk 2 Tbl. 3 Tbl. Sea Salts 1
tsp. 1 1/2 tsp. Sourdough starters 1/2 C. 3/4 C. Oil 1 Tbl. 1 1/2
Tbl. Honey 1 tsp. 2 tsp. Active dry yeast 2 tsp. 1 pkg. In a small
cup, combine the warm water and baking soda, and set aside for 5
minutes. Fit the kneading blade firmly on the shaft in the bread pan.
Carefully measure the flour, dry milk and salt, transfer to the pan.
Add the Sourdough Starter, water-baking soda mixture, oil, honey, and
yeast. Place in bread pan inside the machine and close the lid.
Program the breadmaker for the whole wheat mode.  The unit will begin
its operation. At the end of the baking cycle, remove the bread
promptly from the machine, taking care as the oven surfaces will be
very hot. Invert the bread pan onto a wire rack and shake several
times to dislodge the bread. Allow to cool completely on the rack
before slicing or wrapping for storage. Source: The Bread Machine
