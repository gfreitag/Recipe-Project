Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Low-fat
Yield: 6 Servings
10 oz Pkg frozen raspberries in
Syrup, thawed
10 oz Pkg frozen strawberries in
Syrup, thawed
Cranberry juice cocktail or
Cranberry juice (optional)
1 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Raspberry or blackberry rum
(optional)
1    Recipe Vanilla Custard
Pudding
1    Angel food cake(about 10 oz)
1/4 c  Fresh raspberries or
Straberries (garnish)
Place the thawed raspberries and strawberries in a large sieve and
drain over a bowl.  Place the fruit in a medium bowl and set it
aside. Measure the syrup. You should have 1 cup; if necessary, add
enough cranberry juice to bring up the level. Transfer 1/4 cup of the
syrup to a small saucepan. Add the cornstarch and stir to mix well.
Stir in the remaining syrup and mix well.  Bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until the juice thickens and turns
clear. Stir in the brandy or rum (if using). Measure out and reserve
1/2 cup of the fruit for garnish. Meanwhile, prepare the custard,
cover, and chill. Cut the cake into bite-size pieces using a serrated
knife.  Place half of the pieces in a large straight-sided glass
bowl.  Spoon half of the fruit over the cake. Cover with half of the
custard. Repeat to use all the cake, fruit, and custard. Garnish the
top with the reserved fruit and the fresh raspberries or
strawberries. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 6
hours before serving. ~--
