Title: ELEPHANT EARS
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Milk
5 tb Sugar
5 tb Shortening
2 tb Salt
2    Envelopes Active Dry Yeast
2 c  Warm Water (105-115 degree)
6 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 qt Vegetable Oil
Cinnamon Sugar
Scald Milk; add Sugar, Shortening, & Salt.  Cool to lukewarm.

Sprinkle yeast onto warm water in lg. bowl.  Add Milk mixture & 2 Cups
Flour; beat until smooth.  Stir in enough additional Flour to make
stiff dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board; kneed until smooth &
elastic, about 8-10 min.  Place in a greesed bowl, turning to grease
top. Cover & let rise in a warm place, until double in size, about 1
hour.

Divide dough into 6-8 balls.  Roll each out in the form of an
elephant's ear.

Heat oil to 375 degrees.  Deep fry elephant's ears, one at a time, for
about 3-5 min. on each side or until golden brown. Serve hot,
sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Makes 6-8.

I also have the recipe for Navajo Fry Bread if you want it. Not as
complicated.  Make 18-24 pieces, each about the size of a 9" plate.
