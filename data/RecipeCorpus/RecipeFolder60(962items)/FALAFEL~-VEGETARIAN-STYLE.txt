Dice the onion into 1/4 pieces. Tear the french bread slices into
large pieces and soak in cold water to cover. Dice the cucumbers and
tomatoes and shred lettuce into small strips to add on top as
garnishes after sandwich is done. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Blend
garlic, 1/2 onion and parsely in a blender until finely minced. Add
chickpeas and blend until finely chopped and pasty. Add lemon juice,
cumin, basil, coriander, thyme and tabasco. Squeeze the water out of
bread and add to blender. Blend until well mixed. Form the mixture
into 16 balls. Flatten each ball to form a 1/2 inch thick patty and
dredge in flour. Place patties on a lightly greased baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes. Turn patties and bake another 10 minutes. Remove
from oven.  In a heavy large skillet heat half the olive oil over
medium high heat. Add patties and fry until golden brown on bottom.
Turn patties and add remainder of oil swirling it so it comes in
contact with all patties. Fry until brown and crispy, then drain on
paper towels. To serve: Cut off about 1/3 of each pita round and open
to form a pocket. Fill each pocket with 4 falafel balls. Garnish with
lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber and the sauces.
