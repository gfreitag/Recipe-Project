Title: FAKE BORDEN CRACKER JACK
Categories: Candies, Fake
Yield: 4 Quarts
4 qt Popped popcorn
1 c  Spanish peanuts
4 tb Butter
1 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
1/8 c  Molasses
1/4 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 250~F.  Combine the popcorn and peanuts in a metal
bowl or on a cookie sheet and place in the preheated oven. Combine
all of the remaining ingredients in a saucepan. Stirring over med.
heat, bring the mixture to a boil.  Using a cooking thermometer,
bring the mixture to the hard-ball stage (the point at which the
syrup, when dripped into cold water, forms a hard but pliable ball).
This will take about 20 to 25 minutes (or until you notice th
emoxture turning dark brown). Remove the popcorn and peanuts from the
oven and , working quickly, pour the caramel mixture in a fine stream
over them. Then place them back in the oven for 15 minutes.  Mix well
every five minutes, so that all of the popcorn is coated. Cool and
store in a covered container to preserve freshness.
