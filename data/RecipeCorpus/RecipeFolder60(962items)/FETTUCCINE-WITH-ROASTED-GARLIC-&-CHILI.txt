Fettuccine con Crema di Aglio e Peperoncino From the Williams-Sonoma
Kitchen Library Pasta Cookbook by Lorenza de Medici "Whole roasted
garlic heads have such a wonderful fragrance and flavor that you
might want to bake a few extra, for guests to squeeze onto crusty
chunks of bread. You can also make a similar onion sauce: roast 3
small brown-skinned onions, using the same method as for the garlic
heads, peel them and puree with the oil in a food processor.  Both
versions of the California cuisine-inspired sauce are also excellent
at room temperature."

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap each head of garlic separately
in aluminum foil.  Place the parcels on a rack in the center of the
oven and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the garlic heads from the oven
and set aside to cool slightly so that they can be handled. In a
large pot bring 6 qt salted water to a boil.  Add the fettuccine to
the boiling water and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, unwrap the
garlic heads, separate the cloves and squeeze the garlic cloves from
their papery sheaths into a hot serving bowl. Add the olive oil and
season to taste with salt. Sprinkle with the chili and blend together
well with a fork. Drain the pasta and transfer it to the serving
bowl. Toss the pasta with the sauce. Serve immediately. Serves 6.
