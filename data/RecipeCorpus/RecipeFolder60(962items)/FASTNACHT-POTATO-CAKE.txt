Boil the pared potatoes in enough water to cover them. Drain off the
potato water and save. Mash the potatoes and beat lightly. Measure
the potato water and add more water, if necessary, to make 1 1/2
pints. Combine with the rest of the ingredients, using enough flour
to make a rather stiff batter. Cover and let rise in a warm place
until morning. Knead in the morning, adding as much flour as is
necessary. Let rise again. Spread on well-greased tins and when light
(about 1-1/4 hours) brush melted butter over top. Strew with "rivels"
made by combining 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and 2 Tbsp butter.
