Title: FETTUCCINE ALFREDO (PRINCE)
Categories: Pasta, Sauces, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
12 oz Fettuccine
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Cream, heavy or light
1 1/2 c  Parmesan, grated
1/2 ts Salt
Pepper, white, dash
Romano cheese to taste
We add a little romano to this for extra flavor- not in the original
recipe- about 1 or 2 tablespoons.

Cook fettuccine according to package directions. While fettuccine
cooks, heat butter or margarine and cream in a small sauce pan until
butter melts. Stir in parmesan cheese., salt and pepper. Keep warm
over low heat. Drain fettuccine, return to pan, pour sauce over
noodles, toss gently until noodles are well coated.
