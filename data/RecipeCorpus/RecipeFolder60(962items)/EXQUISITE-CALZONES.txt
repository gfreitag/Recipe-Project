When piping hot, these make delicious mid-winter supper fare.
Chilled, they travel well to a summer picnic.

In a large bowl, combine ricotta, provolone, and fontina cheeses,
prosciutto, olives, pepperoncini, tomatoes and basil; set aside.
Brush 2 large baking sheets with olive oil (preferably that drained
from the tomatoes) or salad oil; set aside.

Divide each loaf of bread dough into 3 pieces. On a floured surface,
roll each piece into a 7-inch round. On half of each round, place a
heaping 1/2 cup of the ricotta mixture and spread it to within 1/2
inch of the edge.

In a small howl, beat the egg with the water.  Brush the mixture over
the edges of dough rounds, then fold empty half of dough round over
the filling, forming a crescent shape. Press or decoratively pinch
edges to seal.

Place 3 calzones on each baking sheet; brush each calzone with oil
and bake in a 400 oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown.
Serve immediately, or cool, then wrap and refrigerate. Re-warm to
desired temperature in a microwave oven prior to serving. Yields 6
servings.
