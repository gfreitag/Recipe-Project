Title: FAILED-FUDGE BAVARIAN CREAM
Categories: Pudding
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Recipe failed fudge, soupy
2 tb Unflavored gelatin; (2
-envelopes or 1/2 ounce)
2 lg Egg whites
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
1 c  Heavy cream
If fudge doesn't harden and is very, very runny, turn it into a
Bavarian Cream.

Take 1/2 cup runny fudge and sprinkle gelatin over it. Allow to sit
until gelatin softens and swells. Dissolve gelatin completely by
microwaving on medium (50%) for 15 to 30 seconds, or by placing over
hot water. Mix warmed fudge back into the rest of fudge and let cool
to room temperature. Beat egg whites, adding cream of tartar when
they become frothy. Continue beating to stiff peaks, and fold into
fudge mixture. Beat cream in chilled bowl using chilled beaters until
stiffened but not thick--it should hold soft peaks--and fold into
fudge mixture. Pour into 6-cup mold and chill until ready to serve.
