porcini and saute until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add butter and
thyme; stir 1 minute. Add broth and 1 1/4 cup reserved mushroom
soaking liquid. Boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.

Drain pasta. Add to sauce; toss. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer
pasta to bowl. Top with 4 tablespoons cheese.
