Title: FAT FREE GRANOLA
Categories: Low fat, Cereals
Yield: 1 Servings
5    Apples
1/4 c  Raisins
Cinnamon, cloves
Pour boiling water over the raisins and let sit for five minutes.
Core and cut the apples (I use McIntosh when available) into thick
slices and place in a casserole dish. Add raisins and mix. Sprinkle
on cinnamon (about 1/2 teaspoon) and a pinch of ground cloves.

Bake covered in 350 F oven for 30 - 40 minutes.  At this point the
apples should be tender, but not mushy. Add enough granola to cover
the apples and put uncovered casserole back in oven for about 15
minutes or until granola is browned.

Serve warm with soymilk or an ice cream-like substance. Or serve cold
with warm soymilk or warm custard.
