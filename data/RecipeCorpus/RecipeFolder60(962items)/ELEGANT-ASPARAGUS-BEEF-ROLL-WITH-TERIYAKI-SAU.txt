2 tb Teriyaki sauce
2 tb Broth
Preparation: ============

Cook the asparagus by boiling, steaming, stir-frying or microwaving
until it's tender.  (The whole spear with the tough end cut off
should be kept whole.) Steaming takes 2 to 3 minutes. Stir-frying 1
to 2 and so on. Use whatever method you prefer.

Prepare the marinade for the beef by mixing all of the ingredients
well and setting them aside.

Prepare some braising sauce for the cooking and set aside.

Slice your beef loin into very thin slices.  Put them in a small
baking dish or shallow bowl and cover with marinade ingredients. Stir
well to mix and set in a refrigerator for ten minutes or more.

Cooking: ========

Take one of the marinated slices of beef and "fill" it with some
Inoki mushroom, some Shitake mushroom, a little green onion, and
steamed asparagus and roll the beef. Use a toothpick to secure the
meat.

Brown in a little peanut oil (two rolls per person as a serving).

Add the braising sauce (Teriyaki and broth) and cover, cooking over
medium heat for three to four minutes until done.

Serve rolls with cooked rice, and garnish with drippings from the
pan and some Inoki mushrooms.
