Title: FESTIVE CHICKEN SALAD LOG
Categories: Salads
Yield: 10 Servings
8 oz Cream cheese, softened
1/4 c  Mayonnaise or salad dressing
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1/8 ts Pepper
4 dr Red pepper sauce
2 c  Finely cut-up cooked chicken
2    Hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1/4 c  Sliced green onions
-(2 to 3 medium)
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPINGS-------------------------------
3    Green pepper rings
1 tb Toasted sesame seed
3 tb Chopped green onion or
-green pepper
3 tb Chopped pitted ripe olives
3 tb Chopped pimiento, drained
Mix cheese, mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, ginger, pepper, and pepper
sauce. Stir in chicken, eggs, and 1/4 cup onions. Shape into log, 8x2
inches. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.

Cut each green pepper ring once to make a curled strip. Place strips
diagonally across log, dividing log into fourths. Sprinkle each
section with one of the four remaining toppings. Serve with crackers.
Makes about 10-12 servings.

NOTE:  The toppings make it look fancier, but usually I dispense with
them and just mound the mix into a serving dish. It's great!
