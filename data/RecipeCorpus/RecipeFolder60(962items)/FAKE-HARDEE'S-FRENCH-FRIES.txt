Title: FAKE HARDEE'S FRENCH FRIES
Categories: Vegetables, Fake, Side dish
Yield: 5 Dozen
6 c  Vegetable oil
1/3 c  Sugar
2 c  Warm water
2 lg Russett potatoes, peeled
Salt
Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over low-med. heat for about 20
minutes. In a med. bowl, mix the sugar into the water until
dissolved. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise, and then into 1/4"
strips. Put the potatoes into the sugar solution and soak for 15
minutes. Remove the potatoes and dry them thoroughly on paper towels.
The right oil temperature is crucial here. To test the oil, fry a
couple of potato slices for 6 minutes. Remove and cool, then taste.
The fries should no get too dark too soon and should be soft in the
middle.  If the oil is too hot, turn it down and test again. The
fries should not be undercooked, either. If they are, turn up the
heat. When the oil temperature is just right, put all of the potato
slices in the oil for 1 minute.  This is the blanching stage. Take
the fries out of the oil and let them cool. When the fries have
cooled, place them into the oil again for 5 minutes, or until golden
brown. Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-covered plate.
Salt to taste.
