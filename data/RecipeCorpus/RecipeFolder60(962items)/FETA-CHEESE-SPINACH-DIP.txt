Title: FETA CHEESE SPINACH DIP
Categories: Dips
Yield: 96 Servings
8 oz Cream cheese
10 oz Feta cheese
10 oz Spinach
1/4 c  Milk
1/2    Onions, chopped
5    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/4 c  Milk
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Thyme
1/4 ts Salt
4    Coriander seeds
1 tb Honey
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
Put the cheeses into a blender, and mash them down. You'll need to
add milk to get them to blend. Add just enough so that they blend
well. Then, put the spinach in in small clumps. Blend, and put more
spinach in, until the whole bunch is gone. You'll have a nice green
goo.

At this point, if you have a blender specifically for strong veggies,
you can put the veggies in with the spinach. I put half the onion in
before I realized that my roommate probably wouldn't like her shakes
flavored with the faint taste of garlic and onion; I then carefully
picked the onion out. You can skip that step
:*)

Pour the cheese mix into a medium saucepan. Mix the remaining
ingredients in.  Add milk to taste.  Bring it slow boil, and cook
until it's a little more liquidy than you want: it'll thicken as it
cools.

Eat with dippin' chips. Tortilla chips work great, too. Also good on
french bread. (Advice: make this just before the party.
Otherwise, there won't be any left.)
