This is an excellent relish for using up excess garden produce left
at the end of the summer. It's good with meat and poultry and with a
sharply flavored cheese, such as a mature cheddar. Makes nine 1/2
pint jars.

Layer tomatoes, cabbage, bell peppers, celery, onions and cucumber
with the salt in a large non-aluminum bowl. Let stand overnight to
draw out the moisture.

Drain the vegetables in a sieve, pressing them to remove as much
liquid as possible. rinse in the sieve under cold running water,
drain again, and pat dry on paper towels. Put the vegetables into a
large, non-aluminum saucepan. Add the sugar and vinegar; stir to mix.
Simmer the mixture for 1 hour or until the vegetables are tender and
the sauce has thickened.

Meanwhile, wash 9 half pint jars. Keep hot until needed. Prepare lids
as manufacturer directs.

Spoon the relish into one hot jar at a time, leaving 1/2 inch head
space. Wipe jar rim and threads with a clean, damp cloth. Attach lid.
fill and close remaining jars.

Process in a boiling water bath canner for 10 minutes.
