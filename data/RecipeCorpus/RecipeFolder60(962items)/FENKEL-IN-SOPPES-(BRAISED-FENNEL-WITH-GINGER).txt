8 oz Onions, thickly sliced
1 ts Ground ginger, heaping
1 ts Powdered saffron

OPTIONAL: 6 thick slices of coarse wholewheat bread. Clean and cut the
fennel root in matchsticks. Put the fennel in a wide, lidded pan with
the onions. Sprinkle over the spices and salt, then the oil and

or place one slice of bread on each warmed plate, cover it with the
fennel and pour over the juices.
