Title: FALL FEAST - HOMESTYLE POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Red potatoes
1/3 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Dijon mustard
1/4 c  Fresh mint or parsley, chop
Salt
Pepper
Place potatoes in pot of cold salted water to cover. Bring to boil
and boil for about 10 minutes, or until just tender. Drain well.

Slice potatoes thinly and return to pot. In a small bowl, mix together
cream and mustard. Stir into potatoes.

Simmer over a low heat until sauce is slightly thickened and partially
absorbed by potatoes. Stir in mint. Season with salt and pepper, if
needed.

[if you like garlic, peel and slice three cloves and cook along with
the potatoes]
