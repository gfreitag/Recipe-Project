Title: FARINATA (CHICK PEA BAKE)
Categories: Italian, Argentinian, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
6 1/4 c  Water
4 c  Garbanzo (chick pea) flour
Salt; to taste
8 tb Olive oil; or corn oil
1 lg Onion, sliced (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper
This Italian dish is also popular in Argentina.  They call it faina'
and it is sometimes prepared with onion slices as a topping. A plain
faina' slice is often used to top a pizza slice, sandwich-style.

Pour the water into a large heavy pan, then gradually stir in the
flour. Add salt to taste.  Cook over gentle heat for 1 hour, stirring
frequently and skimming the surface with a slotted spoon
occasionally; the mixture should be smooth and quite thick.

Pour the mixture into an oiled roasting pan (preferably a pizza pan)
and level the surface. Sprinkle the oil over the surface, and arrange
the onion rings on top, if used.

Bake in a moderately hot oven (400 F / 200 C) for 30 minutes until
golden brown.  Sprinkle liberally with pepper and serve immediately.
