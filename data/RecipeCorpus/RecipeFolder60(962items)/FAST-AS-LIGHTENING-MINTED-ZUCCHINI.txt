Title: FAST AS LIGHTENING MINTED ZUCCHINI
Categories: Vegetables, Dkuhnen msn
Yield: 4 Servings
4 md Zucchini
Salt
1 ts Black pepper
1 tb Mint infused oil
Thirty minutes before eating, grate zucchini into a food processer.
Wrap the grated zucchini in a double thickness of paper towel and set
aside for 30 minutes. If you're making a large quantity of zucchini,
divide it in half and wrap in two paper-towel bundles as one will not
be enough to soak up all the moisture.  Heat a saute pan over
medium-high heat. Add the zucchini, salt, pepper, and mint oil. Cook
for 2 to 3 minutes, tossing as it cooks, until just tender.  Serve
immediately. Adapted by Deb Kuhnen from...Essential Flavors by Leslie
