Title: FAST FOOD 1 (RICE & VEGGIES) (QUICK)(VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Dec., Lunch, Quick
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Instant rice
x  Water
x  Frozen vegetables
x  Seasoning, sauce or
Dressing
Pour instant rice into a bowl.  Add twice the volume of water. Stir.
Pour in some frozen veggies (broccoli, carrots, peas, 'mixed',
whatever happens to be in the freezer.) Pour on a glub or two of
flavoring agent (tomato sauce, salad dressing, whatever happens to be
in the fridge.) Nuke on high for 3 minutes.

Note:  This isn't real high nutritional value. Single-serving bricks
of frozen cooked rice/beans/barley/lentils would go a long way towards
improving it.  I ate this many many times...
