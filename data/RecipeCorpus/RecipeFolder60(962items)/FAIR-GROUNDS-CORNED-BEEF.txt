12 lb Corned beef brisket
3    Bay leaves
1 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Dill seed
10    Whole cloves
1 tb Red chiles; chopped
1 tb Whole black peppercorns
1 ts Ground mace
1 ts Cardamom
1 ts Mustard seeds
1 tb Coriander
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Allspice
1/4 c  Salt
Place brisket in heavy stock pot and cover with water. Mix all
seasoning together except salt. Put all ingredients in a cheese-cloth
bag and tie together. Boil brisket and seasoning together with salt
for 2-1/2 to 3 hours. To test, stick a fork in the middle of brisket;
it should come out easy when done. Cool and slice. Pour a little of
the stock over the brisket for added flavor. Serve with your favorite
smothered cabbage recipe. This recipe is from the Fair Grounds Race
Track in New Orleans. They are famous for their corned beef. This
100-year old landmark burned to the ground last year and it was a sad
day for all New Orleanians.
