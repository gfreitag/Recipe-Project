Title: FATFREE PIE CRUST
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Grape Nuts
1/2 c  Apple juice concentrate
mix together and press into the pie pan.  Bake 10 minutes at 350
degrees and cool if you'll add a cool filling. For pumpkin pie, I
just add the filling and bake it all at once.

I run the Grape Nuts through the food processor first, and I find a
half recipe is sufficient if you don't need the crust to go too far
up the side of the pan.
