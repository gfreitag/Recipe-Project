Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, Fake

2 c  80-proof vodka
2 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Vanilla extract
1 1/2 tb Instant coffee
Bottle to store liqueur
Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan.  Cover and cook over
medium

heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved.
Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool. Be sure to keep it
covered. Store in any empty bottle with a screw top or another bottle
with a resealable lid. Note: It is very important that you use a
covered saucepan when making this drink.  the alcohol will boil away
if the solution is not covered when it gets hot. Also,the longer this
drink is bottled and stored in a dark, cool place, the better it will
taste. For the best flavor, store it for at least thirty days before
drinking. Makes great gifts. Source:  Top Secret Recipes by Todd
