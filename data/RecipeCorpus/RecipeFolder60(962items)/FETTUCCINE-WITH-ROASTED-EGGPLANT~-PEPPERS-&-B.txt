Categories: Italian, Main dish, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Pasta
1 1/2 lb Eggplant
6 tb Virgin olive oil
3    Garlic cloves
20    Nicoise or Gaeta olives
Pitted and chopped
1/2 c  Basil leaves coarsely choppd
Salt and fresh ground pepper
2    Bell peppers, red or yellow
1 c  Bread crumbs
Balsamic vinegar to taste
Parmesan or Romano cheese
Preheat oven to 400 degrees

Prick eggplant in several places and then bake the whole eggplant(s)
until they are wrinkled and soft, about 20 minutes. (Cooking time
will depend on the size of the eggplants.) Turn them once halfway
through cooking.

Let the eggplant(s) cool a few minutes, then slit them open and peel
away the skins. Shred or tear the eggplants into pieces and combine
them with olive oil, garlic, olives and half the basil. Add the
roasted pepper strips. (To roast your own, see below.) Season with
salt and pepper , and set aside.

Toss breadcrumbs with enough oil to moisten them and toast them in a
hot oven (400 degrees) until they are crisp and golden. Remove and
set aside.

When you are ready to cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted
water to a boil. Transfer the eggplant-pepper mix to a large skillet
and warm gently over low heat. Add pasta to water and cook until al
dente. Drain pasta and add it to the vegetable mixture, stirring
gently to combine. Add the remaining basil leaves and season to tast
with salt, freshly ground pepper and splash of vinegar.

Divide pasta amoung four plates. Garnish each with breadcrumbs and
pass around the grated cheese.

To roast peppers: Set whole peppers just beneath a preheated broiler.
Turn, using long-handled tongs, until all sides are charred black.
Transfer to a mixing bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. When
peppers are cool enough to handle, pull off blackened skins, and
remove cores, seeds and veins. Cut into strips about 1/4-inch wide.
