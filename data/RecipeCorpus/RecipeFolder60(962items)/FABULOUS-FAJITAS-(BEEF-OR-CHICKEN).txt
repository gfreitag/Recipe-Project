Flank steak is a bood substitute for skirt steak cut from legs of
beef. It's lean, and some people find it too tough. Citrus marinade
helps to tenderize it. Make sure the membrane is cut. If using flank,
cut meat into strips. For chicken fajitas, use skinless boneless
chicken breasts. Do not marinade for more than 60 minutes. -- Beth
