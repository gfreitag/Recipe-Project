Categories: Fake, Poultry, Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Peanut oil
1    Egg
1 c  Milk
1 c  Flour
2 1/2 tb Powdered sugar
1/2 ts Pepper
2 tb Salt
2    Skinless, boneless chicken
-breasts, halved
4    Plain hamburger buns
2 tb Melted butter
8    Dill pickle slices
Heat the peanut oil in a pressure cooker over med. heat to about
400~F. In a small bowl, beat the egg and stir in the milk. In a
separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, pepper, and salt. dip each
piece of chicken in milk until it is fully moistened. Roll the
moistened chicken in the flour mixture until completely coated. Drop
all four chicken pieces into the hot oil and close the pressure
cooker. When steam starts shooting through the pressure release, set
the timer for 3-1/2 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, spread a
coating of melted butter on the face of each bun. When the chicken is
done, remove it from the oil and drain or blot on paper towels. Place
two pickles on each bottom bun; add a chicken breast, then the top
bun. To make a deluxe chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato slices
and a leaf of lettuce. Mayonnaise also goes well on this sandwich--it
is a side order at the restaurant.
