Mousse and sauce can be done a day in advance. To prepare mousse,
melt bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and set aside to cool to
room temperature. Combine butter and marsala in a small bowl and set
over boiling water. Heat until marsala is bubbling and butter melted.
Remove bowl from pan and let cool a few moments, then whisk in yolks.
Place again over boiling water and stir until yolks begin to thicken.
Cool. Add cream of tartar to whites and beat to soft peaks and
gradually beat in sugar until stiff and glossy. Gently fold together
whites, cooled chocolate, egg mixture, cream and nuts, taking care to
keep mixture light. Turn into a freezer container and freeze at least
4 hours. Let stand a couple of hours in refrigerator to soften before
serving.

To make the sauce, combine the coffee with boiling water and stir
until dissolved. Turn into a small bowl, adding the marsala,
chocolate and sugar. Set over a pan of hot water and stir until
chocolate is melted. Stir in butter until smooth. Reheat before
serving.

To serve, use a small ice cream scoop to spoon out about 4 balls of
mousse into each of 8 wine glasses. Drizzle with hot sauce and serve.
