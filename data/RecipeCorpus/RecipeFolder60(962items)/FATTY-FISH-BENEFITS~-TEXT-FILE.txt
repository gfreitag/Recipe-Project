MMMMM-------------------BENEFITS OF FATTY FISH------------------------
In an article in the December journal of the American Dietetic
Association, editor Elaine R. Morgan reports on the recommendation to
have two servings weekly of fatty fish.

The fat in fish contains omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce the risk of
heart disease, kidney-related diseases and skin disorders.

The report further states that pregnant women and children benefit
from omega-3 fatty acids in that they are important for the
development of brain and nerve cells, including the eyes.

The recommendation does not mean that you should add more fat to the
diet but rather that you should substitute another source of protein
in the diet with fish twice a week to reduce the amount of saturated
fat in the diet. Fish contains highly unsaturated fat.

The following list was compiled by the National Fisheries Institute.
It is a listing of fish and shellfish according to omega-3 content in
a 3 1/2 ounce serving.

Most (More than 1.0 gram) Anchovy, Atlantic bluefish, Atlantic
salmon, coho salmon, herring, mackerel, pilchards, pink salmon,
sablefish, sardines, sockeye salmon, spiny dogfish, and whitefish.

Moderate (0.5 to 0.9 gram) chum, salmon, pompano, rainbow trout,
shark, smelt, spot, striped bass, swordfish, Pacific oysters, and
squid.

Least (less than 0.5 gram) carp, channel catfish, cod, flounder,

roughy, pike, pollock, rockfish, sea bass, snapper, whiting, clams,
