Categories: Lamb, Algerian, Holiday
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Butter
1 lb Lamb; in 3-inch pieces
1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
3 c  Water
1/4 c  Sugar

The holy celebration of Ramadhan is when the Algerian Muslims eat this
sweet lamb after a day of fasting. It is almost a dessert meat, with
raisins, prunes, sugar, almonds and orange blossom water, and it is
cooked without salt, to prevent thirst the next day for those fasting.

1. Melt the butter in a pan, add the lamb and saute over low heat for
5 minutes. Add the cinnamon, water and sugar and mix well. Increase
the heat to moderate and cook for about 40 minutes, or until the meat
is tender. The sauce will darken.

2. Drain the prunes and add them to the lamb with the raisins,
almonds and pear. Simmer for 15 minutes more. Remove the pan from the
heat and stir in the orange blossom water.

Serve at room temperature with rice, salad and bread. Serves 4 to 6
with other dishes.
