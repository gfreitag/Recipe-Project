Title: FANTASTIC FRUIT MUFFINS (OVO LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Quick-cooking oats
3/4 c  Skim milk
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Plus 2*tablespoons brown
Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
2 tb Plus*1*1/2*teaspoons Prune
Puree
2    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Finely chopped fresh pears
(about 1*1/2*medium)
1/3 c  Coarsely chopped fresh or
Frozen cranberries
1/3 c  Golden raisins
MMMMM------------------------PRUNE PUREE-----------------------------
3 oz Prunes (about*1/2*cup)
1 c  Water or fruit juice
use blender or food processor to puree prunes. use immediately or
store in airtight container in fridge.

Combine the oats and skim milk, stir to mix well, and set aside for at
least 5 minutes.

Combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda, and
stir to mix well.  Add the oat milk mixture and the Prune Puree, egg
whites, vanilla extract, and pears, and stir just until the dry
ingredients are moistened.  Fold in the cranberries and raisins.

Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray, and fill 3/4 full with
the batter.  Bake at 350F for 15 to 17 minutes, or just until a wooden
toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin comes out clean.

Remove the muffin tin from the oven, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes
before removing the muffins.  Serve warm or at room temp.

My experience: I substituted frozen and thawed mixed berries for the
cranberries. Making extra prune puree as stated above is confusing --
next time I'll just throw some prunes (probably 2-3) and juice in the
blender.

The cook time may be low -- mine took 20 - 25 minutes.
