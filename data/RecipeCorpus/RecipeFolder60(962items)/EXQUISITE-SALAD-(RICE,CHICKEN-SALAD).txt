Prepare rice according to pkg. directions. C hill Plave vinegar, oil,
sugar, garlic and cilantro in blender. Blend until smooth. Season to
taste with salt & white pepper. Combine rice, chicken , green onions,
tomato, escarole, asparagus and avocado. Toss with dressing. Serve
immediately or chill to blend flavors. P.S. I have doubled this
recipe - but not doubled the dressing and it was delicious. P.S. P.S.
for the vegans out there - this is also great - sans the chicken. You
might want to through in a few peanuts or chopped pecans.

UMMMMMMMGood I prepare everything the day before and combine just
before serving.
