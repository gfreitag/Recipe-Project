1 lb Medium Shrimp -- peeled &

Note:  The beans in this recipe will need to be soaked overnight

Put the beans in a non aluminum container and cover with 5 inches of
codl water.  Soak overnight and then drain well. Place them with all
other ingredients except the salt (see note) and shrimp, in a pot
that will comfortably hold them all.

Pour enough cold water over the ingredients to cover them by about 3
inches. Cook gently at a simmer for about 1 hour or more. The liquid
in the beans should be mostly absorbed by the time they finish
cooking and the beans shoul dbe very moist and succulent. Do not let
them go dry. Add the salt to taste.  Serve the beans hot, drizzled
with olive oil; they are equally good at room temperature.

Sautee the shrimp in the olive oil with a pinch of salt and pepper for
about 2 minutes, stirring often. Do not overcook. Serve the shrimp
with warm beans or slightly chilled with room temperature beans.

Note:  Adding salt to beans before they are fully cooked toughens
them.

Serves 6 to 8.

NOTES: The beans are delicious without shrimp. They make a tasty
accompaniment to roast or grilled meat, fowl or fish. If you increase
the amount of cooking water, you an have a delectable baean soup.
