Title: EXOTIC TAMALES - PART 1 OF 7 - CARNITAS
Categories: Mexican, Filling
Yield: 1 /2 pound
2 lb Pork butt with fat; cut into
-1-1/2 inch cubes
2 c  Water
3 tb Chile caribe
1 1/2 tb Kosher salt
4    Cloves garlic; roasted and
-chopped
1/3 c  Chopped onion
2    Cloves
1 ts Fennel seed
2 ts Cumin seed
1    Stick cinnamon
1 tb Dried Mexican oregano
Put pork, water, chile, salt, garlic and onion in a heavy saucepan and
bring to a low simmer. Roast spices and oregano in a dry saute pan
over medium heat until fragrant.

In a spice mill, grind spices and oregano to a powder. Add the pork
and continue to simmer, uncovered, for 1-1/2 hours until tender,
adding more water as needed. Increase heat and cook until all liquid
has evaporated. Reduce heat slightly and continue to cook, stirring
until the cubes of meat are a mahogany brown. Let cool.

Note: Pork is the most traditional filling for tamales in Central
Mexico. Pork has more natural moisture than beef and so makes a good
filling for tamales. This recipe provides a useful means of using up
ends of loins or other cuts of pork not used for entrees. The flavors
of tropical fruit and pork go particularly well together, which is
why the Manchamantel sauce is the perfect accompaniment for this
tamale.
