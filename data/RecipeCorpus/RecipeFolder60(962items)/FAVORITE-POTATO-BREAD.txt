Categories: Breads, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
2 ts Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
6 c  Whole wheat flour
2 ts Salt
1    Egg
1 c  Mashed potato
- up to 1 1/2 cups
1 c  Hot potato water
2 tb Honey
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 c  Plain yogurt or buttermilk
Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Combine flour and salt; make a well in
the center of the mixture.  Blend together egg, mashed potatoes,
potato water, honey and oil. Combine baking soda and yogurt or
buttermik; add to egg mixture.  Pour mixture into well of flour and
salt; blend thoroughly. Turn onto lightly floured surface and knead
10 minutes. Cover and let rise 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until a 1/2-inch
hole in dough made with a wet fingertip remains.  If the hole fills
in slightly, give the dough more time to rise. Deflate gently.  Let
rest 10 minutes.  Shape into loaves and let rise until almost
doubles, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1
hour.
