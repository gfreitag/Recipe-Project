Prepare the crust:

1. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with 1
tablespoon butter.

2. Combine cookie crumbs, nuts and melted butter in a medium bowl.
Toss until butter is absorbed. Press crumb mixture on the bottom and
sides of pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.

Prepare the filling:

3. In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, brown sugar, granulated
sugar, flour and salt with an electric mixer at medium speed until
free of lumps. Mix in vanilla. Beat in eggs and yolk, one at a time,
and continue beating until batter is smooth. Stir in cream and
candies. Pour filling into crust.

4. Bake on the middle shelf in a preheated 325-degree oven until
cheesecake is fairly firm to touch (center will jiggle slightly when
pan is tapped), about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, then
refrigerate at least 6 hours.

5. Remove cheesecake from pan and decorate as desired. Diana Moles of
Eli's research and development staff suggests drizzling the cake with
milk chocolate ganache, or drizzling with Smucker's Magic Shell
chocolate topping or a prepared caramel sauce (at room temperature)
and then sprinkling pecan halves or pieces on top. Refrigerate until
time to serve.

Milk Chocolate Ganache:

Combine cream, sugar and butter in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over
medium heat (do not let boil). Add chocolate chips. Whisk until
melted and thoroughly blended. Let cool. Drizzle ganache over cake
with a pastry bag or a spoon.

Served at the Chicago 1996 Democratic National Convention.
