to a bowl. Repeat to brown the remaining beef, using 2 more Tbls of

Add the remaining Tbls of oil to the pan and then add the garlic,
onion, chiles, and bell pepper.  Cook, stirring, until the onion is

cumin, lime juice, and cornstarch then add to the pan.  Stir in the
tomatoes, then add the beef and accumulated juices; bring to a boil,
stirring. Season mixture to taste with the salt and pepper, then
transfer to a warm serving dish and keep warm.

Pit, peel and dice the avocado.  Spoon beef mixture into the warm
tortillas and offer the avocado, lime wedges, and sour cream to add
to the taste.
