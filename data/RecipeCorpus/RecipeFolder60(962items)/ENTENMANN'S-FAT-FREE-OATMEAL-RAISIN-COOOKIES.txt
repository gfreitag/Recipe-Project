1 tb Molasses
3    Raw egg whites
1 c  Dark raisins
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1 c  Light brown sugar -- packed
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Non-fat dry milk powder
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
2 1/2 c  Quaker brand quick-cooking
Rolled oats
1 c  All-purpose flour
Put molasses, egg whites and raisins into blender and blend on high
speed just to mince but not to puree (about 5-10 seconds). Empty
mixture into medium mixing bowl. With mixer beat in on medium speed
each of the remaining ingredients, beating well after each addition,
adding both the oats and flour in small portions. Switch to mixing
spoon if dough becomes too stiff for mixer. Lightly spray cookie
sheet with Pam and wipe off excess lightly with paper towel; any
excess of the cookie sheet may burn while cookies are baking. You
need only a very light film of the Pam just to keep cookies from
sticking. Use 1 measuring teaspoonful of dough for each cookie and
place 2" apart on prepared cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 350~ oven
6-8 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool on paper towels, removing from
cookie sheets carefully. Source: Gloria Pitzer
