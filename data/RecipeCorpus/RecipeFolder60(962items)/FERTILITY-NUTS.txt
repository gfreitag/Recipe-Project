Title: FERTILITY NUTS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 tb Butter
2 ts Dried Rosemary
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne Pepper
2 c  Walnuts
1.  Melt butter with the 2 teaspoons crumbled, dried rosemary, salt
and cayenne pepper. 2. Pour the mixture over the walnuts, tossing to
coat them. 3.  Bake the nuts on a cookie sheet at 250 degrees for 10
minutes.

They may be served before or after a meal for a finishing touch. I set
these out every Christmas Eve for my champagne/seafood open house
buffet and they're gone in a few hours.

Serves:  Never enough
