Title: FAMOUS FIDO'S HONEY PARTY COOKIES
Categories: Pets
Yield: 3 Dozen
1 c  Vegetable shortening; *
1 ts Unsalted butter; *
1/4 c  Egg whites
1/4 c  Honey
Food coloring; optional
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Garlic powder
1/4 c  Cheddar cheese; fine grate**
Sesame seeds; optional
* For even crunchier cookies, use only 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2
teaspoon unsalted butter

** The Famous Fido commercial baker uses Cheddar cheese powder

1. In a large bowl, beat shortening and butter with an electric mixer
at high speed until creamy. Add egg whites and honey; beat until
smooth. Beat in food coloring, if desired.

2. Combine flour, garlic powder and cheese. Beat into shortening
mixture. Stir in more food coloring if you like.

3. Gather dough into a ball. Divide it in half, then in fourths and
so on until you have 36 small pieces. Flour your hands and roll the
pieces into balls. (Or, use a pastry bag to shape the cookies.) Place
them on an ungreased cookie sheet, then use a floured fork to gently
flatten them in a crisscross design. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if
desired.

4. Bake in a preheated 325'F oven until firm, about 10 minutes. (To
make the cookies crunchier, after baking we turned off the heat and
left them in the oven about 5 minutes, first running a spatula under
each one so they wouldn't stick to the pan.)
