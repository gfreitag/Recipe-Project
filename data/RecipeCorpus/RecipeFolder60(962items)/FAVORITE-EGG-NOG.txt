Title: FAVORITE EGG NOG
Categories: Beverages, Eggs, Alcohol
Yield: 30 Servings
24    Eggs, separated
2 c  Sugar
1 qt Bourbon
2 c  Brandy
1 qt Heavy cream
2 qt Milk
1 qt Vanilla ice cream
Nutmeg
Beat egg yolks and sugar until thick. Add Bourbon and Brandy and stir
thoroughly. (The liquor "cooks" the eggs.) Add cream and milk and
continue whipping. Break up the ice cream and add. Beat egg whites
until stiff and fold in. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before
serving. Sprinkle lightly with nutmeg. NOTE1: This is fairly potent
and deceptively smooth, so you might wish to
cut back on the Bourbon and Brandy a little. NOTE2: If you can
get it where you are, then the only ice cream to use in
this recipe is on of the following BLUE BELL CREAMERY flavors -
Natural Vanilla Bean, Homemade Vanilla, or French Vanilla.
NOTE3: Any good bourbon or sour mash will do, but Old Forester seems
to add
a special something to the taste. As for the brandy, don't
waste the
VSOP, but don't use that buck-fifty-a-liter varnish remover
that you
picked up on that last trip to Tijuana, either.
