Title: ELEGANT APPLE DUMPLING
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 4 Servings
Dough:
1 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Butter
1 tb Shortening
1/4 c  Apple juice or apple cider
Filling:
4 tb Butter
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Crushed gingersnaps
1/4 c  Ground pecans
1 tb Grand Mariner
1 ts Cinnamon
Mix flour, cinnamon, salt, butter and shortening until a crumbly
mixture forms. Add in the juice slowly, until a smooth dough forms.
Melt butter, and mix the rest of the ingredients into it.

Putting it all together: Core 3/4 of an apple (preferably a Granny
Smith) making sure that there is plenty of room for the filling. Roll
out the dough, the thinner the better. Wrap dough around the apple.
Squeeze off the excess and create leaves for the top of the apple
with the extra. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 20 minutes
until dough becomes a light to golden brown. It will not get too dark
so definitely keep checking on it.

The dough recipe should yield enough for two apples. To make a stem
for the apple use a small piece of cinnamon stick
