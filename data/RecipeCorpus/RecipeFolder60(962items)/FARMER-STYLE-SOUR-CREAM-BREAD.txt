2 1/2    To 3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda

-optional
Makes 1 loaf

Directions: Combine water, sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve yeast
and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure 2 cups of the flour, salt
and soda into work bowl.  Process on/off to mix.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

Spoon sour cream evenly over flour mixture.  Turn on processor and add
enough of the remaining flour through feed tube so dough forms a ball
that cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around
bowl about 25 times.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Shape into a ball and place
on greased cookie sheet.  Flatten with hands into a circle about 8
inches in diameter.  Brush dough with oil. Sprinkle sesame or poppy
seeds over dough, if desired.  Let stand in warm place until doubled,
about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Bake until golden, 25 - 30 minutes.

Remove from cookie sheet.  Cool on wire rack.
