Title: ENGLISH GINGERED BRANDY SNAPS (KH)
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Brandy
2 tb Light corn syrup
1 ts Molasses
1/2 c  All purpose flour
1/2 ts Ground ginger
Filling
1 c  Whipping cream, whipped
1 tb Sugar
Combine butter, sugar, corn syrup, and molasses in a medium saucepan.
Heat mixture over medium heat just until butter is melted. Combine
flour, ginger and nutmeg in a small bowl. Stir this mixture into the
butter mixture. Stir in the brandy. Drop the mixture by teaspoonfuls
6 inches apart on greased cookie sheets. Bake at 350F 8 to 10
minutes. Let cool for 30 seconds. Ease cookies off the cookie sheets
with a spatula; then immediately roll loosely around a 6-inch tapered
metal tube with the upper surface of each brandy snap on the outside.
Cool on wire racks. Shortly before serving, whip cream, add sugar,
and mix well. Using a pastry bag fined with a star tip, fill the
cavity in the rolled brandy snap from each end.

Note: If brandy snaps begin to harden before they are rolled, return
them to the oven for 30 seconds to soften them.
