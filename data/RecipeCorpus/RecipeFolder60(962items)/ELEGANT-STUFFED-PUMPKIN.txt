Title: ELEGANT STUFFED PUMPKIN
Categories: Vegetables, Oct.
Yield: 5 Servings
1    5-pound pumpkin
2    To 3 cups brown rice,
Cooked
2 c  Crumbled dry whole wheat
Bread (or part corn bread
Etc ) I used bread
Crumbs and corn meal.
1    Onion, chopped
1/2    To 1 cup chopped celery and
Leaves
2    Apples (tart and unpeeled),
Chopped
1 c  Roasted chestnuts or a
Andful of cashew nuts, cut
In half.
x  Herbs: Sage, savory,
Marjoram, oregano, and
Paprika to taste. I used
About a teaspoon
Each
1    To 2 cups vegetable stock
1/4    To 1/2 cup butter, melted,
Or safflower oil.
[ed ...Necessary?]
Soy sauce or salt to taste.
Cut off top of pumpkin to make a lid. Remove the seeds and scrape out
any stringy pulp. Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and
mix well with hands. Add stock and butter, and mix well, adding soy
sauce and salt if desired. Stuffing should be moist but not wet. Pack
loosely into pumpkin, replace lid, and bake on oiled cookie sheet for
1 1/2 hours or more at 325 F. It is done when a fork pushes easily
through the pumpkin. Transfer to a caserloe dish and serve at the
table, scooping out some of the tender pumpkin flesh with each
serving of stuffing. If the pumpkin is organically grown, you may eat
the skin too. (If you have too much stuffing for your pumpkin, place
extra in an oiled casserole, cover, and bake for 1 hour.)
