In large pot, boil chicken in water to cover until tender; reserve 2
cups broth.  Debone and dice chicken. Add chicken, tomatoes, onion,
salt and garlic to reserved broth; boil 10 minutes or until reduced
enough for enchilada filling.  Strain. Heat a bit of oil in a small
skillet; press each tortillas into the hot oil a few seconds to
soften them and make them more pliable to roll. Stuff with chicken
filling. Roll filled tortillas and place in baking dish. Cover
one-third of the enchiladas (longways) with salsa verde, the center
third with the sour cream, and the final third with salsa colorado.
The result should resemble the Mexican flag. Bake at 375 degrees
until thoroughly heated, about 25 minutes.

Salsa colorado:  Wash chiles, stem and seed. Cook in boiling water to
cover well 10 mins. or until soft. Remove and drain. Reserve liquid.
Place chiles in blender with reserved water, and whirl until you
achieve a pasty consistency. Heat oil in large skillet. Add garlic
and flour and cook, stirring until flour browns. Add chile paste
slowly to mix well with flour to a smooth paste. When all the chile
paste is added, bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook until it
thickens, 3-4 minutes. Thin with water to a thick, saucy consistency.

Salsa verde:  Boil tomatillos in small amount of water until tender;
blend in food processor. In skillet, saute onions in oil. Add pureed
tomatillos, salt and garlic.
