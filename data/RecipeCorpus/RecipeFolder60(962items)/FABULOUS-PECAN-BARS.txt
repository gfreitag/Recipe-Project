Title: FABULOUS PECAN BARS
Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 5 Servings
1/2 c  Butter -- cold
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Ice water
------FILLING-----
1 1/2 c  Light brown sugar -- packed
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Honey
1/3 c  Sugar
1 lb Pecans
1/4 c  Whipping cream
Use a pastry blender to cut butter into the flour. Mixture should
resemble cornmeal. Add water and toss with a fork. Gather dough into
a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Butter
and flour a 9x13" pan. Roll dough out to about an 11 by 15 rectangle.
Fit dough into the prepared pan and let it come up about an inch on
all sides. Pierce dough with a fork. Chill while making the filling.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine brown sugar, butter, honey, and
sugar in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat,
stirring constantly. Boil until thick and dark, 3 or 4 minutes. You
must stir constantly. Remove from the heat. Stir in pecans and cream.
Pour over dough in pan. Bake 25 minutes. Check after about 15
minutes. If the filling is browning too much, reduce oven heat to 375
degrees and continue baking. Cool cookies in the pan. Cut into strips.

Makes 5 or 6 dozen.
