Categories: Main dish, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Salmon (1-pound) fillet
Vegetable cooking spray
1/8 ts Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Reduced-calorie margarine
3    Cloves garlic, minced
2 tb All-purpose flour
2 c  Skim milk
3/4 c  Grated fresh Parmesan
-cheese, divided
6 c  Hot cooked spinach

-salt or fat
1 Spinach pasta makes a prettier dish, but plain fettuccine will work
just as well.

2 Place salmon, skin side down, on a broiler rack coated with cooking
spray; place rack on a broiler pan. Sprinkle with pepper. Broil 5-1/2
inches from heat 11 minutes or until salmon flakes easily when tested
with a fork. Flake salmon into bite-size pieces; set aside, and keep
warm.

3 Melt margarine in a medium saucepan over medium heat; add garlic,
and saute 1 minute. Add flour; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly
with a wire whisk. Gradually add milk, stirring constantly. Cook an
additional 8 minutes or until slightly thickened and bubbly, stirring
constantly. Add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cheese; stir until cheese
melts. Pour over pasta, and toss well. Top with salmon; sprinkle with
remaining 2 tablespoons cheese.

Yield: 6 servings (serving size: 1 cup pasta and 2 ounces salmon).
