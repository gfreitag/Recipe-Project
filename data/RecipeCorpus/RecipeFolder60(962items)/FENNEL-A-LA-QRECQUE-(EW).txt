cup water.

Heat 1/2 T of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add half of the onions and half of the fennel; cook, stirring, until
the vegetables are limp and starting to color, about 10 minutes. Pour
in half of the chicken stock mixture, tuck the spice bag into the
vegetables and bring the liquid to a boil.  Cook over high heat,
stirring occasionally, until the fennel is tender and the sauce has
thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer
the mixture to a large bowl; reserving the spice bag.

Wipe out the skillet, pour in the remaining 1/2 T oil and repeat the
above steps with the remaining ingredients. Let cool and discard
