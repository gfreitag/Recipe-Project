1    Chicken
Olive oil
1    Chopped onion
250 g  Walnuts, coarsely ground
6 1/2    Pomegranates, juice only
1 sm Lemon, juice only
3 tb Brown sugar

This classic Persian dish was originally made with game birds, but is
fine with chicken - or duck if you prefer. With its scattering of
pomegranate seeds and walnuts it is very decora- tive.

Disjoint a chicken (or use chicken pieces) and brown in a little
olive oil in a heavy pan with a lid. Remove the chicken and set
aside. Brown a chopped onion in the remaining oil. Add 250 g very
coarsely ground walnuts and cook gently for a minute or so.

Add the juice of 6 1/2 pomegranates and 1 small lemon, 3 tablespoons
brown sugar, a teaspoon ground cinnamon and salt and pepper to taste.
Bring to a simmer and return the chicken to the pan. Cook gently for
1 1/2 hours until very tender.

Taste and adjust the sweet-sour balance if necessary. Serve over
steamed rice and scatter over the dish the seed sacs of the remaining
half pomegranate and a handful of coarsely chopped walnuts.
