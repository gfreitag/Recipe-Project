2 c  Matzah farfel
Cold water
2 tb Margarine or oil
2    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Sugar
1    Apple, pared, sliced/diced
1    Banana sliced
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
Grease for the pan
the COmplete Passover Cookbook, by Frances AvRutick.
In a small bowl, cover the farfel with cold water, drain
immediately. The farfel should be moist but not soggy. In a large
mixiing bowl, beat the eggs with the oil or margarine.Add the farfel.
Stir well. Add the apple or banana and the nuts. Gently mix. Pour the
into greased 8" square pan. Bake in a 350 oven until brown, 30-40
minutes. Serves 6-8.

This is the only recipe I have for this as it is not something I
make. I do think that there were other farfel kugel recipes earlier.
I would backdate and see if there are any still alive. Or post a note
to Elaine Radis who has collected the Pesach recipes on her meal
