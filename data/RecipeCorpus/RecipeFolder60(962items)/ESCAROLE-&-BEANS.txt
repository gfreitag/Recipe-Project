-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 c  Chicken broth
1 lg Head escarole; well washed
-and coarsely cut
2 tb Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves; minced
15 oz Can cannelloni beans
4    Fresh basil leaves; cut up
In a large saucepan place chicken broth and escarole, bring to a boil
and simmer for an hour.  Gently brown the garlic in the oil, then add
cannelloni beans with their liquid and heat thoroughly. Combine with
escarole and let simmer for 10 to 20 minutes.  Stir carefully with
wooden spoon.  This should have a soupy consistency (add a little
more broth, or water, if necessary). This is excellent with hot
pepper flakes, grated cheese, and hot Italian bread.
