Put a medium bowl in freezer. Cut pound cake into 1/2 inch slices. In
a second medium bowl, combine ricotta with 1/2 cup sugar. Remove bowl
from freezer and add the cream and beat with electric mixer on high
until it holds stiff peaks. With a rubber spatula, fold whipped cream
into ricotta mixture. Fold in chocolate chips. Line bottom of a deep
glass serving bowl with slices of pound cake, cutting the cake as
needed to cover the bottom. Stir remaining sugar into coffee. Dip
pastry brush in the coffee and dab cake until it is soaked through.
Using a rubber spatula, spread 1/4 of the ricotta mixture gently over
the first layer of the cake. Arrange another layer of cake over the
ricotta mixture and use pastry brush to soak it with coffee. Cover
cake with another layer of ricotta mixture. Repeat until you have 4
layers of each, ending with the ricotta layer. Cover and refrigerate
for at least 4 hours. Sprinkle cocoa powder on top before serving.
