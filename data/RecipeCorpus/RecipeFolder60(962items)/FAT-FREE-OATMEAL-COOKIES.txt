Title: FAT-FREE OATMEAL COOKIES
Categories: Cakes, Fat free
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Light corn syrup
1/4 c  Water
1 ts Vanilla extract
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 c  Rolled oats
2 c  Oat bran
1 c  All-purpose flour (I use
Whole wheat)
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Raisins (golden are great!)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix all moist ingredients and sugars in
a large bowl, then gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Mix in
raisins. Drop by large spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet lightly sprayed
with Baker's Joy.  Bake 15-17 minutes or until the edges are browned.

These are great warm, but will break your teeth when cold.
