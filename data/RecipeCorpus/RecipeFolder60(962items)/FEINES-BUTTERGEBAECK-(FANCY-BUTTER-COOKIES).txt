((*Note:  The German original used the '#' for pound. Some of the
recipes from this source were in German, some in a mixture of German
and English. Since this particular recipe was all in German, I assume
it refers to German pounds.  A german pound - 500 grams - is slightly
larger than the American pound - 454 grams. K.B.))
