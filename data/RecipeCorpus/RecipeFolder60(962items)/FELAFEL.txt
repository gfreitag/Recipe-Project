Title: FELAFEL
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Cooked chickpeas
2 c  Soaked 1.5 hours,
-boiled until very soft
2    Beaten eggs
3    Cloves garlic (crushed)
1/2 c  Finely minced scallions
1/2 c  Finely minced celery
1/2 ts Ground cumin
3 tb Tahini
1/2 ts Tumeric
3 tb Flour
1/4 ts Cayenne
Dash black pepper
1 1/2 ts Salt
Mash chickpeas well (make sure they are cooked well enough to be
mashable). Combine with other ingredients. Chill well. With floured
hands, make the batter into one-inch-diameter balls. Dust each one
lightly with flour. Heat a two inch pool of oil in heavy skillet to
365 degrees. Deep fry felafel until golden brown, serve immediately.
MY MODIFICATIONS: I usually use 1-2 tsp of cayenne because I like
them spicy. I usually heat the oil in my wok and then drop the batter
into the wok by spoonfuls. Don't put too many in the wok at a time or
the temp. will drop. I peel, seed and slice cucumber, cube tomato and
grab a bunch of alfalfa sprouts and tuck them into a pita with some
ranch dressing----- ---
