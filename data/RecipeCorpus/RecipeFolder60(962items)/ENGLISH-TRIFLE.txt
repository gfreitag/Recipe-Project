Have you got a recipe for Low Cal English Trifle? Just in case---

(Takes up to two days to prepare properly)

Break angel cake in medium size pieces, spread each with small amount
of Raspberry Jam, arrange in straight sided glass bowl. Pour over the
sherry and weight down lightly with saucer and cover with plastic
wrap, set aside for a few hours.  After sherry has been absorbed, mix
Jello according to directions, do not use ice. Pour over cake and
sherry in the bowl. Cover and place in refrigerator for several hours
or overnight until jello is set.  Before serving, prepare Vanilla
Pudding mix and pour over top of jello, using a knife to slide down
sides of bowl to allow some of the pudding to go down sides.  Cover
and chill again. Garnish with cherries and mint, or use some of the
candied holiday fruits to decorate top of bowl. When serving, be sure
to slide spoon to the bottom of the bowl for each serving, not only
for the colors of the different layers, but to be sure each serving
gets the flavor of the sherry. Top with a small dollop of Cool Whip
Lite.

If you're not watching sugar content or calories, the same recipe can
be made with regular jam, regular jello and regular pudding mix.
Looks best in a straight sided glass bowl. This has been a family
favorite for Christmas since my childhood.
