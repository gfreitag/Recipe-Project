Gayle Schuck of Bismarck, North Dakota, waxes nostalgic at the
thought of family picnics at LaMoure County Memorial Park in Grand
Rapids, North Dakota. The James River encircles the park and its
tennis courts, ball diamond and playground, including the old,
squeaky merry-go-round. Brown sugar and bacon season Gayle's baked
quartet of canned pork and beans, butter beans, kidney beans, and
green beans.

1.  In a dutch oven, cook bacon and onion till bacon is browned and
onion
is tender.  Drain off the fat.

2.  Stir in the remaining ingredients.  Transfer the mixture to a 3
1/2 or
4    quart crockery cooker.

3.  Cover; cook on low heat setting for 6 hours. Makes 10-12 servings.

Oven Method:  In a medium skillet, cook bacon and onion till bacon is
tender.  Drain off fat.  In a 2 quart baking dish, combine th bacon
mixture with remaining ingredients. Cover and bake in a 350 deg. oven
for 30 minutes.  Uncover and bake for 15 minutes more.

Picnic Hint:  Leave the beans in the crockery cooker container or
baking dish.  Place the cooker in an insulated cooler or wrap in
towels to keep warm for the trip to your favorite picnic spot.

Gayle Schuck of Bismarck, N.D. often adds a pound of cooked and
drained lean ground beef to this hotdish. Or take along fully cooked
bratwurst to heat on the grill.
