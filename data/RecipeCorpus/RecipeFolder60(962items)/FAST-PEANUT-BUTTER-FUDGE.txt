Title: FAST PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE
Categories: Desserts, American
Yield: 1 Lb
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Peanut butter
1 ts Vanilla extract
3 tb Cocoa (optional)
Mix sugar, 1/2 cup water, and optional cocoa in a saucepan, and boil
rapidly for exactly one minute. Pour over peanut butter and vanilla
in a bowl, and beat until thick. Pour into buttered pan and allow to
cool. Cut into squares. This recipe starts out as peanut-butter
fudge, but with the addition of powdered cocoa, can apparently been
engineered to be chocolate. I've not tried the cholocate variation,
but the basic pb is so good and so easy that its certainly worth the
try...
