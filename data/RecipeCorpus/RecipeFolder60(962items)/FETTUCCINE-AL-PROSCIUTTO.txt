Title: FETTUCCINE AL PROSCIUTTO
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
6 oz Prosciutto
4 oz Butter
2 tb Minced onion
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 lb Fresh fettuccine
2/3 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
SEPARATE FAT AND LEAN parts of prosciutto. Chop fat coarsely; cut
lean into 1/2-inch squares. (If prosciutto has little or no fat,
simply increase butter by 1 to 2 tablespoons.) Melt butter in a
skillet. Add onion and prosciutto fat and saute 5 minutes. Add
prosciutto squares and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, salt very
lightly and pepper generously. With a slotted spoon, remove half the
prosciutto and reserve. Boil the fettuccine in a large quantity of
salted water 1-2 minutes, until al dente. Drain in a colander but not
too thoroughly: leave them a little moist. Transfer fettuccine to a
heated serving bowl. Toss with entire contents of saute pan. Add
grated cheese and more freshly ground pepper, and toss again. Strew
reserved prosciutto on top and serve at once.
