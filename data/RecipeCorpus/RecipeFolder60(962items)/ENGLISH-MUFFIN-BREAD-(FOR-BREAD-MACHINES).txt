Title: ENGLISH MUFFIN BREAD (FOR BREAD MACHINES)
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 c  Water
2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking Soda
3 c  Bread Flour
3 tb Nonfat Dry Milk
2 ts Yeast
Note: Ingredients are for Large Loaf (about 1.5 lbs), adjust # of
servings for Medium or Small loaf.
Put all ingredients in machine in the order suggested by your
machine's manufacturer and fire that bad boy up on the regular bread
cycle. The top of the loaf should come out sunken, this is normal.
The texture and taste is just like English Muffins, this is GREAT for
toasting!
