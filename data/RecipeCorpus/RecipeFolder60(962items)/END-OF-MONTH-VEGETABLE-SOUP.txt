Title: END-OF-MONTH VEGETABLE SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2    Chinese cabbage
1/2    Carrot
1/2    Red bell pepper
1    Yellow onion
4 sm Potatoes
1/8 lb Bacon pieces
-(for seasoning)
4    Prosciutto end bits
-(for seasoning, optional)
5    Stalks celery
1    Bouquet garni (e.g.,
-about 1 t each parsley
-and thyme, 1 or 2 bay
-leaves)
2    Chicken or beef bouillon
-cubes
2    Garlic cloves
Pepper (to taste)
1 c  White wine (optional)
Make the bouquet garni by tying the herbs up in a cheesecloth or
coffee filter.  Put a quart of water to boil with about 1/2 t salt (I
don't like to use too much salt if I use bouillon), the bouquet garni
and the bouillon.

Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and add these to the soup together
with the bacon and/or prosciutto ends. Bring this to a boil. Simmer 5
minutes. If scum forms on the surface, skim it off.

Dice the potatoes and add to the boiling pot.  Cut up everything else
and add it. Add the wine. Adjust the liquid so that it covers the
vegetables. After it boils again, adjust the seasoning and simmer for
about an hour, or until it is done (this is quite subjective).

NOTES:

*  Soup with a mixture of vegetables -- I had an eclectic mixture of
vegetables going bad in the refrigerator, so I collected them and
came up with this soup. It was very good, so I would like to share it
with you all. Caveat:  I rarely measure anything, so be careful of
quantities.

*  This will serve 6 people at once, or 2 people for three days. It
ages well in the refrigerator.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
