Title: FAT FREE FRIES
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Whole Idaho Baking Potatos
Scrubbed clean, skin on
x  Non Stick Spray
x  Onion Powder
x  Garlic Powder
x  Paprika
Spray cookie sheet with Non stick spray (I prefer the airbake kind,
the fries dont burn as easily).  Slice potatos into french fry shapes
lengthwise.  Positi on the fries on the cookie sheet leaving minimal
space in between each. Spray a th in layer of Non stick spray over
the top of the fries and sprinkle with onion powd er garlic powder &
Paprika. Broil for 5-7 minutes until crusty on the outside. Remove
from oven and turn the fries over.  Broil on second side for an
addition al 5-7 minutes. If the fries seem underdone, bake for
another 10 min or so at 350 degress. Remove from oven. Place on
serving platter & cover with a (paper ) towel or plate for 5-10 min
(this helps the fries to soften on the inside). Serve.

Another tip:  To get really great saute'd onions saute them with
watered down apple juice - no fat but good taste.
