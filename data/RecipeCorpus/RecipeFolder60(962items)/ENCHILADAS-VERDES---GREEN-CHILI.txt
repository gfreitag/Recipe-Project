Title: ENCHILADAS VERDES - GREEN CHILI
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Mexican, Chili
Yield: 4 Servings
12    Corn Tortillas
4 tb Oil Or Lard
1    Clove Garlic
1 tb Flour
4 c  Green Chili Sauce
1    Salt To Taste
2 c  Cheddar Cheese, Grated
1/4 c  Minced Onion
Fry tortillas in fat to soften.  Heat garlic in oil then discard
garlic. Blend flour into oil.  Stir in green chili sauce and heat
thoroughly. If mixture is too thick, add water. Add salt to taste.
Layer tortillas with sauce, minced onion and cheese on oven-proof
plates. Sprinkle cheese on top.  Use 3 tortillas for each serving.
Place in oven to allow cheese to melt. NOTE:  For a real New Mexican
touch place a poached or fried egg on top.  The egg seems to help
meld the flavors.
