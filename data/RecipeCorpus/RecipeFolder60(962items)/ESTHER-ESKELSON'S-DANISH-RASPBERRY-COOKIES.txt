Title: ESTHER ESKELSON'S DANISH RASPBERRY COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Scandinavia, Christmas, Chocolate, Jw
Yield: 8 Dozen
2    1 oz squares unsweetened
-chocolate
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg
2 c  Cake flour
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Milk chocolate or white
Chocolate chips or a mixture
1 c  Seedless raspberry preserves
Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over hot not boiling water.
Remove from heat and cool. Cream butter and sugar in a large bowl
until light. Add egg and melted chocolate; beat until fluffy. Stir in
cake flour, vanilla and salt until well blended. Cover and
refrigerate until firm, about 1 hr.

Preheat oven to 400. Lightly grease cookie sheets or line with
parchment paper. Divide dough into 4 equal parts and divide each part
into two pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 12" long on a lightly
floured board. The ropes should be about the thickness of a finger.
Place 2" apart on the prepared cookie sheets. With your finger tip,
make an indentation along the length of each rope. Bake 8 min or
until firm.

Meanwhile melt the chocolate chips in a small bowl over hot water. If
you are using both kinds of chocolate, melt separately. Stir until
smooth. Stir preserves and spoon them into a pastry bag fitted with a
1/4" tip. [You can use a plastic bag with a corner snipped off with
scissors.]

When you remove the cookies from the oven, press preserves down the
indentation in each cookie strip. Return to the oven for 2 min and
remove to wire racks. While cookies are still warm, drizzle melted
chocolate over the tops and cut into 1" diagonal pieces. Refrigerate
until the chocolate has set.

This recipe was learned by my mate Roslind many Christmases ago from
her first husband's grandmother, Esther Eskelson and has been a
family favorite ever since.
