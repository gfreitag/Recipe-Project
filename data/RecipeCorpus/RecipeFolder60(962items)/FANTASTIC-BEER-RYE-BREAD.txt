Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
Jim Vorheis
2 pk Dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water
2 1/2 c  Beer
1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Molasses (preferably dark)
1 tb Salt
1 tb Caraway seeds
5 c  Rye flour
4 c  All-purpose flour
1    Egg
Makes 2 long loaves or 3 round loaves. Sprinkle dry yeast in warm
water. Stir until dissolved.  Heat beer until it just starts to
bubble. Remove from heat and add shortening. Add molasses, salt and
caraway seeds to beer and stir. Cool until lukewarm and stir in
dissolved yeast. Beat in rye flour.  Beat in white flour until dough
is too firm to beat (you may not need it all).  Turn out onto floured
board.  Knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 10 minutes.  Put into
greased bowl and butter top of dough. Cover and let rise in warm
place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. On a lightly floured
board, knead again until smooth. Shape into 2 long loaves or 3 round
loaves. Slash top with very sharp knife several times. Brush with egg
that has been beaten with 1 tablespoon water. Let loaves stand until
doubled in bulk.  Brush again with beaten egg. Bake in preheated 350
F oven for 40 to 45 minutes.
