Title: FENNEL~ MUSHROOM & PARMESAN SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Garlic clove
1/4 ts Coarse sea salt
2 1/2 tb Lemon juice
2    Lemon peel strip; minced
1/8 ts Fennel seeds
- crushed under a spoon
- or in a mortar
5 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
8 oz Mushrooms, large, firm
- wiped clean
Pepper
1    Fennel bulb
1 tb Fennel greens, chopped
1 tb Italian parsley, chopped
Salt
3 oz Parmesan Reggiano; shaved
- into paper-thin slices
POUND THE GARLIC and the salt in a mortar until completely smooth.
Stir in the lemon juice, lemon peel, fennel seeds and olive oil to
make a tart, lemony vinaigrette. Thinly slice the mushrooms,
carefully dress them with a few tablespoons of the vinaigrette, and
season them with plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Lay a damp
kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap directly over them to keep
them from browning, and set aside for 1 hour to marinate. Trim the
fennel bulb and cut it into quarters. Remove most of the core; then
slice it lengthwise, very thinly, leaving the pieces joined together.
Dress it with most of the remaining vinaigrette and half the herbs,
and season with salt and pepper. Add the rest of the herbs to the
mushrooms. Layer the mushrooms, cheese and fennel on each plate and
spoon the remaining vinaigrette over the top.
