Beat eggs lightly. Add sugar and salt. Whisk in milk and coffee.
Grease 4 sturdy coffee cups or not-too-large mugs with butter. Don't
use grandma's bone china for this. Pour the custard mixture into the
cups. Put the cups in a large shallow dish. Add hot water to come up
about 1" on the sides of the cups. Bake at 325 degrees for about 40
minutes. Cool and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve right in
the cups with whipped cream and a little grated bittersweet chocolate
over the top.
