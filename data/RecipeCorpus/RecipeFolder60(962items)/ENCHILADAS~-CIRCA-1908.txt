Title: ENCHILADAS~ CIRCA 1908
Categories: Mexican
Yield: 12 Enchiladas
4 c  Pitted green or black
-olives, roughly chopped
3 c  Raisins
12 lg Flour tortillas
Chilisalya
1 lb Gouda cheese, shredded
The original recipe from Mrs. Robert Y. McBride, which appreared in
"The Los Angeles Times Cookbook Number Three" (1908), included
instructions for making tortillas - flour, rather than corn - because
they weren't yet available in stores.

The olive-and-raisin filling and the use of Gouda, instead of Mexican
cheese, were common at the time.

"Chilisalya" was clearly a misreading of a handwritten recipe for
chili salsa. Notice the use of tarragon vinegar, a seemingly modern,
though not particularly Mexican, idea.

Mix olives and raisins in bowl. In bowl, dip 1 tortilla in Chilisalya
and place on work surface. Put 1/12 of olive-raisin mixture on
tortilla, add 1 tablespoon Chilisalya and some cheese. Roll tortilla
up and place in baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.

Pour remaining Chilisalya on tortillas in baking dish and sprinkle
enchiladas with remaining cheese. Bake at
325    degrees 10-15 minutes.
