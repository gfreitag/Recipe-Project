Title: EVA'S BEANS
Categories: Beans, Mexican
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Pinto beans *
1 lg White onion, chopped
4    To 5 fresh tomatoes, peeled,
-seeded and chopped **
1 lb Lean bacon, cut into squares
1 tb Mexican oregano
1    Sprig Epasote
1 tb Ground cumin
12 oz Beer
Water ***
1 bn Cilantro, chopped
2    To 12 fresh jalapeno
-peppers, seeded, cut into
-fine slivers.
Salt to taste

*(NOT soaked, but rinsed well, and the rocks, etc.picked out) **
(substitute canned, if you like) *** to cover the beans by about 2
inches (you may need to add more HOT water as they cook)

In a large pot, put the beans, bacon, oregano and cumin. Add the
beer, and water.  Simmer until the beans are almost tender (maybe 1 -
1 1/2 hours). Add the tomatoes and jalapenos, and cook until beans
are fully tender. Add the cilantro, and re-heat for about a half
hour. Salt to taste.

These make a good basic bean.  If you want a bean soup, remove about a
quarter of the beans, and mash with a potato masher. Return to the
pot.

Eva insisted that these beans HAD to be consumed the same day they
were cooked.  I've found they will be almost as good reheated the
next day, and if drained of most of their liquid, they make killer
refried beans.

She served them as a separate course, after the meat ~- I like them
as an accompaniment to grilled or barbecued meat, or as a meal in
themselves, when served with a lot of fresh tortillas or homemade
bread.
