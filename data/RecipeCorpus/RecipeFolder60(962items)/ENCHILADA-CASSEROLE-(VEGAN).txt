Title: ENCHILADA CASSEROLE (VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1    Onion
x  Several cloves of garlic
1    16 oz. can crushed tomatoes
1 cn Chilis (I got the smallest
cn Green ones)
x  Oregano and basil to taste
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 c  Black beans
1 c  Whole wheat couscous,
Reconstituted
1/2 pk White Wave lowfat firm tofu,
Crushed (+ sauce)
x  Corn tortillas
Water saute the onion and garlic until brown, deglaze and continue
until they reach the condition you favor. Add tomatoes and chilis.
Add spices and salt and pepper to taste and simmer while you mess
with the rest of the ingredients  (Note: I would have added corn
here, had I had it).

Reconstitute couscous with hot water.  Stir together couscous, beans
and crushed tofu.  Add sauce to create a desirable consistency. (Be
sure to save enough sauce for the casserole).

Squirt a 9x13 pan with cooking spray and then put a bit of sauce in
the bottom and spread it around.  Heat a skillet to medium and use it
to soften the corn tortillas (put them on the skillet and flip them
when they get a bit hot; they should wind up soft). Roll about 2 to 3
tablespoons of the filling in each tortilla (while heating the one to
follow) and squeeze them tightly side by side in the pan. Cover the
rolls with remaining sauce when you're done.

Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes and then let stand for ten
minutes.

Note: since I always cook for me and one fat-loving ovo-lacto
vegetarian (we just got engaged!), I made extra of everything (so
don't take my proportions as absolute) and filled two 8x8 pans,
rather than one 9x13. I then added extra stuff to his pan of
enchiladas, leaving my pan pristine. This is the way I always make
lasagna too; one pan with fatty stuff added to the vlf recipe for him
and the vlf version for me. Anyway, I loved my enchiladas, and he
gave his an 8 out of 10.
