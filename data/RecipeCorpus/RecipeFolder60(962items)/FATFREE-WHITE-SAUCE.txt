Title: FATFREE WHITE SAUCE
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Soy or rice milk
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 tb Parsley Patch seasoning
1/4 ts Garlic powder
2 tb Cornstarch
Heat 1 1/2 cups soy or rice milk, add soy sauce and seasonings. Mix
the cornstarch with the remaining milk and add to the pot, stirring
constantly. It should thicken quickly. Cook on low heat about few
minutes, stirring. It holds well if the rest of dinner isn't quite
ready.

The McDougall recipe puts the cornstarch in 1/4 cup water, but for a
gravy you don't need the extra liquid.
