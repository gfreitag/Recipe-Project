Title: F/F PUMPKIN CREAM CHEESE PIE (LACTO OVO)
Categories: Digest, Nov., Powter
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 pk Phyllo dough
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
8 oz F/f cream cheese
1 cn Pumpkin
3 tb Skim milk
4    Egg whites
2 tb Pumpkin pie spice
1/4 c  Maple syrup or honey
1 tb Vanilla
Crust: I just unrolled it out of the package, layed it on top of the
pie dish that I'd sprayed with Pam and pressed it in. I used kitchen
scissors and cut off the excess.

Mix everything in a blender and pour into crust.  I only have a deep
dish pie plate, so I doubled this recipe (I actually made 2 seperate
batches). I brushe d the crust with skim milk, wrapped aluminum foil
around the edges and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. When I take it
to my mother's house tomorrow, I will brush the edges again, and
probably bake it for 15 minutes, just to brown the crust.
