Cecila came up with this combination for actress Darryl Hannah, a
vegetarian who cooks for meat eaters. The Philippines-inspired cold
tomato and lime dressing is compatible with grilled fish or chicken
as well as mushrooms.  To prevent the bamboo skewers from splintering
in the heat of the fire, soak them in cold water for about half an
hour and place them in the freezer for a few minutes before cooking.

Combine all marinade ingredients in a glass or ceramic bowl. Add the
mushrooms, toss to coat and set aside to marinate for 1 hour at room
temperature.
