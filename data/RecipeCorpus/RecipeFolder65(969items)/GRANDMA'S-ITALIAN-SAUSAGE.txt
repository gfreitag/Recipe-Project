Title: GRANDMA'S ITALIAN SAUSAGE
Categories: Family, Italian, Sausage
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Ground pork
1 1/4 ts Salt
1 1/4 ts Fennel seeds
1/2    Red pepper
Combine ingredients and use sausage funnel to force into cleaned
casings OR form into patties or link shapes and cook until browned.
Excellent for use in your basic spaghetti gravy recipe. This is also
great just crumbled on top of pizza.  This recipe can be multiplied,
if you wish. I usually make 4-6 pounds at a time. It freezes well.
