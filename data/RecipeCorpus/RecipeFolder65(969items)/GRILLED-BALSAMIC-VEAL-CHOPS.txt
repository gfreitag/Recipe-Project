Title: GRILLED BALSAMIC VEAL CHOPS
Categories: Veal, Grill
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Shallots
2    Garlic cloves
2    Sprigs fresh rosemary
3 c  Balsamic vinegar; divided
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/2 ts Kosher salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
4    Veal chops; 10 oz each
1 c  Balsamic vinegar
4 ts Basil-infused oil
4    Sprigs fresh thyme (garnish)
To be served with Balsamic Ratatouille and Mashed Potatoes
w/Mascarpone Cheese & Roasted Garlic

1. Roughly chop shallots, garlic and rosemary. Place in a casserole
dish large enough to hold the veal chops, along with 2 cups balsamic
vinegar and the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add chops, cover, and
marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours.

2. Remove veal chops from marinade. Place on a hot grill. Cook at
medium temperature, turning once, for 9 to 13 minutes, until done to
your liking. If using a gas grill, the barbecue experts who staff the
Weber Grill Line (1-800-474-5568) recommend grilling the chops over
medium heat using the indirect method until chops reach 160 degrees
for medium and 170 degrees for well-done.

3. Meanwhile, reduce remaining 1 cup balsamic vinegar by placing it
in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring frequently, until
thick and syrupy, about 8 to 10 minutes. (Do not let vinegar boil
rapidly or it will burn.) You will get about 4 teaspoons.

4. To assemble: On a warm plate, place 1/4 of the ratatouille in the
center of each plate. Place 1/4 of the mashed potatoes on top of each
serving of ratatouille. Drizzle 1 teaspoon basil oil over each
serving of potatoes. Lay grilled chops over potatoes and drizzle 1
teaspoon reduced balsamic vinegar over each. Garnish with thyme
sprigs.
