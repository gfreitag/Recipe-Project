Title: GREEN-AND-GOLD RELISH
Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Chinese, Relishes
Yield: 1 Recipe
10 oz Greens; Spinach -OR-
-- Garland chrysanthemum
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Cider vinegar
-OR- Chinese dark vinegar
1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
NOTE: Buy 11 ounces of greens (if stems of garland chysanthemum are
thick, buy 14 ounces) in order to have 10 ounces after trimming.
Include stems of both vegetables; however, if garland chysanthemum
stems exceed 1/4 inch in thickness, do not use them for this recipe
since they may be too firm, tough, or stringy.

Wilt the greens by immersing them in a large pot of boiling water for
30 seconds (or steam in a vegetable basket, 1-1/2 minutes for
spinach, 2-1/2 minutes for garland chysanthemum, stirring once or
twice).

Rinse in cold water to stop the cooking.  Divide into two or three
bunches and firmly squeeze out the water. Chop each handful at
1/2-inch intervals, then turn and chop in a cross direction. Squeeze
again if the greens are still watery, then loosen them by a light
crumbling motion and place in a bowl.

Pour boiling water over the bamboo shoot to freshen it; rinse under
cool water and dice finely (1/4 inch thick).

Toss all ingredients together.  Let sit a few minutes at room
temperature, and test for seasonings, adding perhaps an extra 1/4
teaspoon sugar with garland chysanthemum. Serve chilled or at room
temperature.
