inches.  Brush lightly with butter. Combine 3/4 cup sugar and
cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over the two oblongs. Roll up as for jelly

8-inch layer pans. Combine brown sugar and nuts and sprinkle evenly
over melted butter in pans. Place rolls, cut side up in pans. Cover.
Let rise in warm place until double in bulk, about one hour.  Bake in
moderate oven (350 F) for about 30 minutes. Invert pan and allow pan
to stay over rolls for a minutes so syrup runs down sides of rolls.
