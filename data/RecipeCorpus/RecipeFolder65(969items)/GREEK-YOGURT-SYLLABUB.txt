For those who love stem ginger, this is a real treat: a
lemon-flavoured base of thick Greek yogurt for the ginger, topped
with a garnish of fresh peaches. Scrumptious.

Whisk the yogurt and stir in the brandy or lemon juice. Fold in the
chopped ginger and syrup, and sweeten to taste if necessary. Spoon
into two or three serving glasses. Chill thoroughly for at least 4
hours, or overnight.

Serve garnished with fresh peach slices.
