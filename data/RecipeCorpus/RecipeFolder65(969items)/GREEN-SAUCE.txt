Green sauce has been made for centuries by crushing seasonal herbs and
greens with a mortar and pestle. It is traditional to use any seven
herbs and greens since seven is a lucky number.

Combine the ingredients in a blender or food processor and mix to
desired consistency.  Keep refrigerated.

This recipe is great mixed in with a hot baked potato or a creamy
sauce.
