Title: GRAPE LEAVES STUFFED WITH GOAT CHEESE & COU
Categories: Main dish, Eggs/cheese
Yield: 30 Servings
1    9-oz jar of grape leaves
1/3 c  Dry couscous
1 ts Ground cumin
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1 sm Tomato, seeded and cut into
-small dice
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
1 tb Olive oil, plus more for
-sealing and grilling
-stuffed grape leaves
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
2    7-oz logs goat cheese, cut
-into 1/4-inch disks
1. Rinse and separate grape leaves. Place in a large roasting pan and
cover with boiling water. Let sit until water has cooled somewhat.
Rinse in cold water and drain. Pat each leaf dry, clip off stem, and
layer between paper towels. Set aside.

2. In a small saucepan, combine couscous, 1/3 C boiling water, and
cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and let stand until
couscous is soft and fluffy when stirred with a fork, about 5 minutes.

3. Transfer couscous to a medium bowl and add tomato, parsley, 1 T
oil, and lemon juice. Toss together and add salt and pepper; the
couscous should be slightly overseasoned.

4. Lay out 10 grape leaves at a time on a clean work surface. Place a
goat-cheese disk 1 inch from each stem end. Mound a heaping t of
couscous over goat cheese. Fold stem end over filling, then fold
sides of leaf over. Dab edges with olive oil to help seal. Fold top
of leaf over folded sides and dab with oil again. Place on a plate,
folded side down, layered between waxed paper. (Leaves can be
prepared up to this point in advance and stored, refrigerated,
overnight.)

5. Heat grill or nonstick pan. Brush stuffed leaves with olive oil and
place on grill or pan smooth side down. Grill or saute until browned,
about 2 minutes. Turn carefully and continue cooking until cheese is
soft and filling is heated through, about 2 minutes more. Serve
immediately.
