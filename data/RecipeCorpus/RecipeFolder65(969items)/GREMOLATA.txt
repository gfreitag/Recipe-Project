Title: GREMOLATA
Categories: Condiments, Fruits, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Italian
Yield: 1 Batch
2/3 c  Finely chopped fresh parsley
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 1/2 tb Grated lemon rind*
*I coarsely chopped some I'd frozen, and processed in a
mini-Cuisinart. Took about 3 pieces.

Combine and mix all ingredients together thoroughly. Best if made at
least 30 minutes in advance, to allow flavors to blend.

Yield: 2/3 cup.

Note: This stuff is delicious!  I keep some on hand most of the time.

Ogden writes: "A traditional Italian condiment, we love it as a quick
and healthy topping for lightly buttered baked potatoes, plain
broiled chicken, or any mild-flavored veal dish." (Would also be good
on fish or French bread, and possibly grilled hamburgers.)
