Title: GRAPE JUICE
Categories: Beverages, Canning, Fruits
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 24-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 16 pounds per canner load of 9 pints. A lug
weighs 26 pounds and yields 7 to 9 quarts of juice--an average of
3-1/2 pounds per quart.

Quality: Select sweet, well-colored, firm, mature fruit of ideal
quality for eating fresh or cooking.

Procedure: Wash and stem grapes. Place grapes in a saucepan and add
boiling water to cover grapes. Heat and simmer slowly until skin is
soft. Strain through a damp jelly bag or double layers of
cheesecloth. Refrigerate juice for 24 to 48 hours. Without mixing,
carefully pour off clear liquid and save; discard sediment. If
desired, strain through a paper coffee filter for a clearer juice.
Add juice to a saucepan and sweeten to taste. Heat and stir until
sugar is dissolved. Continue heating with occasional stirring until
juice begins to boil. Fill into jars immediately, leaving 1/4-inch
headspace. Adjust lids and process according to the recommendations
in Table 1.
