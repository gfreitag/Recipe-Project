Title: GREAT GLUTEN TURKEY
Categories: Vegetarian, Holiday
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2    Yard, cheesecloth
2 tb Poultry flavoring mix
1 1/2 c  ;water
1 tb Soy margarine or oil
2 tb White wine or gluten stock
2    Sheets,bean curd sheet--
-aka yuba
2 c  Dressing of choice
MMMMM---------------------------GLUTEN--------------------------------
5 oz (fl) Vital wheat guluten flr
1 oz (fl) whole wheat pastry flor
1 tb Poultry flavoring mix
5 oz ;water
Mix the flours, water and flavor mix. Dough should be firm, add more
flour if it is not. Roll the gluten out into a rectangle, place on
the spread-out cheesecloth and loosely fold edges over it to meet in
the middle (this is to keep it from getting glued to itself during
cooking). Then roll it up lengthwise (loosely to allow for expansion).

Tie the ends and and around the middle with string. Make sure you
allow for expansion to 2-3 times its original size.

Place this in a pot with the water and seasoning and bring to a boil,
then lower to simmering for 1 1/2 hours. Turn at least once during
cooking. This can be done two days in advance.

Prepare your dressing and remove the gluten from the stock (which
will be used for gravy). Unroll the gluten and fill with the dressing
or mound the dressing on the baking pan and tuck the gluten around it.

Reconstitute the bean curd sheets by soaking for 5 minutes in hot
water. They'll turn white and pliable but will be fragile. Cover the
cooked gluten roll with 2 or 3 layers of this. Brush the "turkey"
with the oil or melted soy margarine between layers and on top. Mix
the wine or stock with the remaining oil ormargarine and use this to
baste thile baking. Two T seasoning mix may be added to the stock for
more flavor.

Place in a pre-heated 350 degree oven and bake for 45 min to 1 hour,
basting every 15 minutes. If it begins to brown toomuch, cover
loosely with aluminum foil.

Carve and serve with stuffing.
