Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter a 9x55x3 inch loaf pan, dust with
the wheat germ and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the
raisins,milk, honey, sugar, and butter. Bring to a boil over moderate
heat. Pour over 1-1/2 cups of the cereal in a large bowl. Let cool 15
minutes. Sift the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
directly into the bowl; add the remaining 1/2 cup of cereal, eggs,
and vanilla. Stir with a heavy wooden spoon just until blended. Spoon
the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top. Sprinkle with
the remaining cereal. Bake until the loaf shrinks from the sides of
the pan and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.  About 1
hour. Loosely cover the top of the loaf with aluminum foil if it is
getting too dark druing baking. Cool the loaf in the pan on a wire
rack for 20 minutes. Carefully loosen around the sides of the pan,
then invert onto the rack and turn right side up. Cool completely.
Makes one loaf.
