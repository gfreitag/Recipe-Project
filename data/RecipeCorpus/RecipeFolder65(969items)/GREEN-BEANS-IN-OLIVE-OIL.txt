Title: GREEN BEANS IN OLIVE OIL
Categories: Side dish, Appetizers, Turkish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Green beans
1 md Onion, chopped
2 ea Chopped tomatoes
1 ts Salt
1/3 c  Extra virgin olive oil
3 1/2 ts Sugar
1/2-2 c water
Trim beans & cut into 3 pieces, wash & drain.

Put onion & tomato into a heavy pan.  Sprinkle with salt & rub in
lightly with fingers.  Stir in the beans, olive oil & sugar, mix
well. Cover & cook for 15 minutes over medium heat. Stir
occasionally. The beans will lose their colour & soften.  When all
the moisture has been absorbed, stir-fry the beans for 2 to 3
minutes. Add 1/2 cup water, cover & simmer for 40 to 50 minutes, till
the beans are tender.  Add more water if necessary, 1/2 cup at a
time.  When cooked, the dish should be very moist but not watery.
Serve cold as part of a buffet.
