Categories: Pickles
Yield: 10 Servings
2 cn Small beets (10 oz cans)
1/2 c  White vinegar
3/4 c  White sugar
Pinch of salt
Pinch of pepper
In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar to boil and add the sugar
slowly until dissolved - stir constantly. Open the cans of beets and
retain the juice from one can. Add the beets (whole) to the boiling
vinegar/sugar solution and bring back to a boil. Add the retained
beet juice (about 1/4 cup worth). Add salt & pepper. Boil for about 2
minutes and then remove from heat. Sterilize two sealing jars (about
10 ~ 12 oz capacity). Put beets into sterlized jars, cover with the
vinegar/sugar solution and seal with lids. Let stand several days
before serving. This is a sweet pickle best served cold.  Excellent
with beef and pork.
