This recipe was reduced from the original which was intended for
about 100 people, and called for 15 pounds of potatoes, 5 gallons of
water and other ingredients in the same grandiose proportions. The
above combination may be varied at will; just remember to use beer
instead of water to improve the flavours.

Combine the Cubed Veggies with the Miscellaneous stuff and cook until
the veggies are done.

Add the beef and cook another 5 minutes at low simmer.

Finally, add the Roux, stir well and cook over medium heat about 15
minutes.

To make the Roux, which is a thickening agent used around the world
and named by the French, you heat the oil on medium heat and add the
flour. Stirring constantly, slowly brown the mixture without burning
until it turns a nice chocolatey brown. Slowly add in the cold water,
stirring constantly until the consistency is smooth. When required,
add to the stew and blend in well with the thinner liquid. The 15
minutes at medium heat causes the flour to absorb a lot of the liquid
and thicken the stew.
