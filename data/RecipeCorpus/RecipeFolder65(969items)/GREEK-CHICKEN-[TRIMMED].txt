Categories: Poultry, Taverna, Dinner
5 lb roasting chicken, skinless
Yield: 6 Servings
1    lemon -- quartered
1/4 c  olive oil
salt and pepper
:
12    cloves garlic -- crushed
2 ts dried oregano -- plus
3 TB dried oregano
1/3 c  fresh lemon juice
2 ts cracked black pepper
6    boiling potatoes -- wedged
and chunked
:
1 c  water -- or
1/2 c  lowfat chicken broth -- as
needed
:
1/4 c  flatleaf parsley -- chopped

Consider placing sliced root vegetables (carrots, turnips) and onions
in the bottom of the pan that will take the place of a rack and add
flavors. Roasting at two oven temperatures gives chicken a crispy
outside, and a moist inside. Heat oven to 400 degrees. * Rinse
chicken and pat dry. Rub chicken inside and out with cut lemon
quarters, 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and
ground pepper. Place the lemon quarters,4 garlic gloves and 2
teaspoons oregano in the chicken cavity. Place chicken on rack in a
roasting pan. * In a small saucepan, combine remaining olive oil,
lemon juice, 2 tablespoons oregano, coarsely cracked pepper and 1
teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer3
minutes. Remove from heat. * Place potatoes and the remaining 8
garlic cloves around the chicken and sprinkle them with remaining 1
tablespoon oregano. Spoon a little of the lemon-oil mixture over the
chicken. Pour 1 cup water or broth evenly over potatoes and place in
oven. Roast 15 minutes. Baste chicken with some of the lemon-oil
mixture and reduce heat to 350 degrees. Roast, basting with lemon-oil
mixture every 10-15 minutes, until juices run clear when thigh is
pierced with a fork or an instant-read thermometer inserted in the
thigh, not touching bone, reads 180 degrees, about 1 1/4 hours. *
Transfer chicken to a warmed platter. If potatoes aren't golden,
raise heat to 450 degrees and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, adding more
water or broth if necessary to prevent sticking. Garnish with
parsley. Recipe from Taverna: Best of Casual Mediterranean Cooking by
