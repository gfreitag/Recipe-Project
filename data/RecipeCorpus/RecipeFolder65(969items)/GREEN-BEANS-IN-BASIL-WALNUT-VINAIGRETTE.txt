MMMMM------------------------VINAIGRETTE-----------------------------

*For presentation purposes, the author suggests putting the radicchio
or red cabbage leaves on individual salad plates and mounding the
green beans on top.

Bring water to a rolling boil.  Add green beans and cook until just
tender-crisp.  Pour immediately into a colander and pour ice water
over them to stop the cooking action. Drain well.

In blender or food processor, put the garlic, basil, salt and ground
pepper.  Pulse on and off, then add the mustard and vinegar. Pulse
until smooth.  Add the oil very slowly in a thin stream, with the
machine running, just until blended.

Put the beans in a serving bowl and pour the vinaigrette over them.
Toss to coat thoroughly. Garnish with scallions and walnuts.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
