olive oil, lemon juice, and pepper; pour over swordfish. Cover and
chill 1 hour.

Coat food rack with vegetable cooking spray; place on grill over
medium-high heat (350F to 400F). Remove swordfish steaks from
marinade, discarding marinade, and place on food rack. Grill
swordfish steaks, covered with grill lid, about 6 minutes on each

(Tuna is a good substitute for swordfish because of its firm texture.
It will not flake with a fork, but check for doneness after 4 minutes)
