Title: GREEN BEAN & TOMATO SALAD
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2/3 lb Green beans
16    Cherry tomatos
1 1/3    Garlic cloves
2/3 tb Mustard (Dry)
1/3 c  Yogurt (plain non-fat)
1 1/3 tb Lemon juice (fresh)
2/3 ts Sugar
3/16 ts White pepper
3/16 ts Salt
1. Have a bowl of ice water handy. Place the green beans in a
vegetable steamer and place them in a deep pot with water in the
bottom. Bring to a boil over high heat, covered, and steam the beans
for 5 minutes. Remove the steamer from the pot and plunge the beans
into the ice water to stop the cooking and set the colour.

2. Place the green beans in a mixing bowl and combine with the cherry
tomatos (washed and halved).

3. Whisk the remaining ingredients together until smooth and well
blended. Tos the dressing with the beans and tomatoes and serve
immediately.

NOTE: You can achieve an even more colourful look if you use half red
and half yellow cherry tomatoes. You can make the salad up to six
hours in advance and keep it refrigerated, tightly covered with
plastic wrap. The beans can be steemed up to a day in advanced;
however, do not add the cherry tomatoes or dress the salad longer
than six hours before serving.
