1 ts Meat Glaze (Bovril); OR
1 ts Broth Seasoning Mix
Reserved Marinade For Fillet
Red Wine Or Beef Broth; If
Needed
Buy a prime grade fillet, if possible, and trim it well. Fold and tie
the tail to the meat to form a roast of uniform thickness (or have
the butcher do it for you). Place the meat in a plastic bag. Mix the
wine, oil, onion, and herbs, blending well.  Pour over the meat,
close the bag tightly, and turn it to coat the meat with the
marinade. Place the bag in a dish and marinate the meat for 2 hours
at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.  Drain the
meat, reserving the marinade. Grill the meat 4 inches above hot
coals, turning to brown on all sides. This takes about 10 minutes of
undivided attention so you can put out any flash fires. Add damp
hickory chips or small hickory sticks. Move the meat to the edge of
the grill or cover the grill and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer for
rare, 20 to 25 minutes for medium rare. Slice and serve with the
mushroom sauce.

MUSHROOM SAUCE:

In a medium skillet, melt the butter and add the onion and garlic,
cooking until the onion is tender but not browned. Add the mushrooms
and cook, stirring gently now and then, until well saturated with the
butter and most of the juices cooked from the mushrooms have
evaporated. Stir in the meat glaze.  Add the reserved marinade and,
if needed, a few tablespoons of wine or broth to make a light sauce.
Serve with the grilled fillet.
