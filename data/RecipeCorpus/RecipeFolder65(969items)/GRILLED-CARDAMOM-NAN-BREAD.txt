Title: GRILLED CARDAMOM NAN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Envelope active dry yeast
1 1/4 c  Lukewarm water (110F-115F)
1 tb Honey
1 tb Olive oil + extra
3 1/2 c  Bread flour
1 tb Salt
1 tb Ground cardamom
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in the water and stir in the honey.
Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the 1 T oil, the flour,
salt and cardamom and stir until the dough forms a cohesive mass.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until
smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 pieces
and shape each piece into a ball. Set the balls on an oiled baking
sheet and brush with oil.  Cover loosely with plastic and let rise in
a warm place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours. (Dough can be
refrigerated overnight - punch down balls before proceeding)

On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball of dough to an 8-inch
disk.  Arrange them on 3 oiled baking sheets and let rest for 20
minutes.

Light a grill or heat a grill pan or cast-iron skillet. Brush each nan
lightly with olive oil and grill for about 1 minute, until golden on
the bottom and light bubbles form on the top. Turn and cook until
golden all over, about 1 minute.  Keep warm while you cook the
remaining nan.
