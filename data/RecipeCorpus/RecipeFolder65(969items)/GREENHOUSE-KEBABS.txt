Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Aubergine (eggplant)
1 lg Red or yellow pepper
3    Courgettes (baby zucchinis)
6 sm Onions
12 sm Cap mushrooms
MMMMM------------------------FLAVOURINGS-----------------------------
4 tb Lemon juice
4 tb Peanut oil
2 tb Honey
Coriander seed,coarse ground
Coarsely ground black pepper
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
2 1/2 oz Peeled onion
2    Garlic cloves
5 tb Peanut butter
2 tb Peanut oil
1 1/2 tb Honey
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Coriander seeds
3/4 ts Chili powder
2 ts Anchovy essence
Cut the aubergine and pepper into chunks; cut the onions into wedges;
slice the courgettes into 1-to 1-1/2-inch lengths; leave the
mushrooms whole. Mix together all flavouring ingredients.  Toss the
vegetables in the flavourings and marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
The sauce should be part-prepared well ahead.  Chop the onion and
garlic roughly, then whizz them in a food-processor or blender with
the coriander seeds. Add the chili, oil and anchovy essence and whizz
again. Add the peanut butter, lemon juice and honey and process once
more. Scrape the puree into a small saucepan, cover and set aside for
at least 1 hour before cooking.
Thread the vegetables on to skewers and grill under moderate heat
for 10-15 minutes, basting with the marinade liquid as necessary.
Meanwhile, add 5 tablespoons warm water to the pan of sauce and set
it over medium heat.  Cook at a steady bubble, stirring often, until
the sauce is hot and aromatic.  Reduce heat to a very low and cook
for a few minutes longer, adding more water if necessary to achieve a
good creamy consistency, and adjust seasoning to taste. Hand round
the sauce separately.
