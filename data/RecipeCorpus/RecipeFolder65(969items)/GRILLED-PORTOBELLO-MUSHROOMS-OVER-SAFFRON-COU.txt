DRESSING: Combine oil, garlic, cumin, lemon juice, vinegar, salt and
pepper in cup and whisk together. Makes about 1/3 cup.

MUSHROOMS AND COUSCOUS: Remove stems from mushrooms and reserve for
another recipe.  Clean mushroom caps with damp paper towel. Slice
caps 1/2 inch thick. Brush with olive oil. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Place mushrooms on grill over ash-covered coals. Grill
until tender and browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. (Mushrooms can
also be cooked on stove-top grill or under broiler.) Remove from heat
and set aside.

Heat remaining oil in small pan.  Add onion and saute until tender,
about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and saffron. Bring to boil and
stir to dissolve saffron. Stir in couscous. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Cover. Turn off heat and set pan aside until couscous is
tender and liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix
Dressing. Fluff up couscous with fork.

To serve, spoon couscous onto serving plate.  Top with mushroom
slices. Spoon on Dressing.  Toss before serving.
