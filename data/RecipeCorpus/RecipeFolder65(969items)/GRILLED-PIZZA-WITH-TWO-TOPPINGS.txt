PREPARE THE DOUGH: Place warm water in a small bowl, add yeast and
sugar, stir until dissolved; set aside for 5 minutes. Add cornmeal,
whole wheat flour and salt, beat to combine. Gradually add white
flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until dough is stiff. Transfer
dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.

Brush dough on all sides with olive oil and place in an oiled bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until double in bulk, about
1 hour. Punch dough down; if dough is sticky, knead in a small amount
of flour. Makes enough dough for four 12-inch pizzas.

BASIC GRILLING INSTRUCTIONS: Prepare a charcoal fire. When coals are
medium-hot, flatten pizza dough on an oiled surface to form a 10-12
inch round that is about 1/8-inch thick. Gently lift dough and drape
over grill surface just above the coals. Within a minute the dough
will cook and brown. As soon as the underside is crisp and grill
marks appear, pull the dough off the grill with tongs and flip over
to the edge of the grill, away from direct heat. Quickly brush cooked
surface with olive oil, add toppings...

TOPPING #1: PARMESAN, PEPPER, AND PROSCIUTTO Evenly distribute
Parmesan and Bel Paese cheeses over surface of grilled and oiled
pizza dough. Spoon tomato sauce over cheese. Scatter red pepper and
prosciutto over sauce. Continue with final grilling instructions...

TOPPING #2: TOMATO, OLIVE, JALAPENO AND MOZZARELLA TOPPING Evenly
distribute garlic on grilled and oiled pizza dough. Sprinkle with
cheese and spoon tomato sauce evenly over surface. Cover surface with
mozzarella slices and scatter jalapeno peppers over surface. Continue
with final grilling instructions...

FINAL GRILLING INSTRUCTIONS Drizzle surface of pizza with 1-2
tablespoons olive oil. Slide pizza back toward source of heat. Rotate
frequently with tongs until underside is brown and topping is bubbly
hot. Serve at once.
