Categories: New imports, Vegetables
1 TB fermented black beans, --
rinsed and drained
Yield: 4 Servings
:
1 TB garlic minced
1/2 ts fresh minced ginger
1 TB vegetable oil
1/2 lb lean ground pork
1/4 c  chicken stock
1 lb Chinese green beans, --
trimmed & blanched
:
2 TB soy sauce
2 TB water
2 ts cornstarch

In a small bowl, mash the black beans into the garlic and ginger. In a
large wok or saute pan heat the oil and cook the pork, stirring
occasionally until all the pink is gone--about 10 minutes. Then add
the mashed fermented beans and stock, mix together and cook for 2
minutes. Add the green beans, mix together and cook for 3 more
minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl mix together the soy sauce, 2
tablespoons of water and cornstarch until they form a paste. While
stirring pour the cornstarch mixture into the liquid in the bottom of
the wok. The liquid will thicken and as you toss the wok, coating the
beans. Taste and re-season with salt and pepper if needed
