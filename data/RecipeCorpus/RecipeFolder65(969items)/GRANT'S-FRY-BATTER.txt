Combine all ingredients except flour; blend well.  Dip fish or
seafood, (bass, crappie, oysters, frog legs, shrimp, etc) in egg
batter, then roll in flour.  Fry in moderately hot oil until golden
brown. If oil is too hot, batter will burn.  Vegetables are good in
this batter (eggplant, squash, etc)  Strip fish into thin strips
before dipping in batter. *Collection of Clarence Fontish*
