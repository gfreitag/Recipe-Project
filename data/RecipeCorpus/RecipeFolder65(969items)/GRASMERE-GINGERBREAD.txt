Title: GRASMERE GINGERBREAD
Categories: Breads, Ethnic
Yield: 18 Servings
1 lb Fine oatmeal
1/2 ts Baking powder
4 ts Ground ginger
1 pn Allspice
1/2 lb Pale muscovado sugar
1/2 lb Butter
2 tb Golden syrup
Line a swiss roll or baking tin measuring about 9 x 13 inches with
bakewell or greaseproof paper and grease it well. Stir the dry
ingredients together. Melt the butter and syrup over low heat, pour
on to the dry ingredients and stir well to make a fairly stiff
mixture. Spread the mixture evenly over the base of the prepared tin
and bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 25-30 minutes.  Do not be
alarmed by the fact that the mixture will look a little runny when it
emerges from the oven; this is normal. Mark the biscuits into fingers
or squares while still warm but leave in the tin until completely
cold.  Don't make the biscuits very big ~ they are chewy and very
filling. Good exercise for the jaws and high in calories. Source:
