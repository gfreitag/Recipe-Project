Title: GRANDMA'S OATMEAL BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
From: Gaye Levy DTXT63A
1 c  Water; boiling
2 1/2 tb Margarine
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Honey
1 tb Molasses, dark, unsulphured
1/2 c  Oats
1    Egg, extra large, lightly be
3 c  Bread flour
2 ts Yeast, sprinkled over flour
This is a very large loaf. On my Hitachi, it hit the top of the lid
while rising but it baked just fine. I found, however, that I needed
to use the "light" setting.
