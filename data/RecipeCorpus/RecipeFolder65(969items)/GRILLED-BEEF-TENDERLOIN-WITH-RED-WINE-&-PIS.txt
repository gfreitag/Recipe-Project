Categories: Beef, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Main dish, Nuts
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Beef or veal stock
2 c  Dry red wine
-- preferably Pinot Noir
1/2 c  Roasted garlic cloves
1/2 c  Chopped shallots
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1 ds Each salt and pepper
-- or to taste
1/4 c  Toasted pistachios; chopped
1/4 c  Toasted sunflower seeds
-- chopped
2 lb Beef tenderloin
-- cut in 8 oz. steaks
2 tb Olive oil or corn oil
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
4    Fresh parsley sprigs
Preheat grill or broiler.

To make Red Wine Sauce:  In a large saucepan, combine the stock, red
wine, 3 tb. of the roasted garlic, shallots and 1/4 cup of chopped
parsley. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook until reduced to
coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a blender;
puree until smooth. Strain through a fine sieve into another
saucepan, then adjust the salt and pepper.  Stir in the remaining
parsley; reduce heat to low.

In a small bowl, combine the remaining garlic, pistachios, sunflower
seeds and 2 tb. of the Red Wine Sauce. Mix well. Rub the surface of
the steaks with the oil.

Grill steaks until well-seared on the surface, about 5 minutes. Turn
over and cook until you reach desired doneness, about 4 minutes for
medium-rare, depending on the thickness.

Brush tops of steaks with a small amount of Red Wine Sauce, then
press the steaks, top side down, into the pistachio mixture, coating
the surface well.  Position the steaks on serving plates, spoon the
remaining sauce around them, garnish with parsley sprigs and serve.

Note:  The nut garnish/topping can be added to the sauce, just before
adjusting the salt and pepper.
