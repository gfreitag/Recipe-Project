For the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add
the shrimp and marinate for about 3 hours. (Note the recipe states to
marinate at room temperature, but I would not leave it out for that
amount of time. The safest thing to do is to marinate in the
refrigerator.)

When the marinating time is over, make the vegetable saute. In a
saute pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the vegetables and
garlic; saute for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Season with salt
and pepper. Add the balsamic vinegar and continue cooking for 1
minute more.

To make the citrus vinaigrette, combine all the ingredients in a
mixing bowl.  Whisk to dissolve the honey.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade and grill or broil for 2 minutes
on each side.

Divide the sauteed vegetables among 6 salad plates, put 3 shrimp on
top of each, and pour on the citrus vinaigrette.
