pink; drain. Stir in papaya and pineapple. Heat, stirring
occasionally, until hot. Warm tortillas:  Heat in a hot, ungreased
skillet or griddle for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. They also can be
warmed in a 250 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Or wrap several
tortillas in dampened microwavable paper towels or microwavable
plastic wrap and microwave on High for 15 to 20 seconds. Heat oven to
425 degrees.  Spoon about 1/4 cup of the pork mixture onto half of
each tortilla; top with about 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Fold
tortillas over filling. Arrange five of the filed tortillas in
ungreased jelly roll pan, 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1 inch; brush with melted
margarine. Bake uncovered about 10 minutes or until light golden
brown. Repeat with remaining tacos.  Serve with papaya salsa.
