Title: GRANNY'S FUDGE
Categories: Desserts, Candies
Yield: 1 Pan
Brown sugar
Top milk
Butter
Vanilla
Okay - this is from an old cookbook, and you probably shouldn't try
to make it unless you know how to cook fudge well. Of course, this is
the only fudge I've ever made, and I get pretty good results.
Obviously, variations can be made by adding chocolate or liquid
flavors.

Place brown sugar in pot.  Add just enough top milk [WHAT is top milk
~ I used the heaviest cream I could find] to moisten. Stir with a
wooden spoon while melting over low heat. Bring to a boil without
stirring. When big bubbles form, test for soft ball stage in cold
water. Remove. Add blob of butter [dontcha just LOVE these exact
measurements]. Cool 10 minutes. Add a capful of vanilla and beat hard
until a gloss appears and then goes. Pour into a greased pan. Put on
the porch to cool.
