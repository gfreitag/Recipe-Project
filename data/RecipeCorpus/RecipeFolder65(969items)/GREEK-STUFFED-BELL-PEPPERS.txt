Title: GREEK STUFFED BELL PEPPERS
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Red or yellow bell peppers
3 c  Part-skim ricotta
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 c  Feta cheese, crumbled
1    Egg, lightly beaten
2 ts Oregano
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped and toasted
3/4 c  Fresh bread crumbs
2 ts Olive oil
Place peppers in a large microwave-safe pie plate, cover with plastic
wrap and microwave 4-6 minutes on 100 percent power, rotating after 2
minutes. Peppers should soften but not collapse. Cut off the tops and
remove the seeds. Leave the peppers in the pie plate with the lids on
the side (for garnish).

Preheat the broiler.

In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, garlic, feta, egg, oregano and
walnuts. Fill peppers with this mixture. Mix bread crumbs with olive
oil and sprinkle over cheese filling. Cover the stuffed peppers
loosely with the plastic wrap and microwave for 8-12 minutes,
rotating after 4 minutes. Filling should be hot in the center. Remove
the plastic wrap and broil the peppers for a minute or two to brown
the crumbs. Serve immediately, allowing one stuffed pepper per
person. 507 calories and 15 grams fat.
