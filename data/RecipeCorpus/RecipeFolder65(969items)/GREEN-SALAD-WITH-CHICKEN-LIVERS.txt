Title: GREEN SALAD WITH CHICKEN LIVERS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Chicken livers
1/3 c  Whipping cream
1 ts Dijon mustard
1 pn White pepper
3 c  Green leaf lettuce -- torn
3 c  Chicory greens
1    Eggs, hard-boiled --
Chopped
1/2 c  Walnuts -- chopped
Walnut Oil Dressing
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts White pepper
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Walnut oil
1. Drain chicken livers and pat dry. In a medium frying pan mix cream,
mustard, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat,
stirring until cream is reduced by about a third. Mix in livers,
stirring gently to coat with cream. Reduce heat to medium and cook,
turning carefully occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a glaze
that clings to livers. Remove from heat and let stand until livers
are barely warm.

2. In a large bowl combine greens. Mix lightly with dressing. Divide
greens among 4 salad plates. Sprinkle each serving with a fourth of
the egg and a fourth of the walnuts.

3. Cut chicken livers into 1/4 inch slices; arrange overlapping slices
beside each serving of salad. Serve at once.

Walnut Oil Dressing: In a medium bowl mix vinegar, lemon juice,
mustard, salt, and pepper. Using a whisk or fork, gradually beat in
oil until dressing is slightly thickened and well combined.
