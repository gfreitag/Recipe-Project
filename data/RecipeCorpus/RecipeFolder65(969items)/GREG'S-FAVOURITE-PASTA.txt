Title: GREG'S FAVOURITE PASTA
Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 4 -6 serving
1 1/2 c  Unbleached flour;
- (do not use all purpose,
- it's too soft)
1 c  Semolina flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Olive oil
3 lg Whole eggs
1 tb Warm water (if needed)
Mix dry ingredients on a board forming a well in the center Add olive
oil and eggs to well. Mix with a fork by gradually blending in the
dry to the egg. When it gets too stiff to use a fork, begin to knead
by hand to proper consistency (should be very stiff) If necessary,
add warm water in small increments.

Allow dough to rest while covered for at least 10 minutes. Using a
floured board, cut off pieces of dough about the size of an egg.
Flatten with the palm or your hand. Process through pasta machine by
starting on the thickest setting. Roll through machine again at each
progressively thinner setting to form long strips the width of your
machine and the proper thickness for the desired style of pasta.
(this helps to incorporate the ingredients) At this point I gently
rub a small amount of flour on the surface and allow to air dry for
about 30 minutes. (this makes cutting easier) Attach cutting head for
the desired pasta type. Cut, lay-out on floured board, sprinkle
lightly with flour and allow to dry further. Can be cooked now or
rolled in freezer paper and frozen for later.

Remember, fresh pasta cooks a lot faster than the cardboard box
variety. Don't over-cook. If cut with a medium width head, these make
great chicken and noodles or cut thin for spaghetti.

By using 1 egg per cup of flour yields great looking and tasting
slightly golden pasta.  For those more health conscious, I believe
that the number of eggs can be reduced and replaced with water. A
little Saffron will put back the great rich looking color.
