Yield: 2 Servings

1 lb Watermelon rind
2 c  Water
2 c  Sugar
1    Lemon, sliced
1    Cinnamon stick
1 ts Whole cloves
The texture of these preserves is firm and thick and the taste
redolent with spices. Underripe melons are a good choice for this
recipe because the rinds are particularly firm.

Skin the rind and scrape it clean of any red flesh. Cut the rind into
half-inch cubes. Soak overnight in a solution of 1 gallon water and
1/2 cup salt.

Drain rind and cook in fresh water for about 50 minutes, or until just
tender when pierced with a fork. Drain well and set aside.

To make the syrup, combine the remaining ingredients in a pan large
enough to hold all the rind. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes.
Add rind and cook until it turns transparent, about 30 minutes. Pack
into clean glass jars, cover with hot syrup and seal. Store in the
refrigerator for up to 3 months.

Uses: This makes a wonderful condiment to serve with East Indian
curries or any other hot and spicy dish.

Makes 2 to 3 pints.
