Broil the salmon steaks, after brushing them with some cooking oil or
melted butter.  Meanwhile, put scallions in a saucepan with wine and
cinnamon and bring to a boil; turn down heat and simmer gently. When
salmon steaks are browned on both sides, add the lemon juice and
ginger to the sauce.  Put salmon on a serving dish and pour the sauce
over it.
