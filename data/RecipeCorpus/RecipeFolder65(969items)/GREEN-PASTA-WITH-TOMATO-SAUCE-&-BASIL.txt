For the Pasta: ==============

Place the flour on a work space or in the bowl of a mixer. Add
egg, salt and pepper.  Mix well, then add olive oil and basil puree.
Continue mixing.

Roll the dough into a ball and work it by hand until it's smooth.
Sprinkle the dough ball with flour and run it through a pasta
machine. Dust the noodles with flour and do not dry before cooking.

For the Sauce: ==============

Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the mirepoix, shallot puree,
bay leaves, thyme, oregano, and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes (to
allow the flavors to come out).

Add white wine and cook briefly.  Add the basil, tomatoes, tomato
puree, garlic puree, chicken stock and veal stock. Cook for 15 minutes
(until the vegetables are soft).

Strain into another saucepan and adjust the seasonings. Reduce
the mixture over high heat for 10 minutes. Reserve.

To Assemble: ============

Cook the pasta in plain boiling water, then drain.

In a saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of
basil puree, salt and pepper.  Add the pasta to the saute pan.

Add a little tomato sauce to the pasta and heat.

To serve, ladle the sauce onto serving plates, swirl pasta in the
center and garnish with basil leaves and chopped chives.
