boiling water 5 min. Drain and stir into the spaghetti. 4. Cut the
zucchini in half lengthwise. Slice each half crosswise into 1/4"
pieces. Stir these into the spaghetti. 5. Cut the snow peas on the
diagonal into 3/4" slices. Stir these into the spaghetti. 6. Stir in
the mushrooms and tomatoes. 7. Combine the parsley and basil. Shower
the salad with the combined herbs but do not toss. 8. Salad can be
served now or covered and refrigerated. If chilled, let it return
nearly to room temperature for best flavor.
