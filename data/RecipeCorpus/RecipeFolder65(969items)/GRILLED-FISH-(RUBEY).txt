Title: GRILLED FISH (RUBEY)
Categories: Jane, Rubey
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Swordfish -- fresh
1    Spray oil
Swordfish comes with skin.  Try Ono, a Hawaiian fish (comes
skinless). With fish at room temperature, lightly spray or brush with
oil. (Do this away from grill to prevent any possibility of flameup.)
On hot grill, cook fish for 5 minutes. Carefully turn over and
continue cooking, allowing about 10 minutes altogether per inch
thickness of fish. Check for doneness in thickest part of fish,
carefully pulling apart and looking to see if flesh is opaque.
Remember, fish will continue to cook a bit even after it is removed
from heat. Remove any skin, if desired. Serve on top of Grilled
Smashed Red Potatoes; top with Papaya, Pepper Relish.

NOTES : If you use your own fresh fish in this recipe, aim for about
2 oz. of cooked, boned and skinned fish per person -- if you want to
keep the protein values in line. If you are purchasing fish, fattier
fishes such as swordfish and salmon lend themselves to grilling
better than lean fishes such as halibut and tuna. In either case,
take care not to overcook; fish will become dry, even tough, when
overdone, especially if lean. Recipe By : Jane Rubey, 1996,
