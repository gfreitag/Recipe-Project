Title: GRILLED BUTTERFLIED LEG OF LAMB
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lb Leg of lamb,
-butterflied (approx)
2 ts Salt
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
1 c  Olive oil
2    Lemons, juiced
1/3 c  Tomato paste
2 ts Rosemary
1/2 ts Black pepper,
-ground coarse
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Savory
Have the butcher butterfly the leg of lamb, or do it yourself.

Combine all remaining ingredients in a glass, enamel, stainless, or
plastic container and beat with a whisk or fork until combined. It
takes a few minutes.

Add the lamb, turning it to make sure it is coated on all sides.
Marinate two hours at room temperature, or overnight in the
refrigerator. Check occasionally to make sure that it is still coated
with the marinade and re-cover as necessary.

Grill outside, or broil inside at about 8 inches from the flame for 15
minutes on each side, brushing occasionally with the marinade. Serve
sliced thin (hot) with the rest of the marinade, heated.

NOTES:

*  Leg of Lamb with Rosemary & Tomato Baste -- My wife and I have
used this recipe a number of times, and have found that the marinade,
in and of itself, is excellent for any type of lamb. Yield: Serves
6-8.

*  This also makes wonderful sandwiches if there are any leftovers.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  several hours marinating, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
