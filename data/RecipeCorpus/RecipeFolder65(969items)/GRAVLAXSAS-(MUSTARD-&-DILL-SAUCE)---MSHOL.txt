Title: GRAVLAXSAS (MUSTARD & DILL SAUCE) - MSHOL
Categories: Swedish, Sauces
Yield: 3 /4 cup
4 tb Mustard; dark, highly
-seasonsed, prepared
1 ts Mustard powder
3 tb Sugar
2 tb White Vinegar
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
3 tb Dill; fresh, chopped
In a small deep bowl, mix the two mustards, sugar and vinegar to a
paste. With a wire whisk, slowly beat in the oil until it forms a
thick mayonnaise-like emulsion. Stir in the chopped dill. The sauce
may be kept refrigerated in a tightly covered jar for several days,
but will probably need to be shaken vigorously or beaten with a whisk
to remix the ingredients before serving it again.
