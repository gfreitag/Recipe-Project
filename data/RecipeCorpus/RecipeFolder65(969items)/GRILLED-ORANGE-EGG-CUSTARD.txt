Title: GRILLED ORANGE EGG CUSTARD
Categories: Desserts, Camping foo
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Orange or Grapefruit
1    Large egg
2 tb Milk
Sugar & cinnamon to taste
With  the navel at the bottom, slice off the top of the orange & dig
out all the pulp and fruit (to eat!!)... save the "orange cup"... in
fact, serve oranges during dinner & get evryone to save their orange
cups for this.

Crack egg into a bowl with the milk, sugar & cinnamon and gently
whisk it a little with a fork, but don't over mix, you want the lumps
of smooth egg white when it's cooked.

Place egg mixture in the orange cup & place them over a grilling
stand over EMBERS (not the fire).. wait till egg looks cooked, but
not hard. Eat! Yum!
