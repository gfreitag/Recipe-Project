Title: GRILLED FISH TACOS
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 1 Servings  Recipe by: Rich McCormack <macknet@CTS.COM> Marinate shark or fish
fillets (tuna, swordfish, halibut, mahi-mahi, or whatever) in lime
juice and salsa picante (as "picante" as you wish) for about 30
minutes. Grill the fillets on a charcoal, electric, or gas BBQ grill
(or a ribbed cast iron "grilling" pan on a stove top), sprinkling
both sides with Rich's pico de gallo spice mix (see above) during the
grilling. The grill can be brushed with olive, corn, or peanut oil to
keep the fish from sticking. When done, slice the fish into approx.
1/2 inch slices and serve as above.

To be honest, when I suggest fish tacos to visiting friends or
relatives from out of the So. Calif. area, I usually get some sort of
a response such as "you ain't gonna put no fish on MY taco." But
those who try 'em usually like 'em...

BTW -- Have you ever tried fish enchiladas? Mmmmm...mmm, muy bueno
