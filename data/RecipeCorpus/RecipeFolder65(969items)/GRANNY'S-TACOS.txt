Categories: Main dish, Cst
Yield: 2 Dozen
2 pk Corn tortilla (12 ct)
1 lb Hamburger
1 sm Onion, chopped
4 cl Garlic, minced
1 md Potato, peeled, boiled
-and mashed, or use leftover
Garlic salt
Black pepper, fresh ground
Oil for frying
MMMMM-------------------------CONDIMENTS------------------------------
Chopped tomato
Shredded lettuce (iceberg)
Grated cheddar
Chopped onion
Sliced olives
Sour cream
Avacado or guacamole
Salsa or taco sauce
Let tortillas come to room temperature before attempting to use them.
Use a well seasoned iron skillet for frying.

Filling: Crumble hamburger into a skillet and add onion and garlic.
Cook unitl meat is browned and onions are verging on translucent. Add
mashed potatoes and stir in. Add garlic salt and pepper to taste.
When all is hot and potatoes are well incorporated, turn burner to
low and keep warm.

To Fry: Heat skillet with oil about 1/16 to 1/8 inches deep. You will
need to add more as you cook.  You should be able to cook at least
two tacos at a time in an average size skillet. Just be sure to watch
as they will burn quickly.  When a drop of water sizzles, begin to
fry. Take a stack of tortillas and place a heaping spoonful of
filling in the middle. Fold (like a taco :>) and place fold in hot
oil to set. When it holds the shape lay on it's sde and fry one side.
Use tongs to place in oil and to turn. When it is just crispy, turn
to other side, and finish frying. Remove to plate covered with paper
towels to soak up excess oil. While you are waiting for each batch to
brown, spoon the filling for the next batch onto tortillas so you
have them ready.

Putting it all together: Add cheese first, then whatever more liquid
ingredients you prefer (salsa, guacamole, etc)then the small chuncky
ingredints and end with shredded lettuce (it sorta holds al the good
stuff in).  Eat and enjoy. They are pretty messy, but it's worth it
