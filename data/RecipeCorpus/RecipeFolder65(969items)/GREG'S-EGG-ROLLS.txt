Title: GREG'S EGG ROLLS
Categories: Oriental, Appetizers
Yield: 50 Won tons
1/2 lb Ground Beef and Pork mix
1/2 c  Onion - finely chopped
1/2 lb Cabbage - shredded
1 cn Bean Sprouts - well drained
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Soy Sauce
1 tb Peanut Butter(more to taste)
1 ts Sugar
Mix ingredients well.

Spoon into egg roll wrappers (for fullsize egg rolls) or won ton
skins (for smaller appetizers) following package directions. Deep fat
fry in enough peanut oil to cover in batches until golden brown.

I prefer more peanut butter (chunky) and to use the smaller won ton
skins as they are easier to wrap and faster to cook.

These do NOT have a pronounced peanut butter flavor but taste similar
to Cashews which are commonly used in oriental cooking.
