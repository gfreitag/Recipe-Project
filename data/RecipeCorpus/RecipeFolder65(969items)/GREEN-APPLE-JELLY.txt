Title: GREEN APPLE JELLY
Categories: Canning
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lb Green apples
3 c  Water
1/2 c  Lemon juice
Sugar
Clean sterilized jelly bag and cheesecloth Do Not peel or core
fruit, just wash and cut into pieces Seeds & Skin contain most pectin
so they should be cooked along with the pulp. This will assure a firm
jelly. Cover the fruit with the water, add more if needed, add lemon
juice and boil until tender, remove from heat and mash. Strain the
fruit through the jellybag.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUSH THE JUICE BY SQUEEZING THE BAG OR MASHING THE
FRUIT DOWN. AS THIS WILL CAUSE THE JELLY TO BE CLOUDY.

Let the fruit stand in jelly bag 4 to 6 hours or overnight if you
have the space available. The following morning add sugar 1 cup to 1
cup juice, boil until candy thermometer reads 220 degrees F turn off
the heat and skim the froth. fill and cap the jars. Note: Your pan
must be big enough so jelly can raise up in a rolling boil. This is a
boil that cannot be stirred down. Jelly must boil at a rolling boil
until it reaches the 220 degree stage or jelly will not set.
