Title: GREEN BEANS IN BASIL SAUCE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Fresh green beans
6 tb Olive oil
2 md Onions, sliced thinly
4    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
-seeded & chopped
Salt
Freshly ground white pepper
1    Bouquet Garni
1/2 c  Finely chopped basil
2    Garlic cloves
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
Snap off the tips of the green beans.  Bring a large casserole of
salted water to a boil.  Add the beans and cook for 10 minutes or
until barely tender.  Drain immediately and run under cold water.
This retains their freshness and color.  In a large skillet, heat 4 T
of olive oil. Add the onions and cook them for 10 minutes, covered,
over low heat until they are soft but not browned. Add the tomatoes,
salt, pepper and Bouquet Garni. Cook the mixture for 10 to 15 minutes
over fairly high heat until it is very thick.  Remove the bouquet.
Add the drained green beans to the skillet and simmer covered for 5
minutes. Puree the basil, garlic, parsley and the remaining olive oil
in the electric blender. Add the puree to the tomato and bean
mixture. Correct the seasoning. Heat through and serve.
