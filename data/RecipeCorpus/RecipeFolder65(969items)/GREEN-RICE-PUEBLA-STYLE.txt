Title: GREEN RICE PUEBLA STYLE
Categories: Grains, Mexican
Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
3    Poblano peppers
1 3/4 c  Reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 md Onion; minced
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 c  Long-grain white rice
1/2 c  Fresh or frozen corn kernels
3/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1 tb Parsley; minced
2 tb Cilantro; chopped
Preheat oven broiler.  Place peppers on a baking sheet and broil as
close to heat as possible, turning until charred all over, about 10
minutes. Or roast peppers directly over a gas flame, turning, until
charred, about 5 minutes.  Place peppers in a paper bag and let steam
10 minutes. Peel off blackened skin and rinse under cold running
water. Cut peppers open, discard stems and seeds. Chop peppers
coarsely and place in a blender or food processor.  Add 1/2 cup of
chicken broth and puree until smooth.

In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and
garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not brown, about 2
minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until coated with oil and
opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining chicken broth and pureed
chilies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15
minutes, or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.

Add corn kernels, salt, pepper, and parsley.  Stir gently to combine.
Cover and let stand off heat 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro and serve.
