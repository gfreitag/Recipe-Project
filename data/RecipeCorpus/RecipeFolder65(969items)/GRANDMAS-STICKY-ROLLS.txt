Make on dough cycle. There are several ways to make these one is to
cut into 12 to 15 equal pieces then roll each into a rope about 6 to
8 inches long tie in a knot and pinch ends together and place pinched
end side down in a lightly greased pan. Let rise till doubled about
45 minutes. The other way is to cut up 36 equal pieces and roll into
balls then place three balls into a muffin tin. Let rise as
previously stated. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 13 to 15
minutes till tops are a golden brown. For the sticky part after
removal of rolls from oven brush on a mixture of melted butter about
1 TBL and 1 Tbl sugar heated in a sauce pan till sugar is slightly
dissolved let mixture cool some and brush on rolls. These rolls are
just as good without. They also reheat real well. If you would like
to make brown and serve rolls bake rolls at 250 for 20 to 30 minutes.
DO NOT BROWN. Let them cool completely before storing (DO NOT put on
the glaze) tops of rolls will be slightly tacky will last 5 to 7 days
in fridge and a month in freezer to bake brown and serve preheat oven

roll out dough into a rectangle about 1/4 to 1/8 inch thick depend on
how many and how big you want to make them. Take 1 TBL of soft butter
and spread all around leaving 1/4 inch of edge. Then sprinkle
cinnamon all around as much as you want then take 1/2 cup brown sugar
and sprinkle. You can also add the same amount raisins. Roll up into
a log and cut off about 1-1/2 to 2 inches and place in a lightly
greased pan. Let rise 45 minutes and bake 15 to twenty minutes at
350. when somewhat cooled drizzle on a glaze of powdered sugar,
butter, vanilla extract and milk then devour. Happy holidays
