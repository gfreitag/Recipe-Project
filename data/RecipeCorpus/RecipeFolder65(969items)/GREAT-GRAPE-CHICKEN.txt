Title: GREAT GRAPE CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Chicken breasts, halved,
-boned, skinned (6 halves,
-about 3 lb in all)
2 tb Butter (or margarine)
1 tb Orange marmalade (I suggest
-fresh coarsely-grated
-orange peel)
1/4 ts Tarragon, crumbled
1/3 c  White wine, dry
1    Green onion,
-thinly sliced (use
-part of the top)
1 c  Grapes, seedless
-(try red grapes,
-such as "Flame")
1/4 c  Cream, whipping
Salt
Nutmeg
Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and nutmeg.  Brown lightly in
heated butter in a large frying pan. Add marmalade, tarragon, green
onion and wine. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.

Add grapes, cover again and continue cooking about 10 minutes longer,
until chicken is cooked through (test with a small, sharp knife in
thickest part).

Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken and grapes to a warm serving
dish; keep warm. Add cream to liquid in pan. Bring to boiling,
stirring, and cook until reduced and slightly thickened. Salt to
taste. Pour sauce over chicken.

NOTES:

*  Chicken in wine with grapes and orange -- This recipe was
originally posted by Wayne Thompson. I thought it was great, and I
submit it here with some variations. This colors in this dish are a
feast for the eyes. The recipe comes originally from "Elegant Meals
with Inexpensive Meats," by Ortho Books. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.

*  (WT) I use a whole cut up chicken.

*  (CSR) I like to cook the chicken in a black cast-iron pan; I skip
the cream sauce, because it smothers the beautiful
black-green-red-orange-tan colors.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
