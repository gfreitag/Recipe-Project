Combine the brown sugar, mustard and soy sauce and mix well.  Spread
the mixture evenly over the chops and marinate, covered, in the
refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours.

Melt 1 ounce of butter in a non-reactive pan and saute the carrot,
celery, onion, ginger, thyme, shallots, garlic, bay leaf, and
peppercorns until the onion turns golden brown.  Add the port wine,
heat and reduce until thick.

Add the cherries and the Habanero and cook until all the juices are
extracted from the cherries.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, then
reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.

Remove from the heat and strain through a very fine seive, pressing
with a kitchen spoon to extract all the juices.

Return the strained liquid to a pan over low heat and whip in the
remaining butter, 1 ounce at a time.  Dissolve the cornstarch in the
water and add it to the sauce.  Heat and stir until the sauce
thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Season the sauce with
salt and pepper to taste. Keep the sauce warm.

Grill the pork chops to desired doneness and serve with the sauce
ladled over them.
