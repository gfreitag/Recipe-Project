2/3 c  Plain yogurt
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1    Piece fresh ginger, about

1. Combine all ingredients except hens. Transfer to a large plastic
food bag. Rinse hens well; pat dry. Add hens to bag with yogurt
mixture and seal tightly. Refrigerate, turning several times, 12

coals are covered with gray ash, carefully move them to the sides of
the grill; position a drip pan in the center. Put cooking rack in
place. Place the hens on their side on the rack over the drip pan.
Grill, covered, turning once, until the juice from the thigh runs
clear, 25 minutes.
