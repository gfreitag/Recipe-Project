Categories: Salads, Cheese/eggs, Ew
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
2 tb Strong brewed Earl Grey tea
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Finely chopped parsley,
Preferably Italian flat-leaf
1    Clove garlic, finely chopped
1/2 ts Dijon mustard
1/4 ts Dried marjoram
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 lb Portobello mushrooms (about
4 ea large)
6 c  Washed, dried and torn salad
Greens (curly red & green
Leaf lettuce)
2 oz Aged or fresh goat cheese
1    Vine-ripened tomato, peeled
Seeded & diced
Place a broiler pan about 6" from the source of heat; preheat the
broiler and broiler pan.  In a large bowl, whisk together 1 T oil,
the tea, vinegar, parsley, garlic, mustard, marjoram, salt and
pepper; set aside. Trim mushroom stems and reserve for another use.
Wipe mushroom caps clean with a damp paper towel.  Brush the mushroom
caps with the remaining 1 T oil and season lightly with salt and
pepper. Place the mushrooms, rounded side facing up, on the preheated
broiler pan and broil until tender and lightly browned, 2 to 4
minutes per side. While the mushrooms broil, add salad greens to the
dressing and toss. Arrange the greens on 4 individual salad plates.
When the mushrooms are done, cut them into thick slices and set them
on the greens.  Crumble cheese over the mushrooms and scatter
tomatoes over all.  Add a grinding of black pepper and serve.
