Title: GRAPEFRUIT & ORANGE SECTIONS
Categories: Fruits, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 15 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 13 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
pints--an average of about 2 pounds yields 1 quart.

Quality: Select firm, mature, sweet fruit of ideal quality for eating
fresh. The flavor of orange sections is best if the sections are
canned with equal parts of grapefruit. Grapefruit may be canned
without oranges. Sections may be packed in your choice of water,
citrus juice or syrup.

Procedure: Wash and peel fruit and remove white tissue to prevent a
bitter taste. If you use syrup, prepare a very light, light, or
medium syrup and bring to boil. Fill jars with sections and water,
juice or hot syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and
process.

Processing directions for canning grapefruit and orange sections in a
boiling-water, a dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table
