1    Leek; chopped

1/3 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Chopped parsley

Serves 6-10 Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 50 minutes
Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems. Chop coarsely and put
into a large pan. Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking
pan now and then or turning spinach with a fork.  Heat just long
enough to wilt spinach so that juices can run out freely. Drain well
in a colander, pressing occasionally with a spoon. Gently fry the
onion in olive oil for 10 minutes, add chopped leek and spring onions
and fry gently for further 5 minutes until transparent. Place
well-drained spinach in a mixing bowl and add oil and onion mixture,
herbs and nutmeg. Blend thoroughly, adding salt and pepper to taste.
Place a sheet of fillo pastry on work surface and brush lightly with
olive oil. Top with 3 more sheets of pastry, brushing each with oil.
Brush top layer lightly with oil and place half the spinach mixture
along the length of the pastry towards one edge and leaving 4 cm
(1-1/2-inches) clear on one side. Fold bottom edge of pastry over
filling, roll once, fold in sides then roll up. Place a hand at each
end of roll and push it in gently like a concertina. Repeat with
remaining pastry and filling. Place rolls in an oiled baking dish
leaving space between rolls. Brush tops lightly with oil and bake in
a moderate oven for 30 minutes until golden. Serve hot cut in
portions.
