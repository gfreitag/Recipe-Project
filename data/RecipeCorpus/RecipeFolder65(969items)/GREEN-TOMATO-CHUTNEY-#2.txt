vinegar; bring to a boil; boil 30 minutes.

Tie pickling spice in large square of cheesecloth, creating spice
bag; add to mixture in pan. Stir in sugar and chili powder; simmer
over medium heat about 2 hours or until thickened. Stir frequently to
prevent scorching.

between glass and food, readjust headspace to 1/2 inch. Wipe jar rim,
removing any stickiness. Center lid on jar; apply screw band just
until fingertip tight. Place in canner. Repeat for remaining jars.
Cover canner, return water to a boil, process 10 minutes. Remove
jars. Cool 24 hours. Check jar seals (sealed lids curve downward).
Remove screw bands, store separately. Wipe jars, label and store in a
cool, dark place. Serve this sweet chutney with hot spicy entrees and
appetizers. Makes 7-500 mL jars.
