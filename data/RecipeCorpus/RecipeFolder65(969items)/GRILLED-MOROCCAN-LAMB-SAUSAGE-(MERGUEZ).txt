Title: GRILLED MOROCCAN LAMB SAUSAGE (MERGUEZ)
Categories: Sausage, Lamb, Moroccan
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/3 lb Lean lamb, ground with
2/3 lb Lamb, pork or beef fat
2 tb Water
1 1/2 tb Minced garlic
2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Paprika
1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
1 1/4 ts Cinnamon
3/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1 1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
2    Feet hog casing
2 tb Olive oil; optional
1 lg Green pepper; optional
2 md Onions; optional
Combine all ingredients except the olive oil and the three optional
items in a large bowl and mix well. If making sausages, use the
sausage attachment on a heavy-duty mixer, stuff the casings with the
mixture and twist and tie to make eight 4-inch links. Or shape into
eight 3-inch-long lozenges, slightly fatter in the middle, formed
around metal skewers or into 8 patties.

Preheat grill or broiler.

If the sausages are in casings, prick with a fork 2 to 3 times and
brush with oil. Grill or broil 3 to 4 minutes on each side until
cooked through. For lozenges, brush with oil and cook 3 to 4 minutes
on each side. For patties, brush with oil and grill 4 to 5 minutes on
each side or saute over high heat.

If desired, sausages may be threaded on skewers alternately with green
pepper pieces and onion quarters before grilling. Makes 4 servings.
