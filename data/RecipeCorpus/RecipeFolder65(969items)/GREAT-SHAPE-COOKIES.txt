Title: GREAT-SHAPE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 30 Servings
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Granulated sugar
2 x  Large eggs
1 tb Milk
MMMMM-----------------KNEAD IN 1/4 C FLOUR LATER----------------------
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour,save 1/4 c
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Almond
CHILL DOUGH SEVERAL HOURS OR OVERNIGHT: Could put the dough in the
freezer to chill, if in a hurry, for 1-2 hours. Heat oven to 300
degrees. Grease cookie sheet (only ONCE). No need to grease it each
time.
Add ingredients together, saving out the 1/4 cup of flour. Knead
the 1/4 cup flour into the dough now, chill. Roll out, using flour on
surface, cutters and rolling pin, generously. Try to get more flour
on tiny places.
This is a great recipe for the creased cookie cutters, because it
is delicious and dough does not lose its shape. For this type of
cutter, roll to about 1/4" thickness, so dough is just thick enough
to leave the cutter imprints. Ordinarily, roll dough to 1/4"
thickness for best results. Any cookie will lose detail and shape
when it is too thick. This cookie is good iced with thin royal icing.
Cookie stays soft, but is not terribly fragile. Source: Shared with
me by Mary Billersen of Cin. because I helped her replace some
favorite cookie cutters she'd lost. These cookies have been a
tradition in her family for generations. Dolores McCann, Hamilton OH
