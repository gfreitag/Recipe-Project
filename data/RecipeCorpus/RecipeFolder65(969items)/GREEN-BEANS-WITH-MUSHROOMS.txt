serving: 1 VEGETABLE EXCHANGE + 1 FAT EXCHANGE (Nancy O'S note: 1/2
Cup of butter I sure would use margarine and would, for sure, cut
back on it even though I switched to margarine MAKE IT WORK. I find
it is really important to fix them veggies that are taste for the
diet.....)

NANCY C'S NOTE: Yes, the recipe DOES call for 1/2 cup butter. This
seems excessive to me so I'll probably just use a tablespoon or two.
(Sorry Nancy C. not me!!! It will be 1 to 2 tablespoon margarine for
me)
