Title: GRANDMA'S CINNAMON ROLLS
Categories: Desserts, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1/2 tb Yeast
3 c  Flour, bread
1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
2 tb Oil
1    Eggs; room temp
1/2 c  Milk; warm
1/2 c  Water; warm
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Butter; melted
3 tb Sugar
3 tb Sugar, brown
1/4 c  Nuts, chopped
1 tb Cinnamon, ground
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1 c  Sugar, powdered
1 1/2 tb Butter; melted
1/4 ts Extract, maple
2 tb Coffee; hot
Place ingredients into pan in the order listed.

Select manual or dough setting.

After the machine has completed the second rising, it will beep. In
the Hitachi I cheat and take it out about 10 min before the beep as
it has reached the top of the pan.

On a lightly floured surface, roll or pat to 12"x9" rectangle. Brush
with melted butter.  Combine sugars, nuts, and cinnamon; sprinkle
over dough. Starting with shorter side, roll up tightly. Pinch edge
to seal. Cut into 12 slices.  Place on greased 13"x9" pan. Or cut 9
slices, throw away the two end pieces and place in 9" round pan, with
one in the middle and the rest arranged around the outside. (looks
real nice) Cover; let rise in a warm place until almost double in
volume, (about 30 minutes).

Preheat oven to 375.  Bake 20-25 minutes.

To prepare glaze, combine sugar, melted butter, maple extract, and hot
coffee.  Blend until smooth.  Drizzle over hot rolls.
