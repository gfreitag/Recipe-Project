Title: GREEN APPLE SORBET
Categories: Ice cream, Fruits
Yield: 1 Quart
1 1/4 lb Green apples, crisp; about
-5 cups, sliced
2 1/2 tb Lemon juice, fresh
1 1/4 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1 ds Cinnamon
Wash the apples well, quarter and core them, then slice the quarters
thinly crosswise. Toss the apple slices in a bowl with the lemon
juice, until all are evenly coated. Cover the bowl tightly with a lid
or with plastic wrap and freeze the apple slices for several hours,
or overnight.

Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and stir gently over medium
heat until all the sugar is dissolved. Bring the syrup to a boil and
let it boil for a few minutes. Transfer the syrup to a bowl and let
it cool completely.

Put the frozen apple slices and cooled syrup into the food processor
and puree as smoothly as possible. This puree will always have a
little texture from the flecks of green apple peel. Add a little dash
of cinnamon, not too much, and give it another spin. Put the puree
into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's
instructions.
