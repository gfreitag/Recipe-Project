Title: GREEK GREEN BEANS (SKETA FASSOULA)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Green beans (thin,tender
-ones are best)
1 md Yellow onion, chopped finely
Olive Oil
4 md Tomatoes
Salt and Pepper
Wash and string the beans, but leave them whole.  In a large, deep
skillet, heat about 3-4 T. of olive oil until hot. Add the onion and
saute for about 5 minutes until it is tender, but not brown. Add the
green beans. Cover the skillet (if you don't have a lid use a cookie
sheet--I do!). Cook for about 15 minutes or until the beans start to
wilt. Coarsely chop two of the tomatoes (ONLY TWO).  Add to the pan
and cover again. Cook for another 15-20 minutes until the tomatoes
have melted into a sauce. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed. If
necessary add another one or two chopped tomatoes and continue
cooking. You may need to add extra olive oil also as it contributes
to the flavor. Cook until the beans are very tender. Trust me,
crunchy does NOT work with this dish. Serve hot, cold, or at room
temperature (the way Greeks do--at least my Greek family does!). If
you can find good, creamy feta, crumble a good chunk into the beans
before serving. Elizabeth (Lisa) Wooll ewooll@ctp.org
