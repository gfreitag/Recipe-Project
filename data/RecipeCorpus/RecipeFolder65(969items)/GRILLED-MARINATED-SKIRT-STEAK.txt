Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Cumin seeds
4    Jalapeno peppers, halved and
-seeded
3    Cloves garlic
4 ts Cracked black pepper
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Lime juice (from about 4
-limes)
2 c  Coarsely chopped cilantro
-leaves and stems
1 c  Olive oil
3 lb Skirt steak, trimmed of

Avocado Corn Relish
12    Flour tortillas, heated
1. In a small, heavy frying pan, toast the cumin seeds over
moderately high heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Transfer the cumin seeds to a blender.

2. Add the jalapenos, garlic, black pepper and salt to the blender and
puree with the lime juice until the cumin seeds are finely ground.
Then add the cilantro and oil and puree until smooth.

3. Rub the meat all over with some of the marinade and roll each
piece into a cylinder. Arrange the meat in a shallow glass dish or
stainless-steel pan. Pour the remaining marinade over the meat. Cover
and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. About 30 minutes
before cooking, remove the meat from the refrigerator and unroll each
steak.

4. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Grill or broil the steaks for
3 minutes. Turn the meat and cook to your taste, about 3 to 4 minutes
longer for medium-rare. Transfer to a carving board and let rest in a
warm spot for 5 minutes. Slice the steaks across the grain and on the
diagonal. The slices should be about 1/4 inch thick. Serve with the
Avocado Corn Relish and warm flour tortillas.

Look for a robust red wine that won't be overwhelmed by the strong
Southwestern flavors of this marinated steak with its spicy relish.
