MMMMM----------------------------FISH---------------------------------
32 lg Shrimp
8 tb Juice, lime
1 1/2 c  Juice, pineapple
1/2 c  Rum, dark
1 ts Garlic cloves, crushed
Seed bell peppers.

Peel mangoes and slice fruit away from central pit. Dice the mango
fruit, red pepper, green pepper and onion. Combine all the remaining
ingredients in a bowl. Mix lightly then add diced mango, pepper and
onion. Mixture will keep in the refrigerator for three days.

Peel the shrimp and make a 1/4-inch deep incision on the top of each
one (the side without the feet) from tail to the head. Under cold,
running water, open the incision and wash away any brownish-black
waste matter.

In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the lime juice, pineapple
juice, rum, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Add he shrimp.
Cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours - no longer, or the shrimp will
start to cook in the lime juice.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade and discard the liquid. Run a
skewer through each shrimp so that each is pierced in two places. Put
the skewer through the tail area, then bend the shrimp over and put
the skewer through the thick section in the upper body area.

You should be able to fit 4 shrimp on a 6-inch skewer or 8 shrimp on
a 10 inch skewer.

If you are using wooden skewers, be careful not to leave any gaps
between the shrimp, or the skewer will burn through. Place the
skewered shrimp on a grill over medium-high heat.

Grill for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until the shells turn
bright red.

The meat should be an even opaque white. Remove the shrimp from the
grill ad serve on a bed of Mango-Lime relish.

The recipes are from _Thrill of the Grill_
