2 c  Garlic

Cook potatoes on stove top in water to cover or in microwave oven
on HIGH (l00T power) until almost tender. Drain potatoes. Toss with
garlic, rose- mary and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Can be prepared day ahead to this point and refrigerated. To
grill, divide potatoes in half.
Place each batch in single layer be- tween   large pieces heavy duty
foil (or double  thickness regular foil). Bring up ends of foil to
close airtight.
Puncture several holes  in  each packages.  Place on grill rack over
hot coals, turning several times, until cooked, about 7 minutes
total. Unwrap and serve immediately. Makes 6 serv- ings. Puncturing
the foil with holes allows some ot the smokiness to perme- ate the
potatoes. P FRISCHKNECHT
