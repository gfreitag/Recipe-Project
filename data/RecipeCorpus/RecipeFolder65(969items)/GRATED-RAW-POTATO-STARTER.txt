Title: GRATED RAW POTATO STARTER
Categories: Breads, Potatoes
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Warm water
1 ts Sugar
1 1/2 c  White flour
1 md Grated potato
1 ts Salt
Mix the 1 cup warm water, 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1 tsp. each salt
and sugar in a 2-cup measure.  Add enough grated potato to make 2
cups. Place in a wide mouth glass jar or small mixing bowl (do not
use metal or plastic) which will hold about 1 quart. Cover with a
single thickness of cheesecloth to allow wild yeast from the air to
settle into it for 24 hours.  Stir well, cover tightly with a
clinging transparent wrap which will cause the moisture to drip back
and keep top of mixture from drying. Stir several times a day. In two
or three days it will become foamy and very light. (The length of
time depends on temperature. 80 ~85 is ideal. It can go a little
below 80 without harm, only slowing the procedure a little, but if it
goes much higher than 85 it will be spoiled.) Then stir well, pour
into glass jar with screw-top lid and store in refrigerator at about
38 degrees.  As soon as 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the top
it has ripened enough to start using. Do not be concerened if the
mixture turns dark because of the raw potato during the fermentation
period. It does not affect the bread made from it in any way and as
soon as the starter is mature, it will become a snowy white. To renew
starter: Add 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1-1/2 cups water each time it
is used so that there are always 2 cups to bake with and 2 full cups
to return to refrigerator.  If for some reason it cannot be used
regularly about twice a week, add 1 tsp. sugar and stirr well every
three or four days.
