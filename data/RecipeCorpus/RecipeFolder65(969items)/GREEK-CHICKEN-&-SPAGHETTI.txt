Spaghetti according to package directions; drain. In Dutch oven or
large skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add chicken
mixture and red pepper. Stir-fry just until chicken is slightly pink.
Add yellow squash and zucchini. Cook until hot. In small bowl, blend
water, cornstarch, bouillon and salt. Add to chicken mixture. Cook,

doubled as well as the marinade ingredients or else the pasta amount
cut in half. It is also excellent cold served as a pasta salad. This
might be good with rotelle pasta as well.
