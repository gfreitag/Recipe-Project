Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Rock Cornish Hens (about 3/4
-to 1 lb. ea.)split in half
3 c  Fresh or frozen raspberries
1 c  Raspberry vinegar
3/4 c  Olive oil

One day before serving, rinse the birds and pat dry. Place the
birds on a shallow baking dish. Combine the raspberries and vinegar
in a saucepan. Heat to boiling and boil for 1 minute. Remove from
heat. Stir in the oil, bay leaves and thyme.  Cool to room
temperature. Pour the marinade over the birds and sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Marinate overnight in the refrigerator, turning
occasionally.
Prepare hot coals for grilling.  Remove the birds from the
marinade and grill a few inches above the hot coals, basting
occasionally with the marinade, until juices run clear when the
thickest part of a thigh is pierced.  Serve immediately.
