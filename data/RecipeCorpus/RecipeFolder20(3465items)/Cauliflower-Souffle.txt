Souffle de Chou-Fleur The fertile plains around Lac St. Jean produces
excellent vegetables and supports thriving dairy farms. A strong
cheddar cheese, made at St. Prime on the west side of the lake and
aged up to 4 years, is one of the region's finest cheeses. Adele
Coperman-Langevin of St. Fulhence combines cauliflower from her
market garden in her souffle.

Cook cauliflower in boiling, salted water until tender, drain well
and mash. Melt butter in medium saucepan, blend in flour and cook,
stirring over medium heat until bubbly; do not let mixture brown.
Meanwhile, bring milk to a boil in another saucepan. Add hot milk to
butter-flour mixture and cook, stirring over medium heat until sauce
thickens  and is smooth. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Remove from heat.
Lightly beat egg yolks and stir into sauce. Then stir in cheese and
cauliflower until smooth. In a large bowl, beat egg whites until
stiff but not dry. Fold cauliflower mixture gently but thoroughly
into beaten egg whites. Pour into a buttered 2 quart (2 L) souffle
dish. Bake in preheated 350F oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or till
puffed, firm and lightly browned. Serve at once. SERVES: 4-6
