Title: Salmon Croquettes
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Onion
1 c  Matzoh meal
1 cn Salmon (15 oz)
1 lg Potato
1    Egg
Cube a large potato and an onion. Then put in a food processor and
chop until grated. Add egg and mix. Remove to a bowl and add the can
of salmon. I washed the salmon off to remove the salt as much as I
could. This optional. Then I mixed the salmon and potato mixture and
slowly added matzoh meal until mixture was solid enough to make
patties. After I made patties then I dipped each patty into a dish of
matzoh meal. Coating all around. Let the patties stand for a while.
It is a good idea to chill them for about 1/2 to 1 hour to set. Then
fry patties in hot oil until brown and turn to the other side and
brown. About 10 minutes on each side. This made me 8 patties. I
drained the patties on paper towels.
