"These tarts were the basis for Butter Tart Pie and Butter Tart
Squares which appeared in later decades. Another variation uses maple
syrup instead of corn syrup. ...Butter Tarts are uniquely Canadian.
There are theories whether they were adapted from southern pecan pie,
old-fashioned sugar pies, or maple syrup, backwoods or vinegar pies.
Squabbles arise whether or not the tarts should be runny or not, and
just how runny. Opinions differ about the use of syrup or sugar only,
eggs beaten or not, currants or raisins, and how the tart pans should
be filled."

In bowl, cream together butter, sugar and vanilla. Beat in egg and
corn syrup. Spoon raisins into tart shells; pour in the filling,
two-thirds full. Bake in 375F oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until
lightly browned. MAKES: 12 TARTS
