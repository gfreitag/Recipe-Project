The aroma of charcoal broiling squid to perfection attracts customers
to the street stalls of many of the cities and small towns in the
southern region of Thailand.  The flavor would be enhanced by any
number of dipping sauces.
~---------------------------------------------------------------------
~-- Cut open the squid and remove the entrails, leaving the tentacles
intact. Remove the skin.

Place on a rack and charcoal-broil for 2 minutes on each side.  Brush
with the combined fish sauce and soy sauce during broiling to add
color and more flavor.

Mix together the sauce ingredients and pour into a bowl.  Cut the
cooked squid into 1 inch pieces and serve with the dipping sauce.
