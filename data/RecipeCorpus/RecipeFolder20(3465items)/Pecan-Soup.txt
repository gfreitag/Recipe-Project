This is a wonderful fall soup, and only 200 calories per serving.
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. ON a baking sheet, toast the pecans for
10-to-15 minutes, checking from time to time to prevent burning. Toss
occasionally. In a food processor, place the pecans, garlic and about
1/2 cup of the stock. Turn the processor on and, with the motor
running, add stock until you have a creamy consistency. (The mixture
will absorb the stock.) Pass the pecan-stock mixture through a sieve
into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cream, season to taste
with salt and pepper and serve. PETER KUMP - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS
