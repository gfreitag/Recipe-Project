1 ea Chicken (3 lb)
1 x  Juice of 1-1/2 lemons

paprika, and add to the melted butter.  Pour over chicken.  If
possible, let the chicken sit overnight, uncovered, in the
refrigerator. Prepare the grill. Place the chicken, breast side up,

under the broiler to crisp the skin and brown, watching carefully so
that it doesn't burn.
