Title: Jello Rainbow Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 10 servings
2 c  Boiling water
1 pk Cool whip, thawed (8 oz)
1 pk White cake mix
2 pk Jello (3 oz) any flavor
Bake cake mix as directed on package.  Remove from pans to cool.
Rewash pans and put cakes back in them when the cakes are completely
cooled. It is best to use 2 8-9" round cake pans but you can use an
oblong pan if you want.  After cakes have been place back into pans
(top side up), prick them with utility fork at 1/2" intervals.
Meanwhile, dissolve each flavor separately in 1 cup boiling water.
Carefully pour one flavor gelatin over each cake layer (if using
oblong pan you must use the same flavors for the 2 pks).
Chill 3-4 hours.  Dip one cake pan in warm water for 10 sseconds,
then unmold cake layer onto serving plate. Top with about 1 c. cool
whip. Unmold second cake layer and carefully place on first layer.
Frost with remaining topping.  Chill.  Great moist'n fruity cake
especially for those who like a light, refreshing cake that is not
too sweet.
