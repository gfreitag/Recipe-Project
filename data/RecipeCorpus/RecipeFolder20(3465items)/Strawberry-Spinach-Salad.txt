Les Frises Vinaigrette et Leurs Pousses Vertes

Strawberries need not be confined to dessert, says Denis Pelletier,
chef at Restaurant Le Mouilin de St. Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. The
island is one of the province's lushest strawberry-growing areas. The
chef suggests serving this colourful salad with a semi-soft cheese as
St. Nectaire.

Make a salad dressing by combining vinegar, oil and water. Add chopped
shallots and pepper to taste. Arrange sliced strawberries in a spiral
formation on the spinach and drizzle with the dressing.
