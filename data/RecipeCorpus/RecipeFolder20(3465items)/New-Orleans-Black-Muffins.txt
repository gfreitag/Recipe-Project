3/4 c  Sugar
3 T  Baking powder

1 t  Salt
1 1/2 c  Chopped dry roasted pecans
3/4 c  Hot water

In a medium-size bowl combine the hot water and molasses, stirring

sift together the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
With a rubber spatula, fold the liquid mixture and the pecans into
