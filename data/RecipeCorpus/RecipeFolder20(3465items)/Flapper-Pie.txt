"In eastern Canada, this recipe was called Graham Wafer Cream Pie, but
westerners knew it as Flapper Pie. ... Cream pies like butterscotch,
banana, cream and coconut cream were favorites of this decade and
restaurants (called cafes in the West and usually run by Chinese
cook/owners) always had cream pies on their menus.

Combine crumbs, sugar and cinnamon; blend in butter. Set 1/4 c aside.
Press remainder onto bottom and sides of 9 inch pie plate. Bake in
375F oven for 8 minutes; cool.
Filling: In saucepan, mix sugar with cornstarch; blend in milk.
Cook over medium heat, stirring, until boiling; stir a little into
yolks, then retUrn to the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring, for
2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from heat; add vanilla and cool
slightly. Pour into pie crust.
Meringue: Beat egg whites with cream of tartar till soft peaks form;
gradually beat in sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread over filling,
sealing to crust. Top with reserved crumbs. Bake in 400F oven for 5
minutes or till lightly browned. Cool to room temperature, about 4
hours.
