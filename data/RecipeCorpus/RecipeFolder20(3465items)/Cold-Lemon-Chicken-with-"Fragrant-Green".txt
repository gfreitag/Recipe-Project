Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Appetizer, Chicken
Yield: 8 servings
Lettuce leaves
4 tb Cilantro leaves and stem,
Finely chopped
1    Lemon's juice
1 md Onion
1 lb (whole) chicken beast
6    Celery leaves
4 tb Chinese lemon sauce
1 1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
In a saucepan, put the onion, chicken breast, and celery leaves with
just enough water to cover.  Bring to a slow boil; cover and simmer
over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow the
chicken to cool in the liquid.  When it is cool, skin and boned the
chicken and slice it. Marinate the chicken slices and a mixture of
lemon sauce and soy sauce for 45 minutes. On a serving dish, arrange
the chicken slices on a bed of lettuce leaves; sprinkle with the
chopped cilantro. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the chicken slices.
Your guests can put some of the sliced chicken in the middle of a
lettuce leaf and roll it up like an egg roll before eating.  Makes 8
to 10 appetizer servings.

NOTE:  Cilantro, also called Chinese parsley, fresh coriander, and
"fragrant
green," gives the Szechuan dish its distinctive flavor. -- Verdi
