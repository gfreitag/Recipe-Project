2 tb Butter Or Oregano
1    Fresh Poltroon, Diced
1 c  Broached Onions

To prepare: With floured hands, on a floured surface, standing on a
floured floor, and just generally surrounded by mounds and mounds of
flour, combine the ingredients in a greased 5-5/8" by 16-3/8" pan,
then pour the mixture carefully into an ungreased 4-3/8" by 18-7/8"
