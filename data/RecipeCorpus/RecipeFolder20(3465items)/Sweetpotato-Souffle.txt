Scald milk and add sugar,salt,butter,nutmeg and potatoes; beat until
fluffy. Beat egg yolks and add to potatoes. Add raisins and pecans.
Beat egg whites stiff,fold into potatoes and pour into greased baking
dish. Bake in moder- ate oven (350 degrees.) 50 to 60 minutes or
until firm. Top with marshmallows and brown in oven. Serves 8. Note:
You might like to do a flower of peach slices in the center of your
sweetpotato souffle.
