cottage cheese, spreading to within 1/2-inch of the edge, sprinkle on
2 tsp of the Parmesan cheese, and top each patty with one of the
remaining patties sealing the edges firmly. Brown the patties in a
large skillet over medium-high heat, turning once. Drain off the fat

about 15 minutes.  Place a cheese slice on each patty, cover, and
heat until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Serve with the
remaining sauce in the skillet poured over them.
