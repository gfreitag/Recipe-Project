Quite awhile ago, someone was looking for Gluten-Free recipes. Since
I have developed severe allergies to grains, it was suggested to me
by someone here on the echo that it could be the gluten content that
was giving me trouble.  So I decided to try the gluten-free grains.
The gluten-free grains do not interchange readily in baking recipes.
A few days ago, I happened upon THE GLUTEN-FREE GOURMET Living Well
Without Wheat by Bette Hagman at the Half Price Book Store.  This
book is a real gem and I hope whoever was looking for gluten-free
recipes sees this msg. We have tried a couple of the recipes and they
really are pretty tasty--- I hadn't eaten a bakery item in over 3
months!  Here is the muffin recipe that I made on Easter morning and
everyone thought they were good.

In the mixing bowl, cream together sugar and shortening.  Then beat
in the eggs.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder and
add to the egg mixture alternately with the milk.  Don't overbeat.
Stir in the vanilla. These are best mixed by hand.  Pour into greased
muffin cups. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.
Makes 8 muffins.

NOTE:  I poured half the batter in the muffin tins and sprinkled a
mixture of cinnamon and sugar over the batter.  I covered with the
remaining batter and sprinkled the tops with more cinnamon and sugar.
