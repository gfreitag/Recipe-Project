++++++++++++++++++ Heat oil in a Dutch oven and saute onions 3
minutes. Add cabbage and immediately pour vinegar over cabbage to
prevent it from losing its red color.  Sprinkle with salt and sugar.
Add chopped apple or applesauce and a piece of salt pork.  Pour in
red wine and hot beef broth. Cover and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes.
Cabbage should be just tender, not soft. Shortly before end of
cooking time, remove salt pork; cube and retrun it to the cabbage if
desired.
Correct seasonings and serve.
