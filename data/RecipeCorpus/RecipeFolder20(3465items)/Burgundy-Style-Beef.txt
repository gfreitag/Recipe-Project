Title: Burgundy Style Beef
Categories: Beef, Marinade, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 ea Strips lemon peel
1 1/4 c  Burgundy
4 T  Oil
3 ea Slices bacon
2 T  Flour
2/3 c  Beef stock
6 oz Mushrooms
2 lb Round steak
1 x  Salt and pepper to taste
3 ea Onions
2 ea Garlic cloves
1/8 t  Thyme
1 ea Bay leaf
1 t  Parsley
Cut  the meat into neat,  fairly large cubes and put into a dish. Add
salt and  pepper to taste.   Peel and slice the onions and garlic
very thinly, sprinkle 1/3 of the onions and the garlic over the meat,
and add the thyme, bay leaf,  and parsley.   Add the lemon peel and
wine with about 1/4 of the oil.
Leave the meat to marinate for at least 2 hours, turning
occasionally. Cut  any rind from the bacon and dice it. Heat the
remaining oil in a heavy pan and gently fry the rest of the onions
and the bacon until just golden. Lift  the meat from the marinade
with a perforated spoon or strain the liquid from the meat,
retaining the liquid. Toss the meat in the flour then fry for several
minutes with the bacon and onions. Strain the wine marinade into the
pan,  stir well to blend, add the beef stock with a little more salt
and pepper,
bring to a boil,  lower  the heat and cover the pan tightly. Simmer
gently for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours until the meat is very tender, adding
the mushrooms in the last 5-10 minutes.
