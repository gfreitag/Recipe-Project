Categories: Tex/mexican, Bread
Yield: 12 servings
2 T  Sugar
4 c  All purpose flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 ea OIL
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (110)
1 1/2 c  Milk
3 T  Lard or shortening
1 1/2 t  Salt
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In another bowl
combine milk, lard, salt and sugar. Heat to 110 degrees and add to
dissolved yeast. Beat in 3 cups of the all purpose flour and all of
the whole wheat flour. Add abut 1/2 c all purpose flour and mix until
a stiff sticky dough forms. Place dough on a floured board and knead,
adding more flour as needed, until dough is smooth and nonsticky.
Place doug in a greased bowl turning over to grease top. Cover and
let stand at room temp. 1 hour. Punch dough down. The dough may be
coverec and chilled as long as overnight. Knead dough on alightly
floured board to expel air. Roll dough out, a portion at a time, to
slightly less than 1/8" thick. Cut in 2"X 5" rectangles or 3" squares
for appetizers. Place on lightly floured pans and lightly cover. If
you work quickly you can let cut sopaipillas stay at room temp up to
5 min; otherwise, refrigerate them until all are ready to fry. In a
deep wide frying pan or kettle heat 1 1/2 - 2 inches oil to 350 on a
deep fat frying thermometer. Fry 2 or 3 at a time. When the bread
begins to puff, gently push the bread into the hot oil several times
to help it puff more evenly. Turn several times and cook just until
pale gold on both sides, 1-2 minutes total. Drain on paper towels.
Serve immediately or place in a warm oven until all are fried. Or if
made ahead, cool, cover and chill or freeze. To reheat, bake
uncovered in a 300 oven, turnig once, just until warm, 5-8 min. Do
not overheat or they will become hard.Makes 2 dozen large sopaipillas
or about 4 dozen small ones.
