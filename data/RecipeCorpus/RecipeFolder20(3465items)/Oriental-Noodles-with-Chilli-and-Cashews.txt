MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
3/16 c  Malt vinegar
1/16 c  Cashew paste
1/3 tb Lime juice
1/3 ts Lime rind
1/3    Red Chilli
3/16 c  Roasted Cashews
1/3 ts Vegetable oil
1/3 sm Red chilli
1/3    Spring onion
83 1/3 g  Snow peas
3/16 ts Sesame oil
1/16 c  Light soy sauce
Preparation: Lightly beat the eggs (keep the 4 and the 1 separate)

Finely chop one of the chillis, and the spring onion. Thinly slice
the snow peas. Finely shred the lime rind and the second red chilli.

As an alternative to making your own noodles, chinese thread noodles
are a suitable (but not as nice!) substitute, as is tagliatelle.

1. To make the noodles sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
Make a well in the centre and add the 4 beaten eggs, gradually
importing into the flour with a fork. Turn onto a lightly
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5
minutes). Cover and stand for 30 minutes.

2. Divide the dough into 4 portions. Cover with a tea towel. Roll one
portion of the dough to 3mm thickness using a rolling pin or sharp
knife. Roll up the sheet of pasta completely and cut into 5mm wide
strips. Carefully unroll the strands.

Repeat the process with the remaining portions of dough. Spread
onto
a dry tea towel and sprinkle with plain flour. Set aside.

3. Prepare the sauce whilst the pasta is standing. Heat the oil in a
pan
and add the chilli, spring onion and snow peas. Cook over a low
heat
for 2-3 minutes. Add the sesame oil , soy sauce, vinegar, cashew
paste,
lime juice and rind. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring, over a gentle
heat for 3-4 minutes.

4. Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling water until just tender.
Drain, spoon over the sauce and toss to combine. Sprinkle over
shredded chilli, cashews and serve.
