Title: Jerry Elliott's Spaghetti Sauce
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Beef, Pork, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 ds Ground cloves (or to taste)
1    Chopped onion
1    Chopped green pepper
1    6 oz can tomato paste
1    2.5# can Ital tomatoes+juic
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Basil
Several cloves sliced garlic
1/2 lb Hamburger
1/2 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
3    Slices chopped bacon
1 ts Salt (or to taste)
1 ts Pepper (or to taste)
1/2 lb Italian sausage
1/4 c  Wine (or to taste)
1 tb Olive oil
1 ds Cinnamon (or to taste)
Saute bacon and some onion in oil.  Then add beef, sausage, green
pepper and the rest of the onion.  Cook until meat is browned.  Then
add mushrooms, tomatoes (with juice), bay leaf and seasonings.
Simmer for 1 hour.  Add tomato paste and wine and simmer for another
30 minutes. If your sauce winds up being a little runny, add some
more tomato paste or let simmer uncovered till desired consistency is
achieved. I rarely make this recipe the same way twice.  It's a very
forgiving recipe and experimentation is reccommended.  Try adding a
dash of Worchestershire sauce and/or a dash of bitters.  Add some
oregano, whatever you like. This recipe also doubles very easily. The
amount of garlic was purposely vague as I'm one of those people who
feel that you can never have enough garlic. If you're not a
garlic-aholic, you probably will only need one clove of garlic. This
was given to me by my father Jerry Elliott. ~- Hunter Elliott
