Servings:  6

In a large, heavy frying pan, combine pork with cold water and heat to
boiling point.  Add onion, celery, pepper, bay leaf, savoury,
rosemary, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Cook, covered, over medium-low heat
for 1 1/2 hours, adding more water if mixture dries out.  Halfway
through cooking time, season with salt to taste.  Stir in rolled oats
and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.

Meanwhile, line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.  When meat mixture is
lukewarm, spoon into pie shell and cover with remaining pastry. Trim
pastry, seal edges and cut steam vents in top crust.  Decorate with
pastry cutouts as desired.  Bake in preheated 425 deg F oven for 15
minutes, then reduce heat to 375 deg F and bake another 25 minutes or
until crust is golden.
