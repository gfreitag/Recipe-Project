Title: Strawberry Frozen Yogurt
Categories: Fruit, Dessert
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 t  Salt
1/8 c  Sieved frozen Strawberries
1 1/2 T  Lemon Juice
1/2 c  Whipping cream, whipped
2 t  Gelatin

Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir
until gelatin is completely dissolved. Combine yogurt, sugar, and
salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in berries and lemon juice. Chill
until slightly thickened; beat until foamy. Fold in whipped cream.

NOTE: I have also made this with approx 1/2 of 1 pint of fresh
strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream
maker. Delicious!
