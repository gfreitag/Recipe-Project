Tapenade is a wonderful olive sauce from the south of France. It is
delicious on French bread or with crudites and can also make a
delicious sauce for grilled meats and fish.

PLACE EVERYTHING IN A BLENDER except the basil and blend on high
speed. Add more olive oil if too thick. Pour into a bowl and stir in
the basil. This will keep for 10 days.
