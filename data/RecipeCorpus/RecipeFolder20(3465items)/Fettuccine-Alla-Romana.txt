Title: Fettuccine Alla Romana
Categories: Italian
Yield: 4 servings
Cheese
1 tb Salt
1 lb Fresh fettuccine
Salt and pepper
1/2 lb Butter, softened
1    Egg yolk
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Freshly grated parmesan
Beat butter until light & fluffy.

Slowly add the egg yolk & cream, beating constantly.

Add grated cheese, a few tablespoons at a time, beating after each
addition.

In a large pan, bring approximately 8 quarts of water to boil; add
salt & very gently drop in the Fettuccine.

Stir with a wooden spoon for a few moments to separate the noodles, &
cook for about 7 minutes, or until tender. The pasta should be al

Drain the fettuccine into a colander and place in a large heated
serving bowl.

Add the creamed butter & cheese immediately; toss very gently & season
generously with salt & pepper.

Enjoy! - Jeff Duke
