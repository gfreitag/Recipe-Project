1    -Bay leaf, some thyme,
-Basil or marjoram)
6 lb Ripe, sweet tomatoes
3 tb Virgin olive oil
1 sm Red onion; thinly sliced
1 sm Rosemary branch; the leaves
This is a delicious simple sauce that can be served with your favorite
fresh pasta.

WASH THE TOMATOES WELL; then cut them into sixths or, if they are
large, into eighths. Warm the olive oil in a large, flat
stainless-steel or non-stick pan; add the tomatoes, onion, salt to
taste and rosemary. Cook over gentle heat until the skins are
wrinkled and have really cooked away from the flesh, about 30
minutes. The tomatoes should be melting into a puree. Pass them
through a food mill. Check the consistency; if you wish a thicker
sauce, return it to the pan and cook over medium-low heat until it is
the thickness you like. Add salt to taste and process in jars,
according to canning directions, or freeze.
