Title: Protein Pancakes
Categories: Breakfast, Pancakes
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 t  Baking Soda
1 1/2 c  Milk (or more)
2 x  Eggs
3 T  Plain Yogurt
2 T  Light Sesame Oil
1 1/2 c  Unbleached (wheat) Flour
1/2 c  Bran
1/4 c  Rolled Oats  *
1/4 c  Soy Flour(in health stores)
1 t  Baking powder
*  ground in blender, or 1/4 c Cornmeal
The addition of soy flour or powder to these pancakes boosts the
protein content.
Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Beat the liquid ingredients (incl
2 T of the oil) together and add them to the dry mixture. Stir to mix
well, mashing out the lumps with a wooden spoon. Add more liquid if
necessary; the batter should pour off the spoon slowly but smoothly.
You can use water instead of milk after you've added the first 1 1/2
cups of milk. Brush a hot skillet with oil or butter. The skillet
should be well greased. Heat the skillet and cook the pancakes on the
1st side over med-hi heat until the surface bubbles; turn and cook
briefly on the 2nd side. Transfer to warm plate.  Makes 12 pancakes.
