Suppli al Telefono To quote the author, "It is not easy to make
Suppli al Telefono. Nevertheless, it pays to make the effort once in
awhile because this dish always makes family and guests happy. The
name comes from the fact that a thread of cheese will spin between
your mouth and the suppli while you are eating it, resembling the
mouthpiece of an early model telephone from the time this dish was
first created. Suppl can be served as an appetizer, as a side dish in
a dairy meal, or as a meal in itself for a lunch or brunch. ...Suppli
should be served piping hot. Tell your guests, who might have never
had them before, that suppli should be eaten with the fingers." Place
rice, onion and olive oil in 2 qt saucepan and saute 2 or 3 minutes,
stirring frequently. Add salt and 3 1/2 cups hot water. Bring to a
boil. Lower heat to minimum and cook, covered, without stirring, 15
minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, uncovered, 5 minutes longer, stirring
frequently. The rice should now be quite dry. Remove from heat and
cool for 15 to 20 minutes, add eggs and mix well. With damp hands,
shape heaping tablespoons of the mixture into croquettes the size of
a large egg; insert one piece of cheese into each croquette,
