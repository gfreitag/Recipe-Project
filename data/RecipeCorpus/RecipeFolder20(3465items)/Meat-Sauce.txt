* Olio di Arrosto literally means "oil from a roast"."But  "oil from a
roast" can be misleading, since one might associate it with the fatty
drippings from an oven roast. Nothing could be further from the
truth. "Oil from a roast" is the oil that is used to pan roast very
lean meats such as veal, lamb loaf etc. These pan roasted meats must
be so lean that when they go into the pan that when they are cooked
the remaining oil is as clear as when you started....Sometimes,
however, you may find that a recipe you want to make lists olio di
arrosto, but you don't have any on hand. In that case, rather than
giving up trying your recipe until you make a a pan roast, prepare
the following substitute."

Olio di Arrosto: Heat the oil with all the other ingredients and cook,
stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes or until garlic is quite brown. Add a few
drops of water or white to produce the steam which will bind the
flavours to the oil. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard the
garlic and fresh herbs by simply lifting them with a fork. If you
used dried herbs, strain the oil, but be sure that the salt and
pepper are not removed. Note: You may add a shank bone or any other
bone for a more authentic flavor. YIELDS: 1/2 CUP
