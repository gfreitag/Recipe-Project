Categories: Cheese/eggs, Main dish, Sweetpotato, Tex/mexican, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Red Chiles; Ground
1/4 ts Salt
2    Green Onions/Tops; Sliced
1 1/2 c  Sweet Potatoes, Diced, Raw
4    Bacon; Slices, Cut Up
6    Eggs; Large, Beaten
Heat enough salted water to cover the sweet potatoes, (1/4 Tsp of
salt to 1 cup of water) to boiling.  Add the potatoes and cover.
Heat to boiling again and then reduce the heat.  Simmer until
potatoes are tender, about 6 minutes and drain.  Cook the bacon in a
10-inch skillet until crisp, remove and drain on paper towels.  Drain
the excess fat from the skillet reserving 1 Tbls in the skillet.
Stir in the potatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently,
until golden brown.  Mix the eggs, ground red chiles and salt.  Pour
the mixture into the skillet.  Sprinkle the mixture with the bacon
and onions.  As mixture begins to set on the bottom and sides, raise
it so that the uncooked egg mixture flows underneath the cooked. Cook
until the eggs are cooked all the way through but still moist, about
3 to 5 minutes.
