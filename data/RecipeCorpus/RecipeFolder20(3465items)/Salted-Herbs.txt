Title: Salted Herbs
Categories: Canadian, Herbs/spice
Yield: 5 servings
1 c  Grated carrots
1 c  Chopped celery leaves
1 c  Chopped green onions
1/4    To 1/2 cup coarse salt
1 c  Chopped fresh chives
1 c  Chopped fresh savoury
1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1 c  Chopped fresh chervil
These seasonings seem to be added to a lot of traditional French-
Canadian recipes. "Herbs preserved with vegetables and salt make a
lively seasoning for soups-particularly pea soup - sauces, stews and
omelettes.  A commercial brand, Les Herbes Salees du bas du fleuve,
is marketed by J.Y. Roy of St. Flavie, Quebec.  This recipe comes
from the Metis district."

In a large bowl, combine herbs and vegetables.  Layer 1 inch of herb
mixture in the bottom of a crock or glass bowl and sprinkle with some
of the salt.  Repeat layers until all of the herb mixture and salt is
used. Cover and refrigerate for 2 weeks. Drain off accumulated liquid
and pack herb mixture into sterilized jars.  Refrigerate until ready
to use.  Makes about 5 to 6 cups.
