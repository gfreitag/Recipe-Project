To quote the author, "This is one of those recipes one should watch
while it is being prepared because the actual preparation is much less
complicated than its description. A pasta machine would be helpful
because the actual preparation is much less complicated than its
description. Prim is the time when Italian-Jewish housewives display
their artistry and patience in making the most varied types of sweets
to make this joyous holiday especially festive.

Lightly beat eggs and salt together. Gradually add 1 1/4 to 1 1/2
cups of flour and mix until a rather soft dough is formed. Knead for
1 minute, then roll out as thin as you can. With a pizza cutter or
with a very sharp knife, make 24 2"x6" strips. Heat the oil in a
small frying pan until a piece of dough dropped into it sizzles
immediately. Holding one strip of dough at one end with your hand,
plunge the other end of the strip into the hot oil 1 inch deep. At
once insert the frying part of the strip between the prongs of the
fork with your other hand. Roll the fork in a counterclockwise motion
while letting the rest of the strip slide into the oil. The strip
will fry while it is rolling around the fork. When the manicotto is
golden, hold it above the pan a few seconds to drip, then gently
place on a paper towel. Repeat until all the manicotti are done. Heat
half the honey in a small saucepan. As it starts to boil, drop 2 to 3
manicotti in it for a few seconds to be coated with honey. Lower the
heat and continue to dip the manicotti in the hot honey sauce until
all have been coated, gradually adding additional honey. Cool
thoroughly before serving. YIELDS: 24
