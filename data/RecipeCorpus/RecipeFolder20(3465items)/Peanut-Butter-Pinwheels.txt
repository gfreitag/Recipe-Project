Title: Peanut Butter Pinwheels
Categories: Candy
Yield: 48 servings
4 c  Icing Sugar
1 c  Peanut Butter
1/2 c  Cold Mashed Potatoes
1/8 t  Salt
1/2 t  Vanilla
In a medium mixing bowl, combine cold mashed potatoes with salt and
vanilla. Add icing sugar, one cup at a time, beating after each
addition. At first the mixture will be stiff and hard to handle but
with beating it will become very runny. With the addition of the
fourth cup, the mixture will firm up again. Turn half of the mixture
on to a board that's been lightly dusted with icing; roll into a
rectangle two inches thick. Spread with half of the peanut butter.
Roll up from the short side, jelly-roll fashion. Repeat with rest of
fondant. Refrigerate until firm; slice 1/4 inch thick. Makes 4 dozen
candies. From The Gazette, 91/02/27.
