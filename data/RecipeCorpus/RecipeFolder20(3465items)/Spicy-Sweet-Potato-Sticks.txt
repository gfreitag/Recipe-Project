Title: Spicy Sweet-Potato Sticks
Categories: Vegetable, Side dish, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
Salt
White pepper
Ground ginger
Ground cardamom
Ground cloves
3 x  Large sweet potatoes
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Water (or as needed)
3 tb Honey
The potatoes should weigh a total of about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds.
======================================================================

Pare the sweet potatoes and cut into short sticks about 1/4" thick
(if you have a food processor with a disk designed for french fries,
use that).

Heat the oil and butter in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat;
don't let the fat brown.  Add the potato sticks and toss to coat;
season with salt, white pepper, about 1/4 ts each of ginger,
cardamom, and a small pinch of cloves.  Add 1/2 cup water, adjust the
heat to medium-low, and cook, tossing often, but gently, for about 5
minutes, adding drops of water if needed to prevent sticking.

Add the honey and continue to toss-cook until the sticks are just
tender and nicely glazed, perhaps 3 minutes.  Check the seasonings
and serve promptly.

SWEET POTATO STICKS WITH ORANGE AND HONEY:

Omit the ginger, cardamom, and cloves; cook the potatoes with 1 tb of
freshly grated orange zest (colored rind only, no pith) and, if you
have it, 2 tb of candied orange peel.  I don't recommend this unless
you have homemade candied peel -- science has not yet detected any
flavor in the kind sold in supermarkets.
