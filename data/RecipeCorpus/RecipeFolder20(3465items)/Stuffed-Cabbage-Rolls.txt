Categories: German, Vegetable, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
2 ea Eggs; large, slightly beaten
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 c  Parsley; fresh, minced
2 1/2 lb Cabbage
1 x  Cheesecloth; about 6 ft.
2 1/2 c  Tomatoes; canned, chopped
1/2 c  Vermouth; dry
1/2 c  Beef broth
2 T  Tomato paste
1/2 t  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Brown rice
3 c  Water
2 t  Salt
1 t  Dillseed
1/2 t  Marjoram
3/4 t  Pepper
2 1/2 c  Onion; chopped
5 T  Vegetable oil
1/2 t  Paprika
2 ea Garlic; cloves, minced
In a medium bowl cover brown rice with hot water and soak for 3 hours.
Drain.  In a 2-quart saucepan combine rice, 3 cups water, and 1 1/2 t
salt. Simmer covered for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.
Add the dillseed, marjoram, and 1/2 t pepper. In a large skillet
saute 1 1/2 cups chopped onion in 3 T hot vegetable oil until soft,
about 6 to 8 minutes. Add paprika and garlic, continue cooking and
stirring for 2 minutes. Stir in the rice mixture, eggs, bread crumbs,
and parsley. Adjust seasonings to taste.  Core cabbage and, in a
large pot, blanch the cabbage cored-side-down in boiling salted water
for 5 minutes or until it is softened.  Drain.  Remove 12 leaves and
cut off one fourth of each leaf from the base. Arrange 1 leaf
curved-side down on a square of dampened cheesecloth and place 3 T of
rice mixture in the center. Wrap the leaf around the filling and
twist the corners of the cheesecloth to form the leaf into a roll.
Continue making rolls with remaining filling. Chop remaining cabbage
to make 3 cups and, in a large frypan, saute with 1 cup chopped
onions and 2 T vegetable oil until soft. Add tomatoes, vermouth,
broth, tomato paste, sugar, 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper. Simmer the
mixture for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasonings.
Transfer cabbage-tomato sauce mixture to a large baking dish.
Arrange the cabbage rolls close together in one layer on the sauce.
Spoon some of the mixture over the rolls. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1
1/2 hours. Baste rolls 4 to 5 times during cooking. Let the dish cool.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.  Remove cheesecloth.
Heat in preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes before serving.
