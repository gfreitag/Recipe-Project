++++++++++++++++++ Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the
larger half, on a lightly floured surface, to a 13-inch circle. Line
a 9-inch pie plate with the pastry and trim the pastry 1/2 inch
beyond the rim of the pie plate. Combine the raisins, brown sugar,
corn starch and drink mix in a 3-quart saucepan.  Stir in the water
and lemon juice.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
the mixture boils and thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the
walnuts. Turn the mixture into the pastry-lined pie plate and dot
with the butter.  Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle.
Place the top crust over filling and trim the edge to 1-inch beyond
the rim.  Fold the top crust under the bottom crust and form a ridge.
Flute the edge and cut steam vents in the top crust. Bake in a
preheated 400 degree F. oven for 30 minutes or until the crust is a
golden brown and the filling is bubbly.  Cool on a wire rack.
