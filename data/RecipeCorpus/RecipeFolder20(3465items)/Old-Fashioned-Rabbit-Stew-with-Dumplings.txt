Wipe meat pieces and place in large casserole or Dutch oven. Add
onions, bay leaves, pepper, salt, thyme, tarragon; cover with water;
cover and cook over medium heat 1 1/2 hours. Tip cover as heat
increases. Do not boil strongly.

Add carrot pieces and potatoes. Increase heat slightly. Replace
tilted lid while you make dumplings.

Combine flour, suet, salt and pepper, parsley and baking powder in
small boal and mix. Add enough cold water just to pull together into
a soft dough with your hands. Do not kneed or squeeze the dough.
Divide into 6-8 small portions and drop onto top of gently boiling
cooking liquid. Replace lid tightly; cook 20 minutes more at a medium
boil. DO NOT RAISE LID.

Use slotted spoon to remove dumplings and meat pieces; keep warm
while you slightly thicken remaining liquid if desired - either by
adding a little flour and water or by boiling uncovered for a few
minutes (if boiling, remove carrots and potatoes with meat).
