another 5 minutes. Remove mixture from heat, let cool and transfer to
a mixing bowl. Add herbs, ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, and sour
cream. Mix thoroughly.
Season with salt and pepper. Veal: With a sharp knife, cut a pocket
in the veal breast or leg.  Fill with stuffing; close opening with
toothpicks. (Tie with string if necessary.) Rub outside with salt and
pepper. Heat oil in a Dutch oven.  Place meat in the pan and bake in
a preheated 350 degree F. oven about 1 1/2 hours. Bast occasionally
with beef broth. When done, place meat on a preheated platter.  Pour
rest of beef broth into the Dutch oven and scrape brown particles
from the bottom. Bring pan drippings to a simmer. Thoroughly blend
cornstarch with sour cream and add to pan drippings while stirring
cook and stir until thick and bubbly. Slice veal breast and serve
sauce separately.
