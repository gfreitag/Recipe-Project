Title: Lemon Butter Hollandaise
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Butter, room at temperature
3 pn Cayenne pepper
Lemon slice (opt)
Paprika
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 ts Black peppercorns
3    Blades mace
2 lg Egg yolks
Put lemon juice, peppercorns and mace into a small saucepan. Bring to
a boil and boil until liquid is reduced by half. In a bowl, combine
egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of butter and beat well.

Strain hot lemon liquid into butter mixture, beating constantly with a
wooden spoon. Place pan over a very low heat and gradually add small
pieces of remaining butter, whisking well until sauce is thickened
and smooth. (If mixture gets too hot at this stage it will curdle and
separate. To prevent this from happening, keep removing pan from heat
while beating in butter to ensure gentle cooking.)

Add cayenne pepper to sauce and mix well. Turn mixture into a warm
serving dish. Garnish with lemon slice, if desired, and sprinkle with
paprika.

Makes 2/3 cup.

NOTE: This rich egg and butter sauce requires great care during
cooking to achieve delicious results. Serve warm or cold with poached
salmon, asparagus or globe artichokes.
