This pungent Jamaican sauce can be used to marinate pork butts (makes
em run faster), beef round roasts, porgies, red snapper, as well as
chicken. Says Vernon, "You can even use my sauce like ketchup. One
guy pours it on his scrambled eggs." The sauce keeps well in the
refrigerator tightly covered.

JERK SAUCE

* Pulverize the onions, chiles, and ginger in a blender or food
processor. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the
allspice, thyme, black pepper, vinegar, and soy sauce.

* Coat the chicken with the sauce.  Cover and marinate in the
refrigerator for 24 hours, turning once.

* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place a meat thermometer in one
of the thigh pieces.  Place a shallow pan of boiling water on the
oven floor. Put the chicken on a rack and place in a roasting pan.
Roast, basting frequently with the sauce, until three-quarters cooked
(120 degrees on the meat thermometer), 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the
chicken from the oven. Remove the meat thermometer

* Preheat a broiler or grill

* Baste the chicken with more jerk sauce.  Sear the chicken for 5
minutes under a preheated broiler or over a very hot charcoal fire.
Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes before eating

* Serves 6

NOTE: Be sure to wear rubber gloves when handling these very hot
peppers. If you don't you could irritate and burn your skin. Keep
your gloves away from your face and eyes.
