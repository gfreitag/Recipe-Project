Try this with white peaches, if available, for a subtle variation on
the original.

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F and set a rack in the middle level. Rinse,
halve and pit the peaches. Puree 2 of the peach halves in a food
processor. Place the puree in a bowl and add the sugar, crushed
macaroons and the egg yolk. Cover each peach half with this filling
and place the peach halves in a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle the
remaining butter over the peaches and bake for about 30 minutes,
until the peaches are baked through and the filling is a deep golden
color. Serve hot or at room temperature.
