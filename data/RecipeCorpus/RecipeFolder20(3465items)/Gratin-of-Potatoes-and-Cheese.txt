cold water). ~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Rub the bottom and sides of a gratin dish with the cut sides of the
garlic.  Leave the garlic in the dish. Cover with a layer of potatoes.
Sprinkle with some salt and freshly ground pepper and cheese. Pour
some cream over the whole thing.  Repeat until all the potatoes,
cream, and cheese are used.  Place the pan, uncovered in the oven.
(Put a baking sheet underneath to catch spills.) Bake for 1 hour or
more, until the top is browned and the cream has cooked down to a
thick sauce. During the first 1/2 hour of cooking, use a broad
spatula to push the top layers of potatoes into the cream every once
in a while.  Serve hot, at room temerature or cold.
