NOTE:  To make a Rich Chicken Stock strain the basic stock, then
continue simmering it until evaporation reduces the liquid by half.
For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup Rich Stock, start it with
at least 2 cups of strained basic stock. dark meat, cut into 1/2-inch
cubes. Directions: Place in the hot water, oil and salt in a large
pot over high heat; and cover and bring to a boil.  When water
reaches a rolling boil, add small amounts of spaghetti at a time to
the pot, breaking up oil patches as you drop the spaghetti in.
Return to boiling and cook to al dente stage, do not over cook.(To
test doneness of spaghetti, cut a strand in half near the end of
cooking time.  When done, there should be only a speck of white in
the center, less than one-fourth the diameter of the strand.) Do not
overcook. During this cooking time, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon
to lift spaghetti out of the water by spoonfuls and shake strands
back into the boiling water.  (It may be an old wives' tale, but this
procedure seems to enhance the spaghetti's texture.)
Then immediately drain spaghetti into a collander; stop cooking
process by running cold water over strands. (If you used dry
spaghetti, first rinse with hot water to wash off starch.) After the
pasta has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a liberal
amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss spaghetti. Set aside
still in the colander.
Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a
small bowl and set aside.
In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1-1/2 sticks of the butter, the
onions and garlic cloves; saute over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Add the minced garlic and seasoning mix; continue
cooking over medium heat until onions are dark brown, but not burned,
about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add 2-1/2 cups of the stock,
the Worcestershire and Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook about
8 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the tomato sauce and bring mixture
to a boil. Then stir in the sugar and 1 cup of the green onions;
gently simmer uncovered about 40 nminutes, stirring occasionally.

ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix in a small bowl; mix well.
Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it in with your hands. In a large
skillet melt 1-1/2 sticks of the butter over medium heat. Add the
remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat about 3
minutes. Add the chicken and continue cooking 10 minutes, stirring
frequently. When the tomato sauce has simmered about 40 minutes, stir
in the chicken mixture and heat through.
To finish the dish, for each serving melt 2 tablespoons butter in
a large skillet over medium heat. Add one-sixth of the cooked
spaghetti (a bit less than a 2 cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute,
stirring constantly.  Add 1-1/4 cups chicken and sauce and 2
tablespoons of remaining stock; heat throughly, stirring frequently.
Remove from heat. Roll spaghetti on a large fork and lift onto a
heated serving plate. Repeat process for remaining servings. From
