1 well; vinegar into 1 well and melted butter into the third. Pour
water over all. Beat with a wooden spoon until well blended. Pour
batter into a greased 9-inch square baking pan. Bake in a preheated
350 degree F. oven for 25 minutes or until cake tests done.  Cool in

MOCHA CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Combine confectioners' sugar, cocoa,
softened butter, coffee, and vanilla in a mixing bowl.  Beat, with an
electric mixer set at medium speed, until smooth. NOTE; This recipe
came from a very old church cookbook that the woman found and is
typical of many of the recipes of the 1800's. The vinegar was used to
keep the cake from spoiling. Try this and I think that you will like
it.
