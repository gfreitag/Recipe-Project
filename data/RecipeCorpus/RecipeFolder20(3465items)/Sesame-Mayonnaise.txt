Title: Sesame Mayonnaise
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
-(preferably safflower)
1/4 c  Sesame oil
1    Egg yolk
2 ts Lemon juice
2 ts Soy sauce
Mix shredded chicken with this and some minced scallions, sliced water
chestnuts and toasted sesame seeds, and you have an instant Sesame
Chicken Salad.

WHISK THE YOLK, lemon juice and soy sauce together. Add the vegetable
oil drop by drop, very slowly, while whisking vigorously. Once you
obtain a thick, emulsified mixture, you may begin adding the oil more
quickly, by spoonfuls. Continue whisking until all the vegetable and
sesame oil is incorporated. (This may also be prepared in a food
processor or blender--just remember to add the oil very slowly at the
beginning.)

Makes 1 Cup
