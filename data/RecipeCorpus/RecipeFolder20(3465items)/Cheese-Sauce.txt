Salsa di Formaggi "This recipe lists the cheese one should use for
this very versatile sauce However, it can be prepared, as I often do,
with any kind of cheese. Leftover cheeses are perfect for it."

In a heavy bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the
flour, and stir till well combined with butter. Add hot milk all at
once and keep stirring until the sauce is smooth and thick. Add the
cheeses and stir until all the bits are melted. Keep warm until you
are ready to use it. NOTE: If you don't use the sauce right away, you
may keep it in the refrigerator for one day. Then leave it at room
temperature for several hours before placing it over very low heat
and stirring constantly to make sure that it does not stick to the
bottom of the pan and burn. YIELDS: ABOUT 3 CUPS
