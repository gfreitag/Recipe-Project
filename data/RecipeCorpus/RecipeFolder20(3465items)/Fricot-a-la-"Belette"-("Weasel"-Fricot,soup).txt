"If there was one dish that could be called typically Acadian, it
would certainly be Fricot, a soup containing potatoes and meat. The
dish has been a long time favorite in Acadian households, so much
that the word fricot was once synomous with a good meal and a common
call for dinner was often, "Vous etes invites au fricot!"... This
potato fricot was prepared when neither meat nor fish were available,
and given the tongue-in-cheek name, "Weasel Fricot" (Fricot a la
Belette). If you ask Acadians about the origin of the name, they will
smile and say, "Parce que b'lette a passe tout drouete (Because the
weasel went right on by.)

On Prince Edward it is called Fricot a la bezette (Ninicompoop Fricot)
where bezette roughly translates as "nincompoop". It is known as
butter fricot, salted her fricot and potato fricot, and is often
served with a large slice of buttered bread and molasses."

Handkerchief Dumplings (Pates en Mouchior de Poche) Mix flour with
salt. Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making
biscuits. Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and
place the squares in the fricot. Cover and simmer 7 minutes.

Saute the onion and salted herbs in butter for 1-2 minutes or until
the onion is golden brown. Add the water, potatoes, salt and pepper,
and simmer for 20 minutes. To thicken the broth, add dumpling or
flour mixed with water.
