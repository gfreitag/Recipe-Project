Title: Shami Kebab
Categories: Main dish, Beef, Asian
Yield: 7 servings
2 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
3 c  Water
1    Onion, chopped
1/3 c  Ciliantro, chopped
3    Green chillies, chopped
1/2 c  Liquid egg substitute
1 lb Lean ground beef
1/2 c  Dhal or dried split peas
1 ts Cumin seed
1    1 in cinnamon stick
6    Whole cloves
1    1 in ginger root, peeled
8    Cloves garlic
Soak dhal (or dried peas) in water for 10 minutes, then drain. Put 3
cups water in a large skillet, and boil the ground beef, dhal or
peas, and next 7 ingredients approximately 45 minutes, or until all
liquid evaporates.

When all of the liquid has evaporated, allow mixture to cool
slightly. Add liquid egg substitute. Then grind the meat mixture to a
fine paste. This can be done in a blender or food processor, the
liquid egg substitute providing the moisture.

After the mixture has been made into paste, add the chopped onion,
coriander leaves and chillies.

Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil, or spray with noncaloric
spray to prevent sticking. Measure 1/4-cup portions onto the cookie
sheet and shape them into patties.

Bake in 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until set. Remove
carefully from pan with spatula. Use a grill on a hot summer day!
