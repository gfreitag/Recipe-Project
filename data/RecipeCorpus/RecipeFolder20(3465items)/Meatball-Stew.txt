~----------------- Prepare basic meatballs except -- cook in a Dutch
oven. Drain off excess fat.  Add the remaining ingredients and heat
to boiling. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally,
until the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.  Remove the bay
leaf and serve. NOTE: You can substitute 1 24-oz package of frozen
stew vegetables for stew for the carrots, celery and potatoes.
