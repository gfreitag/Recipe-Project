1 t  Black pepper
1/2 t  Salt

MMMMM----------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------------
6 c  Basic chicken stock
1 c  Pan drippings from chicken
8 ea Gingersnap cookies
1 t  Light brown sugar, to taste
1 t  Ground ginger, to taste
2 T  Chicken, pork, or beef fat
2 T  Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
1/2 t  Minced garlic
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
Melt the fat and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When
almost melted, add the onions, celery, and garlic; saute 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Stir in the seasoning mix and cook 5 minutes
more, stirring occasionally. Add the stock and pan drippings; bring
to a boil over high heat and boil rapidly until liquid reduces to
about 1 quart, about 25 minutes. Then crumble the gingersnaps into
the stock mixture and whisk with a metal whisk until they are
dissolved. Continue cooking 10 minutes, whisking frequently and
making sure the gingersnaps are thoroughly dissolved. During this
time, taste the gravy; if the ginger flavour is not pronounced,m add
the 1 tablespoon brown sugar and the 1 teaspoon ginger or add both to
taste. Strain the gravy. Makes 2-1/2 to 3 cups. From Paul Prudhomme's
