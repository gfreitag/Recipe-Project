Title: Garlic Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  White vinegar
1 T  Lemon juice
3 T  Water
1 ea Large head of garlic
10 ea Slices white bread
1 c  Olive oil
Peel and crush the garlic, the entire head.  Remove the crusts from
the white bread, and place the crustless bread in a mixing bowl. Add
the garlic along with the olive oil and vinegar. Let this soften for
1 hour. Beat with an electric mixer until all is smooth. Don't do
this with a food processor as it will be too smooth. Add lemon juice,
slowly add water while the mixer is running so you will have a thick
and fluffy sauce.
