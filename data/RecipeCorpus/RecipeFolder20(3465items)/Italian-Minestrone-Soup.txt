Grated Parmesan Cheese
In a large pot, place the meat, water, salt, small onion, celery
leaves and bay leaf.  Cover and simmer for about 2-1/2 hours until
the meat is tender. Remove the meat.  Strain the broth (should
measure 2 quarts). Add ice cubes to the broth to harden the fat and
remove the fat.  Discard the fat. Finely dice the meat, discarding
any fat and bones (should be about 2 cups). In a 5 to 6 quart kettle
or Dutch oven, combine the beef broth and the meat. Place over low
heat while preparing the remaining ingredients. Pan fry the bacon
until crisp.  Add the bacon and the drippings and all the remaining
ingredients, except the Parmesan cheese, to the broth. Cover and
simmerfor about 30 minutes, until the vegetables and macaroni are
tender. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, if desired. From:
