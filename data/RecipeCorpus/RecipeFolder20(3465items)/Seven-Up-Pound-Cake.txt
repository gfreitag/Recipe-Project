2 tb Lemon Extract
1 c  7-Up (Room Temperature)
1 c  Regular Margarine
1/2 c  Shortening

This is an old recipe that comes from a request in the local paper for
"Classic Recipes".  They called the 7-Up bottling company and they
did not even know about it.  Someone developed this on their own and
never let the company know about it.  BTW 7-Up comes from the popular
card game in the 1930's.

Cream the margarine, shortening and sugar together beating until
light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, blending well after
each addition. Beat in the flour, then beat in the extract and 7-Up.
Blend well. Pour the batter into a well-greased and floured tube pan
and bake at 325 degrees F for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
