Title: Easy Chicken and Rice Casserole
Categories: Poultry, Rice, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
1 pk Lipton rice and sauce
4 x  Chicken (white or dark)
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
Uncle Ben's box or envelope of flavored rice (wild or pilaf, etc.)
can be substituted for Lipton's Rice 'n' Sauce, but if you use plain
white rice, use long cooking kind (not Minute) and you will have to
add spices to your taste:  curry, paprika, pepper, etc. whatever you
wish.  The small packets of Lipton's or Uncle Ben's usually have
their own flavor pak and no spices need to be added unless you like
extra pepper.  Combine dry rice, flavor pak if there is one, can of
cream of mushroom (or cream of chicken or cream of celery) soup, and
1/2 to 1 full can of water after that.  Stir well with fork as soup
will be lumpy.  Add washed and skinned pieces of chicken and sink
them down into the liquid.  Bake at 375 for 45 minutes to an hour
depending on type of rice--wild rice takes a little longer.  When
rice is done, chicken is done.  Watch during cooking and if rice
begins to dry out, add water.  If bake at 400 cooking time is less.
If mixture was relatively soupy before putting in oven, bake
uncovered, but if mixture was not very soupy bake covered.  The
soupier the mixture when goes in oven (how much water you added) the
less you will need to watch it while baking. If it is looking like it
is going to still be soupy towards time for it to get done, take
cover off.  One more thing, cleanup is easier if you sprayed baking
dish (glass) with Pam or other cooking spray before you put the
ingredients in the dish (sorry!)
