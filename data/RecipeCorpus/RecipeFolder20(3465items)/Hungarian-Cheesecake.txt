~----------------- Sift together the flour and baking powder, set
aside. Cream the butter in a large mixing bowl, then add the egg
yolks, salt, and lemon juice, mixing well. Add the dry mixture, then
using your fingers, work the dough into a smooth consistency.
Add the cold water as necessary to work the dough. Roll the dough
out on a flat surface to a thickness of 1/4-inch. Cut the dough to
fit the greased bottom of a 9-inch springform pan and place the dough
in the bottom. Use the excess to line the sides of the pan.
Chill. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Press the
cottage cheese through a sieve.  In a large mixing bowl, beat 3 eggs
and the sugar until well blended.  Add the cottage cheese and beat,
then stir in the lemon rind and the sour cream. Separate the
remaining egg, saving the yolk for another recipe, and brush the
crust with the white. Combine the pineapple and raisins in a bowl,
then spread the mixture evenly on the prepared crust. Pour the cheese
mixture on the top of the fruit mixture. Bake for 10 minutes at 450
degrees F. then reduce the oven to 350 degrees F. and bake for about
another 35 minutes. Cool to room temperature, then chill. Serve
chilled.
