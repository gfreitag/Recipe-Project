Title: Whole Wheat Batter Bread
Categories: Bread, Londontowne
Yield: 1 servings
3 T  Soya flour
3 c  Corn oil
3 pk Yeast
2 T  Salt
8 c  Whole wheat flour
4 T  Honey-molasses
3 T  Wheat germ
3 1/2 c  Very warm water
This recipe is for 2 loaves of bread. If one loaf is desired, use 2
packages yeast instead of 3 and cut all other ingredients in half.
Wheat germ and soya flour may be omitted. Put flour in oven to warm,
at lowest heat. In a VERY large bowl, dissolve yeast in 3/4 cup of
very warm water. Add honey to yeast. Coat loaf pans well with
margarine and flour. Add oil, 2-1/2 cups warm water, and 2T salt
yeast. Add about 4c flour mixture and beat at medium speed for 2
minutes. Gradually add more flour, beating well. Dough should be
sticky - if runny, add more flour. Put in pans, smoothing top and
making sure dough is pushed into corners. Cover with hot, wet towel
and let rise in warm place. Check bread in about 20 minutes and keep
checking to be sure dough doesn't rise over lip of pan. When dough
has risen ALMOST to lip of pan, bake at 450 degrees for about 40
mins. Remove from pan immediately and cool on rack. Mrs. William W.
