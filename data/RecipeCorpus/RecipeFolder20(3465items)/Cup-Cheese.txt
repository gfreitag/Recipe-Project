Categories: Penndutch, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 pn Salt
1 c  Cream
1 x  Egg
1 x  Thick milk **
1 t  Baking soda
1/2 lb Butter
** Thick milk is soured milk.
Scald thick milk by baking it at 350-F for a few minutes; allow to
remain long enough to bake the curds. Drain off the water, put curds
in an earthen vessel and keep at a moderately warm temperature (about
75-F). Each day for a week, add new baked curds. At the end of a
week, pour the curds into a heated pan and let simmer very slowly;
bring to a slow boil without any stirring. Add a pinch of salt, 1 tsp
of baking soda dissolved in 1 cup of fresh sweet cream and 1/2 pound
of butter. Stir the mixture; continue boiling for 15 minutes. Add 2
or 3 beaten eggs and pour mixture into small cheese cups.
