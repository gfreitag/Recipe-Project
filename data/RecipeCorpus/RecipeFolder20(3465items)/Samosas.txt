*GHEE is butter that has been cooked to separate the clear butter fat
from milk solids to be able to keep it for a long time. To make it,
cook 1 lb unsalted butter to a simmer and cook, partially covered, 10
to 15 minutes till most of the froth has subsided and the milk solids
on the bottom of the pan are browned but not burned. Turn it off and
allow it to cool a bit and separate. Strain it through several layers
of cheesecloth. Seal in plastic containers. It will keep several
weeks in the fridge. USE EITHER THE VEGETABLE OR MEAT FILLING,
Vegetable Filling: Heat a large frying pan and add the ghee,
potatoes, garlic, onion, and ginger. Cover and cook on low for 10
minutes, to sweat the potatoes down. Stir a few times. Don't brown.
Add the remaining ingredients and continue cooking, covered until the
potatoes and peas are tender, 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Meat
Filling: Saute all ingredients until they are crumbly and most of the
liquid is absorbed. Set aside to cool. Dough: Using a fork, blend the
flour, oil and salt. Add the water and knead to form smooth dough.
Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Wrap in plastic and
refrigerate for 1 hour. Knead the dough for 1 minute. Cut in half.
Cut each half into 12 pieces. Roll in 7" circles using additional
flour. Cut each circle in half. Roll sides together to make a cone.
Hold the cone in your hands, with the fingers wrapped around it. Fill
and seal with water into triangle. Fry in 2 inches of oil at 375F for
2-3 minutes per side. Drain. MAKES: 48 Samosas
