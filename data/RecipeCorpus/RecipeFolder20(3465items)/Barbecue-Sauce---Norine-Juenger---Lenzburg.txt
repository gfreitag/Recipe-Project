Title: Barbecue Sauce - Norine Juenger - Lenzburg
Categories: Bbq/grill, Salsa/sauce, Pork
Yield: 3 servings
1 T  Paprika
1 t  Dry mustard
1 t  Chili Powder
2 T  Chopped Green Onion Tops
1/8 t  Cayenne Pepper
16 oz Tomato Sauce
2 T  Brown Sugar

salt, paprika, mustard, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Simmer 15
minutes, stirring occasionally.
Serve hot.  Makes 2 1/2 cups. ***** While there was no indication, I
would expect that this is best with Pork, since the idea of 'BBQ' in
that area was nearly always pork.
