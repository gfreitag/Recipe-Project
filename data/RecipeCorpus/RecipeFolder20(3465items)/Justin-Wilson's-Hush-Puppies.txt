Title: Justin Wilson's Hush Puppies
Categories: Cajun/creol, Bread
Yield: 48 servings
1/2 t  Soda
1/2 c  Parsley, finely chopped
1 x  Deep fat for frying
2 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Plain flour
1 t  Baking powder
1 t  Salt
Combine all dry ingredients.  Add eggs, buttermilk, onions, and oil or
bacon drippings.  Mix well.  Drop in deep hot fat by spoonfuls and
brown on all sides. Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never
counted, so I don't know for sure.  But it sure does make a bunch.
The main reason why I said 48 is because the program, MenuMaster,
won't let you past that field unless you tell it something. Justin
Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that originated
after the Civil War. People didn't have enough for themselves to eat
let alone feed their dogs, so when the old hounds started barking
from hunger, they would throw pieces of fried corn bread to them,
yelling, 'Shut up, dog! Hush puppy!"
