"Today a nonstick frypan works well, but just as in the 30s, a black
cast iron one is great, too. Thicken the gravy with flour if desired.
... With the prairie sloughs dried up and little snow in the winter,
there were very few wild birds in the worst years of the 30s.
Stuffed, thinly pounded less-tender cuts of beef made an adequate
substitute. Some books called for flank steak, other for round steak.
Veal birds are similar, Rouladen, a German dish, is made with meat
spread with mustard and wrapped around dill pickle spears. And in
many regions of Canada, venison, moose and caribou were used in place
of beef. In Newfoundland, savory seasons the stuffing and salt pork
tops the meat rolls.

In a skillet, cook onion, celery and mushrooms in butter until
softened. Remove from heat; stir in bread crumbs, savory, thyme, salt
and pepper to taste and just enough water or stock to moisten.
Pound meat into 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 4 or 5 serving pieces;
spread with stuffing almost to edges. Roll up each from widest sides;
secure with string. In skillet, brown rolls in oil. Add stock; cover
and simmer for 1 hour, turning and basting occasionally, or bake in
325F oven for 1 hour. MAKES: 4 or 5 servings
