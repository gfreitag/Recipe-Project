++++++++++++++++++ Wash the lentils thoroughly.  In a 2 1/2-quart
saucepan bring 6 cups of water to a boil.
Add the lentils, bacon, leek or green onion, carrot and celery.
Simmer, partially covered, for 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile in a
frypan, saute chopped onion in vegetable oil until soft. Sprinkle
flour over onion, and stir.  Lower heat, stir constantly, and cook
until the flour turns a light brown.  DO NOT burn flour. Stir in 1/2
cup of hot lentil soup into the browned flour; beat with a wire whisk
until well-blended. Beat in vinegar. Add contents of frypan to lentil
pan and stir together. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until
lentils are soft.  Add the frankfurters and catsup. Cook to heat
frankfurters through. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot.
