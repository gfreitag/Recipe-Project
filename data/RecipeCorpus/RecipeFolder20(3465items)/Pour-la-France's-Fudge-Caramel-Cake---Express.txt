Title: Pour la France's Fudge Caramel Cake - Express
Categories: Cake/cookie, Tex/mexican, Dessert, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 10 servings
1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
2 t  Butter
1/8 t  Salt
1/3 c  Heavy Cream
2 ea 9-inch layers of choc. Cake
1 ea Fudge Icing (Recipe)
1 ea Caramel Sauce (Recipe)
1 1/2 c  Cashews, roasted, unsalted
2 c  Heavy Cream
2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate
FOR CAKE:
Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel
Sauce and Cashews.
Repeat with next 2 cake layers.  Place final cake layer on top,
frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover sides of cake
with chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil. Stir in
chocolate until melted and smooth. This will be very soft but will
harden when cooled. Refrigerate until workable consistency.
NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable consistency
depends on the weather.  This is much like making fudge candy. The
author, (Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day and
had no problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and
reduce to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter),
add cream. Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny
Mattingsley, of Pour la France, 7959 Broadway, San Antonio,
