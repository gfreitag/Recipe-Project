======================================================================
==== 每 Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in
onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent,
about 5 minutes. Add potato slices and broth; bring to a boil over
high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 15
minutes until potatoes are almost cooked through.  Add celery seed
and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently to break up the
potato slices.  Whisk gently with a baloon whisk until soup becomes
smoother, but small pieces of potato should remain.  Season with salt
and pepper.  If not serving immediately, you might want to add a
little buttermilk or extra chicken broth because soup will get
thicker as it stands. 每 Makes six 1-cup servings. 每
