Peel and remove all the green and pink portions from the rind of a
large watermelon.  Cut the rind into cubes or slices and measure 4
quarts. Drop the rind into a kettle of boiling water, boil for 5
minutes, and drain. Cool.  Dissolve 4 T Slaked lime (obtainable at
your drugstore) in 2 quarts cold water Pour the solution over the
watermelon rind and let rind stand for 3 hours.  Drain and rinse
thoroughly.  Cover the rind with clear cold water, bring to a boil
and boil until the rind is tender. Combine 2 cups sugar, 1 cup
vinegar, and 4 cups water. Add 2 T each of whole allspice and whole
cloves, 4 sticks cinnamon and 2 pieces of ginger root, all tied in a
bag.  Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes. Add the rind and 2 hot
peppers, bring agin to a boil, and simmer for 30 minutes. Let the
rind stand in the syrup in a cool place for 12 to 24 hours. Add 3
