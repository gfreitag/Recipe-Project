Time: :30 Cholesterol  per serving: 20 The roast should be slightly
frozen for best results in cutting, as this allows you to slice the
roast very thin. Place sliced roast in bowl with worcestershire sauce
for 15 to 20 minutes. While meat is marinating Saute onions, bell
peppers and 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt in peanut oil. Remove
vegetables from skillet and cook meat in skillet until just browned
adding remaining seasoning salt. Add the the onions and bell peppers
to meat and allow to cook for another 10 minutes. Place french bread
open face under heat under broiler until crisp. Place meat mixture on
top of the bread, cover with swiss cheese, and broil until cheese has
melted. Add mayonaise and serve with leftover juices. Mum-Mum-Mummmm.
