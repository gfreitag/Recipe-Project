Potage du Ble

This fresh corn soup from Renard Jacques, chef at Auberge Benedict
Arnold in St. Georges is rich and creamy. It may be made with frozen
or canned corn kernels,  but it won't have the same delicate
sweetness.

Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add milk, corn and salt;
cook just until corn is tender. Strain cooking liquid into a bowl and
set corn aside. Heat butter in same saucepan and saute celery, onion
and leek until softened. Blend in flour; cook until bubbly. Stir in
reserved corn cooking liquid. Bring to a boil, then partially cover
and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
Place corn and liquid in food processor or blender and puree in
batches until smooth. Return to saucepan and add cream. Adjust
seasonings with salt and pepper to taste. Reheat until piping hot.
