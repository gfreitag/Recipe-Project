Title: Tortilla Pinwheels
Categories: Appetizer, Tex/mexican
Yield: 12 servings
8    Flour tortillas, 8 to 10"
1/4 lb Thin sliced rst turkey*
8 oz Cream cheese, softened
1 1/8 ts Garlic power
3 tb Dried, minced onion
Soften cream cheese, drain can of chilies, set out other ingredients.
Place cream cheese, milk, garlic, onion flakes, and salt in bowl.
Beat until fluffy.  Stir in chilies and cilantro leaves.  Brush both
sides of a tortilla with water.  Spread one side of torilla with thin
layer of the cream cheese mixture.  Cover torilla with a layer of the
sliced meat. Roll up and place on plate, repeat.  Cover plate with
plastic wrap and refrigerate from 1 to 8 hours.  Cut into 1/2-inch
slices and serve. Makes about 4 dozen appetizers. * Pre-packaged
"Buddig" style meats work well for everyday occasions. # Many
supermarkets now carry small plastic containers of spices at one
price.  I've found that 1 container of cilantro (.15 oz) is
satisfactory for most occasions, even though less than 3
Tablespoons.
