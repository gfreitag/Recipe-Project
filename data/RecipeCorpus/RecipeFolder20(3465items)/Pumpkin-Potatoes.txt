The directions for this recipe are very loose; Boil together equal
parts of peeled potatoes and pumpkin. When cooked, drain them, add 1
good sized onion, finely chopped and a piece of butter. Mash all till
creamy, season to taste and serve with golden sliced of fried salt
pork or bacon. To quote Mme. Benoit, "Grand-mere was a wizard with
pumpkin. Her mashed potatoes pumpkin french fried chips were super.
It's amazing how most of what we enjoyed in our youth remains a
pleasure as we grow older. In the autumn of 1959 I made these on my
television show. The amount of mail requesting the recipe was
unbelievable!"
