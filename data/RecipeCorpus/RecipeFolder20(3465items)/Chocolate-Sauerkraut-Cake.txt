NOTE: This is one of those dishes that sound absolutely horrible, but
tastes great.  It is also one of those recipes that is a classic but
you can never find in most cookbooks. I have fooled my kids with this
as well as seen it done on TV.  Everyone thinks that the sauerkraut
is coconut. So be sure to rinse and drain the sauerkraut several
times when you make this recipe.
