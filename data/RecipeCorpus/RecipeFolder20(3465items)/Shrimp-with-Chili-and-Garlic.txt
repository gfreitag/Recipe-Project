MIX THE BATTER INGREDIENTS in a medium-sized bowl until thick and
smooth. Let the batter sit, covered, for at least 30 minutes. Combine
shrimp and batter. Heat a wok or large deep skillet until hot and add
the oil for frying. When the oil is barely smoking, deep-fry the
shrimp for 2 minutes or until the batter is just firm. You should do
this in several batches. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain
on paper towels. Heat a small saucepan and when hot, add the oil,
dried chiles and garlic. Stir for 30 seconds. Add remaining sauce
ingredients and simmer for 2 minutes. Keep warm. Reheat the oil in
the wok until it is very hot, but not smoking. Deep-fry the shrimp
again until they are golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove and
drain, place on a warm platter, drizzle with the sauce and serve
immediately.
