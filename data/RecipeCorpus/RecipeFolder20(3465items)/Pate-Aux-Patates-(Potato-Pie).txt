Pate aux Patates

This potato pie makes a warming supper dish. It was a Friday favorite
in the days when the meatless rule was observed in French Catholic
families, says Nicole Kretz.

Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry, Mash potatoes with enough milk
to make a smooth puree; add butter and 1 egg yolk. Combine potatoes
with onion, celery, parsley and savoury; season with salt and pepper
to taste.
Sprinkle potato mixture in pie shell. Cover with top crust, trim and
crimp edges to seal and cut steam vents. Brush top crust with
remaining egg yolk.bake pie in a preheated 400F oven for 30 to 40
minutes or until pastry is golden. SERVES: 6-8
