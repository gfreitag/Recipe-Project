long. Wrap completely in waxed paper or plastic wrap.
Refrigerate for 1 hour or longer.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

slice of dough in the bottom of each.  Overlap 5 slices around the
outside of each. Gently press together.  Pierce the bottoms and sides
with a fork.
Bake 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven until lightly browned.
Cool in the pans on a rack and gently remove the shells when cold to
the touch. FILLING: Cut each orange section into 3 pieces and set
aside.
Drain the pineapple, reserving the syrup.  Combine the pineapple
syrup, orange juice, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Stir in the rest
of the ingredients except the cheddar cheese, and cook, stirring
gently, over medium heat until the mixture thickens and bubbles. Stir
in the orange pieces and pineapple. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Spoon the chilled filling into the baked tart shells and sprinkle
each tart with about 1 Tbls of the cheddar cheese.
Refrigerate until serving time.
