Title: Honey Garlic Dressing
Categories: Salad
Yield: 5 servings
1 T  Fresh purred garlic
1/2 c  Honey
3/4 c  Tarragon
3/4 c  Red wine vinegar
3 ea Egg yolks
4 c  Olive oil
1 T  Paprika
1 T  Crushed black pepper
1 1/2 T  Salt
In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Slowly add the oil while
whisking to make a basic mayonnaise.  It will work only if you add
the oil very, very slowly at first. You can also use a food processor
to make this dressing, but again, you must add the oil ever so slowly
to get the desired consistency. Once the mayonnaise is made, add all
the ingredients except the vinegars. Make sure the the dressing is
well mixed and ingredients are evenly distributed throughout. Slowly
stir in the tarragon vinegar and then the red wine vinegar, making
sure that they are evenly blended.
This dressing must be stored in the fridge or it will spoil. Yield 5
cups
