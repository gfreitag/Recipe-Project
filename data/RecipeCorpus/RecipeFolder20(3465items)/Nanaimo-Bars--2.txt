MMMMM-------------------------TOP LAYER------------------------------

4 oz Semisweet chocolate
* Anne's note: Custard powder can be found in the baking section of
Canadian supermarkets. I have seen the substitution of instant vanilla
pudding or instant vanilla pudding powder in American cookbooks.

"Recipes for this no-bake treasure appear in countless cookbook as
Chocolate Fridge Cake, New York Slice, Miracle Bars, Ribbon Squares
and many other names. But the origin of Nanaimo Bars is still a hot
topic of debate. The Woman's Auxiliary to the Nanaimo Hospital Cook
Book (1952) included three similar recipes (two called Chocolate
Squares and one Chocolate Slice). These recipes appeared under the
name Nanaimo Bars in the Vancouver Sun in the early 50's and in the
B.C. Women's Institute Centennial of B.C. Cookbook in 1958. The test
kitchens of food companies developed various versions with their own
products. Since the 50s, endless variations include Minted, Grand
Marnier, Cherry, Pina Colada, Mocha, and Peanut Butter Nanaimo
Bars...During the 50s, a Dairy Food Service Bureau recipe called
Dominoes suggested piping a little bit of the middle layer into dots
on top to give a domino pattern when cut."

Bottom Layer: In double boiler, melt butter, sugar and cocoa; add egg
and cook until thickened. Add crumbs, nuts and coconut. Press into
ungreased 9 inch square pan.
Middle Layer: Beat together butter, cream, custard powder and sugar;
spread over base. Chill.
Top Layer: Melt chocolate with butter; cool slightly. Pour over
second layer; chill. Cut into bars.
