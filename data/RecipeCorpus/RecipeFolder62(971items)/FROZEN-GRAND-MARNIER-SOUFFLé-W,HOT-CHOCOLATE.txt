Title: FROZEN GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLé W/HOT CHOCOLATE
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 12 Servings
GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLÉ:
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Water
6    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Icing sugar
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1/2 c  Grand Marnier or other
-orange liqueur
3 c  Whipping cream
HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE:
8 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
-chocolate
1 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Grand Marnier
Combine the granulated sugar and water together in a heavy saucepan.
Cook, stirring until the mixture comes to a boil. Continue to cook,
without stirring, until the mixture reaches 240øF on a candy
thermometer (and is at the soft ball stage when a bit of the syrup is
dropped into a glass of cold water - about 5 to 7 minutes).

Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with the icing sugar until light and
fluffy (use a mixmaster or hand mixer for the best results).

Slowly drip the sugar syrup into the egg-yolk mixture, beating
constantly. Continue to beat the mixture until it is completely cool
and very light.

Stir in the vanilla and 1/2 cup Grand Marnier.

Whip the cream until it is light and forms soft peaks. Gently fold
into the Grand Marnier base.  Pour the mixture into a 10 inch
springform pan and cover with plastic wrap. Freeze immediately. When
frozen, wrap well if you are planning to keep it for longer than two
days.

To make the sauce, melt the chocolate and the cream in the top of a
double boiler.  Beat well until combined thoroughly.

Stir in 2 tbsp. Grand Marnier and serve hot.  (The sauce may be
prepared ahead, but it will solidify when refrigerated, so warm it
again before serving.)

Before serving, place the frozen soufflé (if frozen solid) in the
refrigerator for 30 minutes to make slicing easier. Run a knife
around the inside edge of the springform pan and then unsnap the pan.
Serve in wedges and pass the chocolate sauce separately.
