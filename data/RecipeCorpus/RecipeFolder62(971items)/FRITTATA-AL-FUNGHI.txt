1 lb Assorted mushrooms *
3 tb To 5 tb olive oil
3    Or 4 cloves garlic, chopped
Salt and pepper
2 tb Chopped parsley
1 ts Chopped fresh mint
1 c  Chopped, well flavored
-tomatoes **
6    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
* Include at least some specialty mushrooms, such as portobello or
crimini ** Pomi brand is excellent if fresh ones are not available

This mushroom frittata comes from Luca Citi of Cafe Citi in Kenwood.

Slice mushrooms and saute in a few tablespoons of olive oil, then
season with garlic, salt and pepper, parsley and mint. Add tomatoes
to the pan and cook down over high heat until there is nearly no
liquid left. Let cool.

Mix eggs with cheese, then add mushroom/tomato mixture. Heat
remaining oil in heavy, nonstick frying pan, then pour in
egg/cheese/mushroom mixture and cook slowly over medium low heat,
letting the egg cook on the bottom, lifting up the edges with a
spatula to let the runny egg move to the bottom and cook

When the mixture is partially set and the bottom has browned, either
invert the frittata onto a plate and then flip back into the pan,
cooking over medium heat until it too is browned and set, or place
under the broiler to broil until golden brown and cooked through.
Serve either hot or cool.

Serves 6 as a first course or lunch dish.
