MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 tb Butter
2 lb Apples, cored and diced
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 pn Nutmeg
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Lt brown sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 ts Vanilla
1 tb Cornstarch
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
3 c  Flour
2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
6 tb Shortening
1    Egg
3/4 c  Milk
Powdered sugar
Preheat oil for frying.  In a sauce pan, melt the butter. Add the
apples and saute for 2 minutes.  Stir in the cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/4
cup sugar, and brown sugar. Continue sauteing for 1 minute, stirring
constantly to dissolve the sugar.  Add the water and lemon juice.
Bring the liquid up to a boil.  Add cornstarch dissolved in 1
Tablespoon of water. Whisk the vanilla and slurry into the liquid.
Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 15 - 20 minutes, or until
the apples are soft. Remove from heat and cool completely.

In a mixing bowl, sift the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder,
together. Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, working
it to make a thick dough. Break the dough into 12 equal portions. On
a lightly floured surface, roll the dough pieces into thin rounds,
about 5 inches in diameter.  Put 1/4 cup of the mixture in the center
of each round, fold over and crimp the edges with a fork. Fry the
pies, two to three at a time, in the hot oil, until golden brown.
Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Powder the pies with
the powdered sugar. May serve

with vanilla ice cream. From The Essence of Emeril
