Title: FRESH TURNIP SALAD
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
1/4 ts Black pepper 1 1/2 c
3 tb Mayonnaise, or to taste 2 oz
Yield: 6 Servings  2 lb Turnips, peeled and shredded
Chopped celery
Chopped pimento, drained FOLLOWING ARE OPTIONAL 1/2 c Chopped ripe
olives, PLUS 1 ts Hot red pepper sauce More for garnish 1 ts Garlic
powder 1/4 ts Salt

In a large mixing bowl, combine turnips, celery, pimento, olives,
salt, black pepper and mayonnaise. Toss to mix well; taste and adjust
seasonings. Add pepper sauce and garlic powder, and toss to blend.
Best made a day ahead. NOTE: The original recipe does not call for
pepper sauce or garlic, and yields a light crisp salad without them.
But, if you prefer a bit more flavor, the pepper sauce and garlic
powder add zest without overpowering the delicious taste of the fresh
turnip.
