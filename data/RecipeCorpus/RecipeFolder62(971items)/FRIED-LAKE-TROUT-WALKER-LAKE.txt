Title: FRIED LAKE TROUT WALKER LAKE
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Laker or char
-Or several grayling
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper or lemon pepper
Cornmeal
-- enough for dredging
Shortening
-- enough for frying
2 tb Butter
1 c  Sour cream
1/2 ts Lemon juice
Clean and wash the fish and cut into serving pieces, leaving skin on.
Salt and pepper and coat thoroughly with cornmeal.

Directions: In a fry pan, bring 1/4 to 1/2 inch of shortening to high
heat, add fish, and fry for approximately 4 minutes; turn, and cook
for 3 minutes more. Fish should be nicely browned. Put cooked fish on
hot serving platter. Pour off fat from pan and replace with the
butter, add the sour cream, and stir with a spoon to loosen any
greables. Cook for several minutes, but do not boil. Remove from
heat, add lemon juice, stir, and pour over trout. Please note that
this recipe is easy enough that you could make it at home and while
camping in a car camp. (Backpacking with sour cream might be a little
difficult, though there are powder preparations available to emulate
sour cream.)
