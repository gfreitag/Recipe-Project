Title: FRICASE DE POLLO (CUBAN-STYLE CHICKEN FRICASS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2 c  Sour orange juice
Or mix sweet orange and lime
Juices
Half and half
4    Cloves garlic -- peeled and
Minced
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
4 lb Chicken pieces -- skinned
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
2 lg Onions -- peel, chop
1 lg Green bell pepper --
Chopped
1 c  Tomato sauce
1 c  Dry white wine
1/4 c  Capers
1/2 c  Stuffed green olives
1/2 c  Raisins
1 lb Potatoes -- peeled and

Combine the sour orange juice, garlic, salt and pepper in a container
suitable for marinating the chicken. Add the chicken pieces to the
marinade, cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Remove the chicken and
blot in on paper towels.  Reserve the marinade. Warm the oil in a
large Dutch oven over medium heat and brown the chicken pieces. Do
this in batches rather than overcrowd the pan. Then return all the
chicken to the pan. Add onions and green pepper, sauteing with the
chicken until onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add reserved
marinade, tomato sauce, wine, capers, olives, raisins, and potatoes.
Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer for 30 minutes. Transfer
chicken to a large serving dish and spoon the sauce over it.
