PREPARING PANS: *************** Before you start preparing batter,
prepare pans. Except when otherwise directed, line greased pans with
heavy brown paper, so edges don't get too brown or dry and cakes can
removed from pans easily; grease paper with shortening before pouring
in batter until batter almost fills the pan.

BAKING: ******* To help keep cake moist, place pan of water in oven
below cake. Place cake on middle rack of oven. Be sure heat can
circulate around each pan. Tester inserted in center of cake should
come out clean but may be sticky with fruit. If top of cake gets too
brown before it's done, lay foil loosely over top.

STORING: ******** Ripening is a mellowing process in which flavors
mingle. Ripening takes from 3 to 8 weeks; the more fruit, the longer
it takes. To speed it up, before baking, mix fruit and nuts with
spirit and let sit overnight. After baking, make skewer holes in cake
and pour in a small amount of heated brandy or other spirit. Wrap
cooled cakes in cheesecloth moistened with brandy, sherry, rum or
whisky. Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap, then foil. Place in
airtight tin and store in refrigerator or in cool, dark place,
moistening cheesecloth every 2 weeks, if necessary. After cake
ripens, it can be frozen for up to one year. Thaw in refrigerator for
24 hours.
