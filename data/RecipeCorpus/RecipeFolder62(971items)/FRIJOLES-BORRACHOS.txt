Title: FRIJOLES BORRACHOS
Categories: Beans, Tex-mex, Alcohol
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Pinto beans
6 c  ;water or more as needed
12 oz Beer
2 ts Bacon drippings or
Peanut oil
1 lg Onion; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
2    Fresh jalapenos or
1    To 2 serranos; chopped
2    Pickled jalapenos; chopped
1 ts Chili powder
1 ts Salt; optional
Pick through the beans and rinse them, watching for any gravel or
grit. Soak the beans in water, enough to cover them by several
inches, preferably overnight.

Drain the beans, and add them to a stockpot or a large, heavy
saucepan. Cover them with the water and beer. Simmer the beans,
uncovered, over low heat.

After 1 hour, stir the beans up from the bottom and check the liquid
level. If there is not at least an inch more water than beans, add
enough hot water to bring it to that level. Simmer the beans another
30 minutes, then check them again, adding water as needed.

When the beans are well softened, add the remaining ingredients, and
continue simmering.  Cook at least 15 more minutes, keeping the level
of the water just above the beans. The beans are done when they are
soft and creamy but not mushy, with each bean retaining its shape.
There should be extra liquid at the completion of the cooking time,
although the beans should not be soupy.  If you want the liquid a
little thicker, squash a few of the beans in the bottom of the pot
with a potato or bean masher.

Serve the beans immediately, or cover them and keep them warm for as
long as 1 hour.  Or let them cool, and refrigerate or freeze them for
later use.
