Title: FROZEN SWEET POTATO PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 5 Servings
1 lb Sweet potatoes; quartered
Salt
1 c  Sugar
1    Lime; zest only, in strips
1/2 c  Water
3    Eggs; separated
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Water
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
2 tb Dark rum OR md-sweet sherry
1/4 ts Mace, ground
1/8 ts Ginger, ground
2 ds Angostura bitters
1. Boil potatoes and pinch of salt in water to cover until very
tender, about 30 minutes. Drain; cool for easy handling and peel.

2. Combine 1 cup sugar, lime zest and 1/2 cup water in a heavy
saucepan. Heat to a boil over medium heat until sugar dissolves,
about 5 minutes. Cool; discard zest.

3. Put egg whites, sugar, 1 tablespoon water and cream of tartar in
top of double boiler over gently simmering water. Cook, whisking
constantly, until temperature reaches 160 degrees. Whisk vigorously
so the whites don't coagulate. (They will turn white and foamy; this
is ok.) Transfer to mixer bowl; set aside.

4. Combine sweet potatoes and cooled syrup in food processor. Pulse
until smooth. Pour mixture into top of double boiler over gently
simmering water. Stir in egg yolks, rum, mace, ginger and bitters.
Stir until mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Cool.

5. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold into
sweet potato mixture in thirds. Cover and freeze. To serve, remove
from the freezer and allow to soften slightly.
