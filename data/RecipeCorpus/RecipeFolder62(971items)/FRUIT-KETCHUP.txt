Title: FRUIT KETCHUP
Categories: Canning
Yield: 1 Servings
15 lg Tomatoes; skins removed
3    Apples; peeled/ cored
3    Pears; peeled/ cored
3    Peaches; skinned
3 c  White sugar
2 1/2 c  White vinegar
3    Onions; chopped
1 1/2 tb Pickling salt
1 lg Green pepper; chopped
1/2    Celery bunch; chopped
1 ts Pickling spice *
* Do not put in cheesecloth. Just sprinkle over ingredients. Simmer
approximately 2 hours or until thick. Yield Approximately 6-8 pint.

To Make a thicker ketchup, I used the following: 20 Tomatoes (instead
of 15); 4 Large Apples (instead of 3); 4 Pears (instead of 3); 5
Peaches (instead of 3); 3-1\4 Cups Sugar instead of 3 cups; Same
amount of vinegar as above; 4 Large onions (instead of 3); 2 tbsp
pickling salt; 3 Large peppers (instead of one)--I used 2 green and 1
red for variety; 3\4 Head of Celery; 1 tbsp of pickling spice.

If you prefer a firmer fruit, you would add celery, peppers, onions,
sugar, vinegar and spices and cook slightly longer before adding
fruit--especially if fruit is very ripe. Simmer at least 2 hours
until thick: Yield: 7 QuartsJM.

LAST SEASON I MADE ALMOST 20 QUARTS OF THIS--WE JUST LOVE IT. Sherilyn
Palmer. Although the second part of this recipe is my own variation,
this recipe is truly an authentic French Canadian pickle made in most
parts of Quebec, Canada. Therefore, most French Canadian cooks will
have a slightly different version of this recipe. From Sherilyn
