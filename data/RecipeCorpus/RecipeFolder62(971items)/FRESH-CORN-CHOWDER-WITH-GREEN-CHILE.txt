4 tb Margarine
1 1/2 c  Chopped green chile

4 md Potatoes, peeled, cut

You can puree two cups of corn in the blender if corn is mature. If
sweet and tender use as is. Saute onions in margarine, stir in the
corn, potatoes and stock and bring to a boil. Simmer until potatoes
are soft. Add the chile and cream (the recipe doesn't say but I
always roast and peel my chiles before using). Salt and pepper to
taste. Let simmer to desired thickness. WALT
