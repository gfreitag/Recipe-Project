2 c  Boiling water
1 1/2 c  Halved walnuts
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Vegetable oil
Pour boiling water over nuts and let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Drain well.
Transfer to baking sheet. Sprinkle with sugar and mix well. Spread in
single layer and let stand overnight to dry.

Heat oil in wok or skillet until very hot. Add nuts in small batches
and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; watch carefully because
they can burn quickly. Drain on rack. Store in tightly covered
