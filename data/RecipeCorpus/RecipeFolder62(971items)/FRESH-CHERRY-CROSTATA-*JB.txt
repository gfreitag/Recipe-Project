Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  + 1 T all-purpose flour
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2    Sticks (6 oz) cold unsalted
-butter, cut into 1/4" dice
-plus 1 T melted butter
1/2 c  Ice water
2 tb Blanched almonds, very
--finely chopped
3 lb Fresh cherries, pitted
In a bowl, mix 2 cups of the flour with 1 tablespoon of the sugar and
the salt.  Add the cold butter and cut it in briefly using a pastry
blender. Add the water and stir just until the dough begins to come
together.

Gather up the dough and transfer it to a lightly floured surface.
Knead briefly until it forms a smooth, cohesive mass. Pat the dough
into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour
before rolling out.

Mix the almonds with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour and 1
tablespoon of the sugar.

Preheat the oven to 400F.  On a lighlty floured surface, roll out the
dough to a 15-inch round; transfer to a baking sheet. Sprinkle the
almond mixture all over the dough to within 1 1/2 inches of the edge.
Arrange the cherries on top.  Fold the edge of the dough up and over
the fruit.

Brush the melted butter over the pastry border and sprinkle the
remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over the whole crostata. Bake for 50
minutes to 1 hour, or until the crostata is deeply browned. Let cool
on a rack for 10 minutes. Dip a brush into the crostata and glaze the
cherries with some of their juices. Serve warm.
