Title: FRIED EGGPLANT SANDWICHES
Categories: Sandwiches, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Eggplant
Salt
6 oz Mozzarella cheese
(not grated)
1/2 ts Yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water
(105-115 degrees)
2 c  Plain flour
Pepper to taste
4 1/2 tb Oil
1 lg Egg white
Oil for frying
Slice the eggplant into 1/4" rounds.  Sprinkle with salt and let
drain in a colandar for about an hour. Slice the mozzarella into thin
slices and trim to the shape of the eggplant slices. Sprinkle the
yeast over the warm water abd stir until is dissolved. Whisk in 1 1/2
cups flour and the pepper until smooth. Keep at room temp for 30 min.
Rinse and pat dry the eggplant slices.  Fry them in batches using 1 T
oil per batch over medium heat about 2 min per side. Remove to paper
towels to drain while you finish the other slices. Place a cheese
slice between each two eggplant slices (like a sandwich). Press
firmly together and dip in the remaining flour to coat both sides.
Beat the egg white until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. Fold into
the yeast mixture. Heat oil (about 1 inch deep) in a large frying
pan. Dip 1 eggplant sandwich into the batter at a time and place in
the hot oil. Fry 4-6 at a time for 1-2 minutes per side until light
brown. Place on paper towels to drain oil until all are done. Serve
hot. These are great with a horseradish type dressing on top!
Depending on the size of the eggplant, this could make 6-12
sandwiches. Walt MM
