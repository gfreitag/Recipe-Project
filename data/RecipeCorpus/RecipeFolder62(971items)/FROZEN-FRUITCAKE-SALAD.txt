Categories: Salads, Desserts, Fruits, Holiday
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Sour cream
2 oz Cool whip; thawed
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Vanilla
13 oz Crushed pineapple; drain
2    Bananas; diced
1/2 c  Red Candied cherries; chop
1/2 c  Grees Candied cherries; chop
1/2 c  Nuts; (pecans or walnuts)
Mix all together well, turn into a mold and freeze. Let stand 10
minutes before serving. Everyone loves this. It's good for dessert
too. It's especially pretty at Christmas because of the red and green
cherries but we like it for Thanksgiving too.
