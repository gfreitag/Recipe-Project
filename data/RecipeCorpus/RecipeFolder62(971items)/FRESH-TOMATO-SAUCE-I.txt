Hill and Barclay write: "This tomato sauce, made without the usual
paste, is wonderful to keep on hand in the freezer for pasta,
omelets, and grilled meats and poultry."

Heat olive oil in large skillet over moderately high heat; saute
onion and garlic until softened.  Add tomatoes gradually, keeping
heat as high as possible without browning. Stir in herbs, wine and
any reserved tomato juice; reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20
minutes, or until vegetables are softened and fragrant. Add more wine
or water if needed, to prevent sticking and maintain desired
consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Yield: About 3 cups.
