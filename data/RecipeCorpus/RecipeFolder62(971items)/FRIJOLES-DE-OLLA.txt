Title: FRIJOLES DE OLLA
Categories: Mexican, Side dish
Yield: 4 Cups
1/2 lb Dry beans, such as pinto,
-California pink or black
-turtle
Salt
1/4    White onion, roughly sliced
1 tb Lard (heaping tablespoon)
Run beans through hands to pick out any small stones or pieces of
earth. Rinse twice in cold water and drain. Put beans into pot and
cover with enough hot water to come at least 3" above beans.

Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, onion and lard. Bring to simmer. Continue
simmering until skins of beans are soft. Season to taste with salt.
Continue cooking until beans are very soft and broth is soupy. Beans
are better eaten day after cooking, when flavor matures. Makes about
3 1/2 cups.
