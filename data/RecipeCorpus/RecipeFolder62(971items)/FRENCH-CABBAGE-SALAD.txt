Title: FRENCH CABBAGE SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Cabbage, shredded
1/4 lb Bacon
2 c  Onion, chopped
1    Garlic clove, chopped
1/2 c  White-wine tarragon
-vinegar
Cut the bacon into tiny bits, fry it in a big deep frying pan, and
fish out all the bits after they are crisp. Cut up the onion and
garlic and fry them in the bacon fat. When they are brown, pour in
the vinegar.

Bring it just up to a simmer, add all the cabbage and bacon, toss it
as you would a salad, and serve it. The cabbage doesn't cook, but it
wilts a little under the hot vinegar.

NOTES:

*  Wilted cabbage salad with bacon -- This is a wonderful thing to do
with cabbage.  With no garlic, and using cider vinegar, it becomes
German cabbage salad. Adding sour cream to that makes Danish cabbage
salad.

*  Cut the vinegar with a little water if you don't like very sour
things,
