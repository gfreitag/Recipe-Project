Title: FRENCH BREAD II BY DAK
Categories: Dak, Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
-SHARON WERTZ   (SBVD40A)
2 1/2 ts Yeast
2 c  Bread flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Butter
1 c  Plus 1 T warm water
Put all ingredients into the pan in the order listed. If your machine
has a french bread cycle, use it, otherwise use white bread. I don't
recommend the turbo (2 1/2 hour single rise) cycle for this bread -
It is worth waiting 4 hours for!
