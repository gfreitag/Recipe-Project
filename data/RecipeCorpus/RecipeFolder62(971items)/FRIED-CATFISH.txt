Title: FRIED CATFISH
Categories: Main dishes, Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
Peanut oil or vegetable
Cooking oil
Louisiana hot sauce
Catfish filets -- 2-3"
Pieces
Salt -- to taste
Corn flour or fish fry
Heat oil on high heat to about 375 . Wash the filets and pat dry with
a paper towel. Place in a tray, splashing well with liquid hot sauce,
sprinkle with salt. Roll the fish to spread the seasoning evenly.
Drop the filets into a tray of corn flour or fish fry, battering them
evenly, so that they are completely covered in corn flour. Test the
oil's temperature. If hot enough, remove filets from corn flour,
shake off excess flour and gently drop filets into oil. Cook until
golden. Remove from the oil, drain for a minute, then serve.
Festival: Louisiana Catfish Festival; July 8-9, 1995.
