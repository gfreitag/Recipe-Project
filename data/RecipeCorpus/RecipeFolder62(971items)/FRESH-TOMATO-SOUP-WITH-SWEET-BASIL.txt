Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1 md Onion
2 tb Unsalted butter
12    Red, ripe tomatoes,
-preferably plum
1 sm Clove garlic
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
1 c  Heavy cream
1 bn Fresh sweet basil
1/4 c  Sour cream, if serving cold
Slice onion.  Melt butter in a large heavy pot and saute slices until
they just begin to brown.  Quarter tomatoes and add them to the pot.

Crush entire clove of garlic by giving it a good whack with the flat
of a cleaver, loosening cloves and slightly cracking skins. Add
garlic skins and all to pot. Add enough water to come to 1 inch above
level of tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper.  Add cream. Bring
soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook partially covered
20-25 minutes. In a blender or food processor, puree soup, then
strain,pushing through as much pulp as possible to obtain a smooth
thick cream.

To serve hot ladle soup into six warm bowls and garnish with fine
julienned basil leaves.

To serve cold allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at
least 2 hours, then add seasoning. It will require more salt and
pepper then when serves hot. Garnish with finely julienned basil
leaves. Top with a dollop of sour cream.
