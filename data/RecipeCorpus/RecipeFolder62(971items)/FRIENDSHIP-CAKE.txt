Title: FRIENDSHIP CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Amish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Peaches
1 c  Pineapple
1 c  Marachino cherries
1 pk Yeast
3 c  Sugar
For the fermented fruit started take:

Mix these all together and stir daily.  Let set for 2 weeks. I
usually use a  one gallon glass jug. Every second week add 1 c. sugar
and 1 c. of fruit.

For the cake portion mix: 1 box yellow cake mix 1 box instant pudding
1/2 c. oil 4 eggs 2 c. fruit 1 c. nuts

Mix and bake in a 350 degree over for one hour.  I usually use my
bundt pan.

Glaze 1 c. confectioner's sugar 1/3 c. lemon juice

I don't always glaze the cake and sometime add some of the juice to
the cake mix just to make it really moist and more flavorful.
