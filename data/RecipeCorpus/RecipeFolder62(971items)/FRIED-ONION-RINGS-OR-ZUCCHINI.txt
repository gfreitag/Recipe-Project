Title: FRIED ONION RINGS OR ZUCCHINI
Categories: Vegetables, American
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Self-rising flour
2/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 3/4 c  Milk
1    Egg, beaten
6 lg Onions, 1/4" rings or
6    Zucchini, 1/2" slices
Vegetable oil
Combine first 4 ingred in a large bowl; beat in milk and egg. Let
stand 5 min. Add onion or zucchini slices to batter in batches and
toss with hands until vegetables are well coated. When you are ready
to fry them, pick up vegetables, allowing excess batter to slide back
into bowl. Place slices immediately in hot oil (375 degrees), and
deep-fry until browned, turning once. Drain in a colander, and
sprinkle with additional salt, if desired.

Note:  Don't drain on paper towels; the fried food will get soggy.
Also, try not to stack them tightly. Air needs to circulate around
fried food so it will remain crisp.
