Recipe by: Sylvia Woods Preparation Time: 1:00 1) Trim the excess fat
from the edges of the pork chops. Sprinkle them generously with salt
and pepper.

2)  Season the flour generously with salt and pepper. Dredge the pork
chop in flour until coated on all sides. Shake off any excess flour.
Pour enough vegetable oil into a heavy deep skillet (cast-iron is
perfect) to fill it to 1 inch.  Heat over medium heat to 375oF. (A
small cube of bread dropped in the oil will brown in about 30
seconds.)

3)  Add only as many of the pork chops to the skillet as will fit
without touching.  Cook  them, turning them once, until cooked
through (no trace of pink remaining in the center) and deep golden
brown, about 12 minutes. Use a long-handled fork or tongs to prevent
getting splattered.

4)  Remove the pork chops from the skillet to drain. Sprinkle them
with paprika and serve hot.
