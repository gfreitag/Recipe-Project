In a large bowl combine beef chunks, wine, bay leaf, cloves, onion and
garlic. Toss together to coat meat, cover bowl with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for 4 -
12    hours.

In a large heavy pot, melt butter and cook off bacon until just
crispy and set aside to drain. Scoop beef from marinade and pat dry
with paper towels. Toss in a bowl with flour to coat. Shake off
excess flour. Add the floured beef to the pot and cook until nicely
browned. Stir in the onion and garlic from the marinade, as well as
the thyme, stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until meat is tender.

Peel the pearl onions and trim off a little bit of the root end. Melt
butter in a small skillet and add pearl onions. Toss to coat and pour
in 1/4 cup of water and cover. Simmer until tender. Uncover and allow
liquid to evaporate. Sprinkle in 1 teaspoon sugar and shake pan over
medium heat until onions begin to brown and caramelize. Season with
salt & pepper.

In another skillet melt 3 tablespoons butter and cook mushrooms until
golden brown. Stir in crispy bacon bits and season with salt & pepper.

When the beef is tender, remove meat with a slotted spoon to a bowl.
Simmer sauce until thickened and stir in flour/butter mixture to help
thicken. Season sauce to taste. Return beef to pot and bring stew to
a boil. Serve hot with boiled potatoes, pearl onions, mushrooms and
garnish with chopped parsley.
