1 heavy omelet pan, 10 inches across the top and 7 inches across
bottom, with low, sloping sides and a non-stick bottom

Beat eggs for 20-30 seconds at most. Place butter in a hot pan.
Butter is ready when foam starts to subside and maybe starts to brown
a little.

Pour in the eggs. Let set for 2-3 seconds then cook for 20-30 seconds
until just golden, tilting pan and rolling egg toward opposite side
of pan, using a spatula to help push it and keep it together. Keep
the pan tilted at a slight angle, away from you, gradually flipping
the pan so that the omelet flips over onto itself.

Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve, brushing with garlic, chive
or red pepper butter and fresh herbs for garnish.

FRENCH OMELET VARIATION: After eggs set for 2-3 seconds, sprinkle
Gruyere cheese across raw middle.

DUCK FAT VARIATION: Use 2 tablespoons of duck fat in place of the
butter.

Suggested wine: A light, crisp young white wine such as a Muscat from
the Alsace region--perhaps one from Dirler.
