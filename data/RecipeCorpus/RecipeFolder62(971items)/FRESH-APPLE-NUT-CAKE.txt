1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon

Peel apples.  Chop apples and pecans.  Mix dry ingredients in a bowl
and then push to the sides to form a hole in the center. Add liquid
ingredients and mix in. The mixture will become thick and will need
to be mixed with hands.  Add apples and nuts.  Bake at 350 degrees
for 1 hour. For best results bake in a bundt pan. Randy Rigg
