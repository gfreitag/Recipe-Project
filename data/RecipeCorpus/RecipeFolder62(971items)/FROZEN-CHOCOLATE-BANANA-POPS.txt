Title: FROZEN CHOCOLATE BANANA POPS
Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 12 Servings
6    Firm ripe bananas
12 oz Semisweet chocolate pieces
6 tb Oil
Colored sprinkles OR
- grated coconut OR
- coarsely ground nuts
Cut peeled bananas in halves crosswise. Impale each half on wooden
skewer and place in freezer 1 hour or until frozen. (Coatings will
run off if fruit is at room temperature.) Melt chocolate in top of
double boiler over hot, not boiling, water. Add oil and stir until
smooth. Keep warm over hot water while dipping. Remove bananas from
freezer a few at a time. Dip and roll bananas in melted chocolate,
making sure all banana surfaces are completely covered. Gently shake
or twirl banana before removing from pan to remove excess coating.
While chocolate is still soft, roll covered banana in colored
sprinkles, coconut or nuts. If coating becomes too hard to hold
decorations, apply a little warm coating to pop. When covering sets,
place pops on squares of foil, wrap securely and store in freezer
until ready to eat.
