Categories: Cakes
Yield: 10 Servings
4 md Oranges
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Soft shortening
1 c  Sugar
2 1/4 c  Sifted cake flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
2 lg Egg whites
Orange Cream Icing,
Recipe follows
Heat oven to 350'F. Grease and flour 2 8-inch round layer cake pans.
Grate the rind from two of the oranges, then peel these and one other
orange, removing all of the white next to the pulp. Discard the peel.
Section these oranges, discarding membranes and seeds. Cut the
sections into very small pieces. Squeeze the remaining orange and add
the juice to the cut-up fruit sections. Measure out 1 1/4 cups of
this mixture and add 1/2 cup sugar to it. Stir until the sugar
dissolves. Take out 1/4 cup and reserve for the icing. Cream sugar
well, add 1 cup sugar gradually and cream well after each addition.
Sift flour, baking powder, soda and salt together and add to creamed
mixture alternately with the orange-sugar mixture. Stir in one
tablespoon of the grated orange rind. Beat egg whites until stiff but
not dry and fold in. Turn into prepared pans and bake about 25
minutes or until tops spring back when touched lightly in the center.
Turn out on racks and cool. Fill and ice with Orange Cream Icing and
sprinkle top with remaining grated orange rind.
