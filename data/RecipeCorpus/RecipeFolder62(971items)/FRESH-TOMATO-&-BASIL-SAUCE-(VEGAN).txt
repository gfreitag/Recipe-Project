We like to make this delicately spiced sauce in the summer when
fresh, ripe tomatoes are sweet and plentiful. And the addition of
fresh basil definitely adds a gourmet touch Place chopped tomatoes in
a colander or strainer for 30 min to drain. Press down with a spoon
several times to squeeze out excess liquid. In a medium sauce pan
over medium heat add onions, garlic and cook until onions are tender
adding a bit of water to prevent sticking about 5-10 min. Add
tomatoes, basil, sugar salt and pepper to saucepan and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered 1 hour. Stir in tomato
paste and continue to cook 10 more min. Serve over your favorite
shape of pasta. Nutrition (per serving): 82 calories Total Fat 1 g
