1. Cut fruit into bite-sized pieces. If using pomelo, peel indi-
vidual sections and break apart into grains about the size of a grape
seed. if grapes contain seeds, split and seed them. Toss apple or
pear slices in a little citrus juice to keep them from oxidizing.

2. In a small skillet or saucepan, heat oil over low heat and gently
fry shallot and garlic until lightly browned. Remove and drain on
paper towels.

3. In a medium bowl, combine lime juice, salt, and sugar (if used)
and stir to dissolve. Add fruits, shrimp, and half the garlic and
shallot and toss to coat evenly with dressing. Taste and adjust
seasoning if necessary. Transfer to serving dish and garnish with
remaining garlic and shallot, peanuts, and chile.

Serves 4 with other dishes.

Variation: Use cooked and shredded chicken or pork in place of shrimp.
