Title: FRENCH BREAKFAST PUFFS
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 6 Servings
1/3 c  Sweet butter, cubed
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 lb Melted butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg.

Use Food Processor.  Insert steel blade, add butter, and sugar using
the on/off method cream together, add egg and mix well.

Feed alternately through the tube the dry ingredients and milk. Be
sure that the milk is the last ingredient to be added. Fill greased
muffin tin 2/3 full. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, bake 20-25 minutes,
until golden brown.  Remove from muffin tin and roll in melted
butter, then in mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon.

Do not roll the puffs you do not plan to use immediately. These can be
frozen or refrigerated and when reheated roll in the butter and sugar
mixture. The puffs will get hard and crusty if rolled in the butter
then reheated.  Serve hot.

"Sinfully delicious.  We serve these with homemade butter and coffee
to our guests."  Linda Hughes, Sanger Tx
