Title: FRIED CHICKEN & PAN GRAVY
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
Text
Put a cup of flour seasoned with salt and pepper in a large, brown
grocery bag.  Then put the chicken pieces in a few at a time and
shake vigorously to coat them well. Fry 'em uncovered in about a
quarter inch oil for 45 minutes or so.  Drain the excess oil, leaving
about three tablespoons and brown an equal amount of flour in the
oil, then gradually whisk in a cup or so of milk. Viola! Fried
Chicken and Pan Gravy. This was how my grandmother made fried chicken
and it was indisputably the BEST in the world! I do it exactly as she
did, but still can't get it that good... This should make a nice,
crispy batch of chicken. If you cover while frying, it will probably
come out soggy.
