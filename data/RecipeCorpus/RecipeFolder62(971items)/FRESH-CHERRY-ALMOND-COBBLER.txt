Combine cherries, 1/2 cup sugar, lemon juice, arrowroot, almond
extract, grated lemon zest and cinnamon together in a sauce pan and
cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until mixture simmers,
about 4 - 5 minutes. Pour into a lightly buttered 2 quart baking dish.

In a food processor or mixer, add flour, remaining sugar, baking
powder and salt and pulse 2 or 3 times to mix. Add butter and pulse
until just combined but still crumbly. Add cream, egg, vanilla and
pulse again just to combine and form a smooth batter.

Drop batter by heaping teaspoons on top of cherry mixture, leaving
space in between. Sprinkle almonds over and bake in a preheated 400
degree oven for 20 minutes or until top is lightly browned and cherry
mixture is bubbling. Serve warm or at room temperature with Vanilla
Bean Ice Cream or slightly sweetened whipped cream.

Yield: 5-6 servings
