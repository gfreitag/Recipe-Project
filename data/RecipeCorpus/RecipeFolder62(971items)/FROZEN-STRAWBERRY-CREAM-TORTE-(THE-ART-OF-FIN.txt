Title: FROZEN STRAWBERRY CREAM TORTE (THE ART OF FIN
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Swiss Meringue recipe
2 1/2 c  Heavy cream **
1/2 c  Almonds, blanched & sliced
1 c  Strawberry,sliced sweetened
** Cream is whipped, unsweetened, gelatin added, flavored with rum.
See Whipped Cream recipe.

Set oven at 250 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 large baking sheets.
Trace 4 circles in flour, each 6 inches in diameter. Spread thin
layer of Swiss Meringue within each circle.  Sprinkle 1 layer with
sliced almonds. Bake meringue layers in a 200 degree oven 30-40
minutes, or as slowly as possible, until they are completely crisp
and dry, but still white.

Combine about 2 1/3 cups of whipped cream with sweetened berries that
have first been well drained, folding carefully together. Working as
quickly as possible to prevent meringue from softening, sandwich
layers with whipped cream mixture.  Place the almond-studded layer on
top. Place in the freezer for 2-3 hours, or until cake is frozen.

Spread most of remaining whipped cream around sides. With a star
tube, make a border of rosettes around top of torte with the last of
the whipped cream.  Place again in freezer. When sides and border are
frozen, the torte can be wrapped for freezer storage and kept up to 6
weeks. Serve frozen.
