Title: FRESH SPINACH PRESTO SAUCE
Categories: Cookbook by, Sauces
1 c  yellow onion -- chopped
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  olive oil -- divided
3    cloves garlic -- minced
3 c  fresh spinach leaves --
packed
:
2 ts dried basil
1/2 ts salt
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese -- grated

Saute the onion and garlic in about 4 tablespoons of the olive oil
until onion is soft and transparent; remove from heat and cool
slightly. Spoon the onion and oil mixture into a blender or food
processor. Add spinach, basil and salt. Process until mixture is
finely chopped. With motor running, pour the remaining 1/4 cup of
olive oil in a slow but steady stream through the feeder hole. Blend
to a coarse puree, then stop the motor, add cheese and process for
just a moment more. Yields 1-1/4 cups sauce.

She developed this sauce to use on fettuccini because her family
doesn't like classic pesto. "...I found myself dipping into it
serendipitously throughout the week. One night I placed dollops of it
atop of our grilled chicken breasts. Another time it became the basis
for a quick pasta salad. It even worked as a sandwich spread with
sun-dried tomatoes, Swiss cheese, and pickled Greek pepperoncini. Try
it as an accent for pork chops or fish filets too.

"This is a delectable, speedy, make-ahead sauce. Refrigerated, it
maintains good color and flavor for at least a week. It could
probably go longer, but I haven't managed to leave a batch alone long
enough to be sure." Source: Oregon food writer and artist: Jan
