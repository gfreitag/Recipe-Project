Title: FRESH ASPARAGUS WITH LEMON BUTTER SAUCE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Asparagus, Fresh
1/4 lb Butter
3 tb Lemon Juice, Concentrate
1 tb Parsley, Chopped
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Tabasco Sauce
Select fresh asparagus for crispness and young tender pencil sized
stalks are ideal. Wash asparagus under cold running water. Snap off
the lower end of each stalk with your fingers. Let the stalk break
where it wants to. This will leave only the tender portion of the
asparagus. Young tender stalks can be cooked in a steamer for 5-7
minutes, the more mature stalks for 7-10 minutes. DO NOT OVERCOOK
asparagus. It will lose flavor and nutrients if overcooked. Prior to
cooking the asparagus, prepare the lemon butter sauce. This is enough
sauce for 1 to 1-1/2 pounds of asparagus. Combine the butter, lemon
juice, parsley, salt and Tabasco Sauce in a small saucepan and heat
until hot. DO NOT BOIL. Pour the heated sauce over the cooked
asparagus and serve. From: Syd's Cookbook.
