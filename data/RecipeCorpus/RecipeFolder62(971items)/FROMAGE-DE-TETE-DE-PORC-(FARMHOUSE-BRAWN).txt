Have the butcher split the head into halves and remove the ears.
Place cut side down in a sieve and pour fast-boiling water over the
skin. Drain and scrape off any blemishes. Peel and finely chop the
shallots. Peel the carrots and onions and trim the leek, cut them all
into pieces. Place the pig's head, car- rots, onions, leek and peeled
garlic in a large pan, cover generously with cold water and bring
slowly to boiling point over low heat. Skim off the froth that rises
and when clear add the herbs tied together, seasoning and cloves.
Cover and cook, sim- mering steadily, for 2 hours or until the meat
detaches itself from the bones. Remove the meat, skin and fat from
the bones, Cut into pieces and place in a large bowl. Add the brains,
and the tongue skinned and cut into small pieces. Mash with a fork
and mix well. Test for seasoning, add black pepper if necessary so
that the mixture is well flavoured. Mix in the chopped shallot and
parsley, and stir to incorporate thoroughly. Pour into 2 wetted
moulds and when cold refrigerate until required.

To serve, cut into slices and arrange on a large serving dish
surrounded by lettuce leaves. Hand French mustard separately and a
mixed green salad tossed in vinaigrette dressing.

Being made of fresh meat this brawn should be eaten within a week.
