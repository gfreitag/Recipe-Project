Categories: Salads/dres, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
1    Bag minature marshmallows
1 cn Crushed pineapple with juice
1    Glass Kraft pimento cheese
2 pk Dream Whip or 1 8c Cool whip
Thawed
Place marshmallows, pimento cheese, and crushed pineapple with juice
in large bowl. Leave standing for several hours, stirring once in a
while, until the cheese is soft and the marshmallows absorb the juice
of the pineapple.

Then whip both packages of Dream whip according to directions on
package, or just use thawed Cool Whip right out of the container.
Fold whipped topping into pimento cheese, pineapple, and marshmallow
mixture. (Do not beat or stir.) Turn into 13 X 9 X 2 inch pan, cover
with aluminum foil, and freeze. May be made the day before needed.
Keeps well when frozen.

To serve, cut into squares, and allow to thaw a little. Serve.

We prefer it frozen.
