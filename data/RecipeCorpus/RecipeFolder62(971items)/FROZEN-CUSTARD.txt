Title: FROZEN CUSTARD
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Milk
2 tb Flour
1 c  Sugar
1 ds Salt
1 tb Butter
2    Eggs
1 cn Milk, condensed
2 ts Vanilla
Combine milk, flour, sugar, salt, and butter, and cook until slightly
thickened.  Beat eggs and add slowly to hot custard, beating briskly.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly for a few more minutes.
Remove from heat and add condensed milk and vanilla.  Stir well.

NOTE [from the contributor]:  This is just the right amount for my
half-gallon freezer.  This was my mother's recipe, and she used to
call it "Daisy's low-cal custard." The nice thing about it is that
you usually have all the ingredients on hand. Of course, you can add
fresh fruits if you like, but I usually make it plain and let people
use whatever topping they choose.

This recipe is from "The National Recovery Act All-Dessert Cookbook"
put out by Radio 85, KOA, in Denver. The book is a collection of
recipes from listeners, I suppose, of this powerful station.  This
one is from Marcia Wilcoxon of Albion, NE.
