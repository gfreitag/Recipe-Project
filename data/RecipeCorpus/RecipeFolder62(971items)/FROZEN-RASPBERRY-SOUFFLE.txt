MMMMM-------------------------TO GARNISH------------------------------
Sweetened whipped cream
Fresh raspberries
*Note: Fresh raspberries are suggested for the puree, but unsweetened
frozen berries may be used if fresh are not available. Prepare a
3-quart souffle dish or mold with oiled aluminum foil collar
extending about 4 inches above rim.  Tie or tape securely. In large
bowl, beat yolks until thick and lemon colored.  Add 1 1/4 cups sugar
and beat until dissolved. Blend in raspberries. Transfer to double
boiler, place over hot water and cook until custard coats metal
spoon; do not allow to boil at any time. Strain into large metal bowl
set over ice and stir until cool. Add framboise a little at a time,
blending thoroughly after each addition. Fold whipped cream into
mixture. Pour into prepared dish, smooth top with spatula and freeze
overnight. When firm, cover top with plastic wrap or foil. Just
before serving, remove foil collar and smooth sides with spatula.
Garnish with whipped cream and fresh raspberries and accompany with
cooled sabayon or creme fraiche. This melts quickly so serve directly
from freezer. "The Argyle", San Antonio, Texas. Favorite Restaurant
