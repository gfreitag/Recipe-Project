Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Prunes
1 lb Figs
1 lb Dates
1/4 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Dried currants
1 tb Chopped candied citron
1 tb Chopped candied lemon peel

Soak prunes and figs 1 hour in just enough water to cover. Add dates
and cook gently in the same water for 20 minutes. Remove fruit, chop
and mix with other fruits and nuts. Reduce liquid to 3/4 cup. Cool to
lukewarm, add yeast and stir until well blended.  Add 2 cups flour,
beating well. Let rise until light and spongy. Add spices, salt,
fruit mixture and remaining flour to make a stiff dough.  Knead until
smooth.  Let rise until doubled in bulk.  Shape into oval loaves,
brush with slightly sweetened milk and sprinkle with split almonds.
Let rise again and bake in a 425 degree oven for 45 minutes.  Makes 3
loaves.  If desired, when cool, spread with icing and garnish with
candied fruits and nut meats.
