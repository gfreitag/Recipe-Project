Title: FRIED CHICKEN ROMAN STYLE (FROM ENGLAND)
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 lb Chicken cut into 6 serving
Pieces
2 tb Olive oil
2 oz Butter
Freshly ground black pepper
2 oz Parma ham or smoked ham in
One piece, finely diced
2 cl Garlic, finely crushed
4    Sage leaves, crumbled
4 oz Dry white wine (Frascati?)
4 oz Dry marsala
1 cn (14 oz) tomatoes, chopped
1 oz Tomato puree
Method ====== Heat the oil and butter in a wide, deep frying pan and
briskly fry the chicken pieces, turning often, until golden brown all
over. Pour off half the fat and add the pepper, the ham, garlic and
sage leaves. Saute for a couple of minutes. Pour in the white wine
and the marsala, bring to the boil and bubble gently for about a
minute, then lower the heat and continue cooking over a medium heat
until the wine has evaporated. Add the tomatoes to the pan with the
tomato puree and stir well to blend in all the crispy bits and pan
juices. Check seasoning - with the Parma ham you should not need salt
~ and continue cooking for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally
to prevent burning, until the sauce has reduced by half. It should be
thick and dark but not too plentiful. Transfer the chicken to a
warmed earthenware serving dish and serve with a simple green
vegetable or salad of mixed green leaves dressed with virgin olive
oil and lemon juice. John Burden 2:\255/1
