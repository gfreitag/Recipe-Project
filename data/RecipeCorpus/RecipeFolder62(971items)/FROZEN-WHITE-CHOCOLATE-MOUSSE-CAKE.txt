Melt 6 oz. white chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering

Continue boiling without stirring until candy thermometer registers

bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually beat hot syrup into whites.
Continue beating until mixture is stiff and glossy and bottom of bowl

Refrigerate chocolate mixture until cool but not set, about 5
minutes. Whip cream, Grand Marnier and vanilla in another large bowl
until soft peaks form. Gently fold cream into chocolate mixture. Fold
in chopped white chocolate.  Pour mixture into crust; smooth top with
spatula. Sprinkle top with chopped pistachios. Freeze until firm,
about 6 hours. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead; cover with plastic.)
Remove pan sides.

Cut dessert into wedges.  Serve with raspberry sauce. For raspberry
sauce: Puree raspberries in food processor or blender. Strain into
medium bowl to remove seeds.  Stir in sugar and Grand Marnier.
Refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 3
days ahead; cover). (From Bon Appetit, May 1990)
