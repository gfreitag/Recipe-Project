Using knife blade, coarsely chop pork and scallions in food
processor, using short bursts. Add ginger, egg yolk, soy sauce,
sesame oil, dry sherry and lemon pepper. Process a few short bursts
to mix. Set this pork mixture on plate. Rinse and dry processor bowl
and blade.
Place flour and MSG in processor bowl. Using knife blade, process
continuously while adding water all at once. Let processor run until
a ball of dough forms in the bowl, or 20 seconds, whichever comes
first. Remove dough and knead until elastic. Using half of dough,
roll out on lightly floured board to 1/16-inch thick. Cut into 2-inch
circles using biscuit cutter.
Place a rounded teaspoon of pork mixture in center of each dough
circle. Fold circle over filling, creating a "half moon" turnover.
Press edges together lightly with fingers. Place filled dumplings on
oiled plate.
In 3-quart saucepan bring 2 quarts of water to boil. Drop dumplings
in boiling water. Allow to boil one minute AFTER the dumpling returns
to surface of water. Drain well; replace dump- lings on oiled plate
to cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat 1/2 cup cooking oil in skillet over
medium to medium-high heat. Add dumplings; fry, turning often, until
lightly brown. Drain on paper towels.
Process garlic sauce ingredients using knife blade until smooth.
Serve hot dumplings with garlic sauce. May also be served with
Chinese mustard and/or hoisin sauce.
