Title: FRIED GREEN TOMATOES 28 JULY 1994
Categories: Side dishes, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Wholewheat flour
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 pn Black pepper
1 pn Cayenne
5 lg Green tomatoes, sliced 1/2"
-- thick
2 tb Canola oil
Combine the first five ingredients in a medium-sized bowl.

Dredge both sides of the tomato slices with the flour mixture.
Preheat the oven to 275F.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry the tomato
slices in a single layer until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
Cover and place in the oven to keep warm while cooking the other
slices. Repeat the process until all slices are cooked, adding oil as
needed. Serve hot.

MARK'S NOTE: At 595 mg there does seem to be an excessive amount of
sodium in this recipe.  I don't know if green tomatoes require more
salt than red ones, but those watching sodium intake may wish to
avoid this recipe.
