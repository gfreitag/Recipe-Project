The best way to capture the elusive flavore of summertime. Ben and
Jerry prefer small peaches because they have more flavor and less
water than the larger ones. 1. Combine the peaches, 1/2 cup of the
sugar, and the lemon juice in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2
hours, stirring the mixture every 30 minutes. 2.Remove the peaches
from the refrigerator and drain the juice into another bowl. Return
the peaches to the refrigerator. 3.Whisk the eggs in a mxing bowl
until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 3/4 cup
sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely
blended, about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to
blend. Add the peach juice and blend. 4. Transfer the mixture to an
ice cream maker and freeze following manufacturer's instructions.
5.After the ice cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before if is sone)
add the peaches, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready.
Makes 1 generous quart.
