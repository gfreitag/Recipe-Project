Title: FRENCH BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
3 3/4 c  Unbleached white flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Wheatgerm
1 tb Dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
In a bowl, stir together 3 c flour with salt & wheatgerm. Combine the
yeast & the water & set aside till the yeast starts to work. Make a
well in the centre of the dry ingredients & pour in the yeast &
water. Slowly work in the flour from the sides of the bowl, then beat
the mixture vigorously until thoroughly stirred together. This is a
sticky dough. Flour a board with 3/4 c flour plus 2 tb & turn out the
dough. Turn the bread so that is coated on all sides. Knead
thoroughly. Fold dough in half & roll out into a narrow shape about
12 inches long. Set on an oiled pan & allow to rise till it is nearly
doubled in size. Preheat oven to 375F & bake for 45 minutes.
