Carefully pit the cherries, leaving whole. Beat the sugar, egg yolks
and egg together until smooth. Beat in 1/3 cup butter then the flour,
rum, zest and milk. Batter should be very smooth. If desired, batter
can be mixed quickly in a blender.

Coat a 9 inch baking dish or pan with remaining butter. Arrange
cherries on the bottom and pour the batter over. Bake in a preheated
400 degree oven for 35 - 40 minutes or until golden brown and lightly
puffed and set.

Serve warm with a dusting of powdered sugar and a dollop or two of
creme fraiche.

*To Make Creme Fraiche:

Add 3 tablespoons cultured buttermilk or 1 cup cultured sour cream to
2 cups heavy cream in a saucepan. Warm gently to about 90 degrees.
Off heat and pour into a clean jar. Cover loosely and allow to sit at
room temperature (75 - 80 degrees) for 6 - 8 hours or overnight until
cream is very thick. Stir gently, cover and refrigerate for up to 2
weeks. As it ages, creme fraiche will become more tart in taste.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings
