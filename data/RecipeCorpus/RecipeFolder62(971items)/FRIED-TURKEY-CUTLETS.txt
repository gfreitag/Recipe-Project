Title: FRIED TURKEY CUTLETS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Buttermilk, lowfat
2 ts Worcestershire
2 ts Mustard
1/2 ts Cayenne
1/2    Onion, small, sliced thin
1    Garlic clove, sliced thin
1 1/2 lb Turkey breast cutlets
3/4 c  Bread crumbs
Salt and pepper
1/2    Gravy recipe
Combine the buttermilk, worcestershire, mustard, and cayenne in a
shallow baking dish. Stir in the onion and garlic and add the turkey
cutlets, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours,
or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350. Spread the bread crumbs on a baking sheet and
toast for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to a plate
and season with salt and pepper.

Drain the turkey cutlets and discard the marinade. Coat the cutlets
with the seasoned bread crumbs, shaking off the excess. Coat a large
nonstick skillet with cooking spray and warm over moderately high
heat. Add one-third of the cutlets and spray them lightly. Fry the
cutlets, turning once, until cooked through and golden, about 3
minutes per side. Transfer to a platter, cover loosely with foil, and
keep warm. Wipe out the skillet and repeat with more spray and the
remaining turkey. Serve hot, spooning gravy over the top. Serve
perhaps with dumplings or spaetzle.
