Categories: Pies, Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 c  Unsalted butter; soft
4 oz Cream cheese; soft
2 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 c  Fresh pitted cherries
2 1/2 tb Minute tapioca
1/8 ts Salt
6 tb Granulated sugar
1/4 ts Almond extract
Cream together butter and cream cheese with mixer until thoroughly
blended. Using a pastry blender, cut in flour til it looks like it
may hold together if you squeezed some or it into a ball. Stop. It's
done. (If you overmix, it will be tough). Chill well.

When chilled, cut in half, using one half of the dough to pat into a
9 inch glass pie dish. Chill again.

Filling: Combine all the ingredients for the filling and let stand
for 30 minutes stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, take reserved dough and place between 2 sheets of waxed
paper. Roll out large enough for top crust.

Pour cherry filling into pie dish and top with rolled crust. Make
attractive slits and bake at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes.
