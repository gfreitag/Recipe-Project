Title: FROZEN STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRI MIX
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Lime juice
Which is juice from 2 medium
Limes
1/4 c  Water
1 qt Fresh strawberries -- washed
And hulled
Combine sugar, lime juice and water in a bowl. Stir to mix, and then
let stand until sugar is almost completely dissolved, about 15
minutes (mixture will be thick) In a blender or food processor,
combine the sugar and lime juice with the berries. Blend until
smooth, pack into freezer containers, and freeze. The mixture will
harden to the consistency of a very firm sherbet, so you will be able
to scoop portions from the main batch, then reseal its container.  An
alternative method for packing would be to pour the mixture into ice
cube trays and freeze until firm, then unmold and pack into
resealable freezer bags. Yields about 4-2/3 cups. For each strawberry
daiquiri: In blender jar, combine 3 tablespoons rum (light or dark),
1/4 cup Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri Mix (2 average-sized cubes that
have been frozen in ice cube trays) and about 3/4 cup of ice cubes (7
or 8 average sized cubes). Blend until smooth. Most blender jars can
handle up to 4 servings. For a non-alcoholic frozen drink, replace
the rum with unsweetened pineapple juice. For a Strawberry Pina
Colada: In blender jar, combine 3 tablespoons rum (light or dark),
1/4 cup Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri Mix, 3 tablespoons unsweetened
pineapple juice, 1 tablespoon coconut cream, and about 3/4 cup of ice
cubes. For a non-alcoholic version, omit the rum. Source: Oregon food
