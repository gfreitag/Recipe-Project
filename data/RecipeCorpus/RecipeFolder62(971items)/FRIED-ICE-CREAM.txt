The day before serving, make the batter.  Mix the flour, sugar, salt,

Refrigerate overnight.  Also, the day before serving, coat the ice
cream balls thoroughly with the crushed cornflakes. Place the ice
cream balls in the coldest part of the freezer and freeze overnight.
When ready to serve, heat the peanut oil, in a deep fat fryer or deep
pot, to 375 Degrees F. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold into
the batter. Coat 2 or three of the ice cream balls completely and
heavily with the batter and add to the hot oil. Turn up the heat to
maintain a temperature of 375 Degrees F. Fry the ice cream until
golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels, draining
briefly.  Serve immediately.  Repeat with the remaining ice cream
balls.
