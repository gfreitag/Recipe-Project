Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Cuba, Update
Yield: 20 Servings
3 tb Salted butter
1/2 md Onion, finely chopped
1 ea Clove garlic, finely chopped
1/4 c  Dry sherry
6 ea To 7 ounces cooked or
-canned crabmeat, picked
-over and flaked
1 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
4 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
Peanut or vegetable oil for
-frying
Fresh lime juice to taste
1 ea In a large skillet over low
-heat, melt the butter.
-When it begins to
foam, add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the sherry, crabmeat, and parsley and cook, stirring, until the
onion is tender, another 5 minutes. 2. In a large bowl, sift the
flour together with the baking powder, salt, and pepper. Pour in the
eggs and mix by hand until the batter is smooth. Add the
onion-and-crab mixture and stir to blend. Refrigerate the batter,
covered, at least 2 hours. 3. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. In a
large heavy-bottomed skillet or deep fryer over medium-high heat,
heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees, or until a drop of batter
sizzles when it touches the oil, and fry 1 tablespoon of batter until
golden brown. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary in the
remaining batter, then drop the mixture by tablespoonfuls into the
hot oil, and fry the fritters until golden brown on all sides,
turning with a slotted spoon. Do not fry too many at once, or the oil
temperature will fall and they will be soggy rather than crisp. Place
the fritters on a paper-towel-lined platter in the oven until all
have been cooked, and serve hot, sprinkled with lime juice. Makes 20
to 25 fritters Mary Urrutia Randelman "Memories of a Cuban Kitchen"
