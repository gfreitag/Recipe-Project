Categories: Cheese, Eggs, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 ea Eggs; lg
1/3 c  Milk or light cream
1/2 ts Salt
8 ea White bread; slices
1 x  Mustard; prepared
4 ea Cheddar cheese; thick,slices
3 ts Butter
Set out a heavy skillet or cast iron griddle.  Beat the eggs slightly
in a pie tin or shallow bowl and add the milk or cream and salt, set
aside. Spread the bread slices out on a flat working surface. Spread
one side of four slices of bread lightly with the prepared mustard.
Top each with a slice of cheddar cheese. Butter the remaining four
slices of bread and top each cheese slice with bread, butter side
down. Heat the butter in the skillet or on the griddle. Carefully dip
each sandwich into the egg mixture, coating both sides. Allow the
excess egg mixture to drain back into the bowl.  Dip only as many
sandwiches as will lie flat in the skillet or griddle.  Cook over low
heat until browned. Turn and brown the other sides.  Repeat for the
remaining sandwiches and if necessary, add more butter to the skillet
or griddle to prevent sticking. Or you can place the sandwiches,
after dipping, on a well greased baking sheet and brown in the oven
at 450 degrees F. for 8 to 10 minutes. Serve hot.
