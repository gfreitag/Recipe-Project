Title: FRENCH POTATO SALAD WITH BACON
Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
9    New potatoes, 1 lb.
1/4 lb Bacon
1/4 c  Finely chopped shallots
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Chopped purple onion
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
1.  Scrub potatoes and quarter them and drop into a kettle of cold
salted water. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender but still firm
about 8-10 minutes after water reaches boil. 2. Meanwhile, chop the
bacon and saute in a small skillet until crisp. Remove bacon and
reserve. 3. In the bacon fat, saute chopped shallots until tender but
not at all brown, about 5 minutes or so. Reserve shallots and fat. 4.
When the potatoes are done, drain them and drop them into a mixing
bowl. 5. Pour vinegar, olive oil, shallots, and reserved bacon fat
over the still hot potatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste,
and gently toss. Add purple onion and parsley and toss again. Cool to
room temperature, cover and refrigerate. 6. Before serving bring back
to room temperature, toss, correct seasonings, and add additional oil
and vinegar, if the salad seems dry. Sprinkle reserved bacon on top.
