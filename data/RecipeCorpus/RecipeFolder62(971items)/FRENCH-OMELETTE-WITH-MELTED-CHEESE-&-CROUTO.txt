1 oz Grated Gruyere or Cheddar
-cheese
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE CROUTONS---------------------------
1/2    Slice White Bread

French omelettes are quite thick, so the size of the pan is
important, for a 3 egg omelette you need a 5-inch frying pan,
10-inches for a 6 egg omelette and so on. Cut the bread into small
squares of about half to quarter of an inch. Fry them in oil gently
and remove from the pan as soon as they turn golden. Wipe the pan out
and put in the butter. In a bowl lightly beat the three eggs. Heat
the butter until it hisses. The moment it stops hissing pour in the
three beaten eggs and with the back of a fork, scramble them in the
hot butter for about a minute until all the egg is cooked. When it
looks sort of soft scrambled addd the cheese, sprinkle over the
croutons and season. While the middle is still a little moist, fold
it with a palette knife or fork and tip it onto a warm plate. The
omelette will go on cooking for another 35 seconds to a minute after
you have taken it out so unless you like eggy shoe leather, take it
out of the pan just before it is cooked. It is a wonderful omelette,
slightly soft in the middle, crunchy and cheesy.
