Title: FRUIT CRESCENTS
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Pk. cream cheese, softened
1 c  Butter
2 c  Flour
Apricot preserves or*
Confectioners sugar
* raspberry or other fruit preserves

These are easy to make and you can use any variety of fruit
preserves.

In a large bowl, cut cream cheese and butter into flour. Mix into a
smooth ball. Chill dough for about
30    minutes.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Roll dough out onto wax paper, about 1/8- 1/4
inch thick. Cut into 3-inch squares. Put 1 teaspoon preserves
slightly off the center of each square. Fold dough over to enclose
preserves and form a triangle, but don't come quite to the edge with
the top flap. Roll dough toward the point and smooth and seal edges.
Bend in ends of rolled dough to give a crescent effect.

Bake at 350ø for 25-30 minutes, or until light brown. Remove and
cool on wire racks. Roll in confectioners sugar.

Yield: about 2 dozen. Rosa Linaris, Silver Spring, MD
