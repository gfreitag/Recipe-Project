Title: FRIED MELT
Categories: Pork, Reinactment, Main dish, Innards
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Fresh pork melt (spleen)
Flour
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper to taste
Brown lard
Cut melts into 1 1/2-inch cubes after thoroughly rinsing.  Roll in
flour to coat well.  Melt lard in a cast iron skillet until it begins
to smoke. Dump in the meat. Stir constantly but gently until the
flour is browned in the hot lard.  Add salt and pepper.  Continue
cooking for a few minutes until melt is cooked (much like liver).
Serve hot.

NOTE:  The spleen is much like the liver in taste, but a bit more
delicate. It also has a much lighter and finer texture without
gristle or strings. If you like liver, you will love melts.  It is
also great for campfire cooking.
