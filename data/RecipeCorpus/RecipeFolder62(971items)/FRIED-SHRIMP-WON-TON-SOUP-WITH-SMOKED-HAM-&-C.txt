Heung Tao Yee Foo Won Ton is rarely seen on the English side of the
Chinese menu. the dumplings are deep-fried then covered with broth
garnished with lacy shreds of egg white. Thefinished soup gets a
sprinkling of chopped cilantro, green onions and Smithfield ham.

To deep-fry won ton:

Preheat a wok or deep saucepan over medium-high heat until hot. Add at
least 2 inches oil; heat to 365.

Deep-fry the won ton in batches, without crowding and turning
occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.

Remove with a skimmer, drain on paper towels. Put won tons in a
shallow 3-quart soup tureen.

Bring chicken stock, soy sauce, sherry and white pepper to a boil in a
large stockpot. Stir in cornstarch mixture and cook until soup
thickens, about 15 seconds. Fold in sesame oil. Remove stockpot from
heat.

Lightly beat the egg whites just to break them up a bit. Stir soup in
a circular motion while slowly and in a steady stream pouring in the
egg whites. The whites should set within seconds into a lacy pattern.

Pour soup over won tons, garnish with chopped onions, cilantro and
Smithfield ham. Serve hot.
