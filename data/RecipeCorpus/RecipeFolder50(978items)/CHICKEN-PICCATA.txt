Title: CHICKEN PICCATA
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
5    Chicken breasts
Pepper
Flour to dredge
1/4 c  Olive oil
5    Garlic cloves, sliced
1/4 c  Wine, white
1/4 c  Demi-glace (opt.)
Lemon juice from 1 lemon
1/2 c  Butter
Parsley, chopped finely
Bone and skin chicken breasts. Gently pound the meat with a mallet
until thin and flat but not broken. Sprinkle meat with black pepper,
dredge lightly in flour.

Preheat a heavy wide skillet. Add the olive oil and saute the garlic
until lightly browned, then remove and reserve. Turn up the heat and
fry the chicken quickly. Remove the chicken and set aside.

Drain oil from pan, then deglaze pan with white wine. Add demi-glace
if desired, lemon juice and the reserve garlic. Stir well to heat the
sauce thoroughly. Add the butter. The garlic can be removed with a
slotted spoon or left in. Add the parsley and spoon over the chicken.

This dish is excellent when prepared with Chukar, pheasant, Hungarian
partridge, blue grouse or ruffed grouse. The demi-glace can be left
out.
