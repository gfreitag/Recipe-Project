with 1 teaspoon salt and diced lemon while making the sauce.

Cook onions in clarified butter over medium heat until the onions are
soft and golden brown. Add 1/4 cup water to prevent burning. Add
berbere and cook for 7 to 10 minutes. Add the to- matoes and cook an
additional 10 minutes. Add 1 cup water, simmer for 1 minute.

Drain chicken, discard the lemon chunks. Put chicken into the sauce.
Add the garlic, ginger and salt. Cook 45 minutes, or until chicken is
done. Remove from heat; sprinkle with black pepper.

Before serving, peel the hard-cooked eggs and poke with a fork on 4
sides. Carefully place eggs into the sauce. Serve with rice injera
(crepelike bread).
