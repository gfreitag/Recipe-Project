MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 ea Chicken
3 tb Butter
1/2 tb Mustard, Dijon
1/2 c  Juice, orange
1/4 c  Sugar, brown
1 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water
1/8 c  Vodka
Cut chickens in half lengthwise.  Blend butter and mustard together.
Rub chicken inside and out with this mixture. Place chicken, skin
side down, in baking dish with tight-fitting cover.

Preheat oven to 375. Combine orange juice and brown sugar, stirring
until sugar is completely dissolved. Pour over and around chicken.
Cover and bake for 30 minutes.

Turn chicken over, baste with pan juices, and continue to bake,
uncovered, for 20 minutes longer, basting occasionally.

Remove chicken to heated platter and keep warm.  Mix cornstarch with
water. Stir this into juices from pan. Cook over low heat, stirring
constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat, stir in vodka, and
pour sauce over chicken.

Sylvia's comments: I'm unenthusiastic about this one, and I'm not
sure why. The chicken was pretty bland, but chicken usually tastes
bland to me, and the sauce was certainly flavorful. The combination
of mustard and orange juice didn't do a thing for my taste buds. It
also took about 1/2 hour longer to bake than the recipe called for.
Next time, I think I'll leave out the mustard/butter rub, add a
little pumpkin pie spice to the orange juice/brown sugar mixture, and
cook the whole mess in the crockpot rather than the oven.
