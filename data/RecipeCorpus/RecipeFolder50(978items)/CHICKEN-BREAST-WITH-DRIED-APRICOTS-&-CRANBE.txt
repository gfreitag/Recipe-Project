NATHALIE DUPREE COOKS SHOW#ND016 Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a
saucepan heat wine just to boiling. Remove from heat, add apricots,
and soak for 10 minutes. Drain, reserving wine and apricots
separately. In a large, heavy casserole arrange chicken pieces,
skin-side up and sprinkle with onion, spices, salt, pepper, plumped
apricots and cranberries. Combine reserved wine and stock and pour
over all. Cover casserole tightly and bake until chicken is very
tender, 50 to 60 minutes.
