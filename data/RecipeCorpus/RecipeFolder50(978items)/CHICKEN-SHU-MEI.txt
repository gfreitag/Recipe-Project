Title: CHICKEN SHU-MEI
Categories: Chinese, Dim sum, Appetizers, Chicken
Yield: 1 Servings
=== The Filling ===
1 lb Ground chicken
2 tb Light soy sauce
2 tb Dry sherry
1 ts Freshly grated ginger
1/2 ts Ground white pepper
1 tb Sesame oil
1/2 ts Msg
1 pn Sugar
1 tb Chopped green onion
1    Egg white
1 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Salt
4 tb Medium-chopped bamboo
Shoots
OR water chestnuts
2    Garlic cloves -- crushed
=== The Wrapper ===
1 pk Shu-mei skins or gyoza
Skins
* Note:  Available at most supermarkets.   Mix together all the
ingredients for the filling;  mix them well. Place about 3/4
tablespoon of the filling in the   center of each noodle wrapper and
bring up the corners so that you have a little money bag. Leave the
top open so you can see some of the meat. For fun you  might put 1
frozen green pea  on the top of each for added color. Steam in an
oiled bamboo steamer for 15 minutes on high heat.
Note:  You can  also add a bit of shrimp to this dish. It adds a
great deal of flavor.   Try about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh shrimp.
Hint: Use lettuce circles for steaming small dumplings. Simply cut
iceberg lettuce into  small  circles using a cookie cutter. Place a
little circle under each dumpling o r shu-mei. No stick and lots of
flavor. Comments: These are easy to make and probably the most
popular dim sum I know. They resemble little money bags and are
offered at the Chinese New Year because they help anticipate wealth.
