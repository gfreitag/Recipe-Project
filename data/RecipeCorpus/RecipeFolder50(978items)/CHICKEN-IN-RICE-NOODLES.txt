Title: CHICKEN IN RICE NOODLES
Categories: Poultry, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
450 g  Uncooked chicken
450 g  Vermicelli-size rice
Noodles
1/2 c  Chopped cilantro (fresh, not
Dried)
1/2 c  Chopped green onion
1/3 c  Ground peanuts
1/2 c  French-fried onion (I use
Durkee's brand)
55 ml Soy sauce
55 ml Malt vinegar
30 ml Lemon juice
30 ml Fish sauce (nampla)
1 tb Powdered galanga (or
Substitute ginger)
2 ts Ground black pepper
4    Cloves garlic
1 tb Chili oil or red pepper
Flakes (optional)
1.  Cut up chicken into bite-size pieces, then marinate for 45-60
minutes in a mixture of the marinade ingredients.

2.  Cook rice noodles and drain them.

3.  Dump the chicken and marinade into large skillet and stir on high
heat until chicken is cooked.

4.  Mix cooked chicken and marinade into the noodles. Also mix in
cilantro, green onions and peanuts.

5.  Garnish with french-fried onion. If you mix this in instead of
adding it on top, the onions get soggy too quickly.

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: measure ingredients.
