Title: CHICKEN SALTIMBOCCA
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Ground black pepper
1/2 c  Buttermilk
2    Boneless chicken breasts
- each split in half
4 sl Ham
8    Fresh sage leaves; -=OR=-
1 ts -Dried Sage
1/2 c  Flour
2 c  Cooking oil
COMBINE PEPPER AND BUTTERMILK in a bowl or glass pie dish large
enough to hold the chicken in one layer and set aside. Place the
flour on a plate and set aside. Place a slice of ham under the skin
of the chicken and place 2 sage leaves or some dried sage inside.
Place the breasts in the buttermilk and place in the refrigerator for
20 minutes. Turn the breasts over and let sit another 20 minutes.
Heat a 1-inch depth of oil in a heavy skillet to 375F. Oil is hot
enough for frying when a droplet of water bubbles and dances across
the surface. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator, remove from
the marinade and wipe off excess buttermilk. Dust the breasts on both
sides with flour and place in the hot oil. Cook about 6 minutes, turn
and cook until a golden brown crust forms, about another 6 to 8
minutes. Remove the breasts and drain on an absorbent towel. Serve
immediately.
