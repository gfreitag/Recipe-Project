Title: CHICKEN TACO
Categories: Poultry, Mexican
Yield: 1 Servings  1 tsp margarine 1 corn or flour tortilla 1-2 tsp mild taco sauce 4
tbsp shredded chicken 2 tbsp shredded cheese 2 tbsp shredded lettuce

Heat the margarine in a frying pan and quickly saute the tortilla
(about a minute on each side).  Place the tortilla on a piece of
waxed paper. Spread the taco sauce on the tortilla. Sprinkle the
chicken, cheese, and lettuce on one third of the tortilla.  Then roll
the tortilla up, starting with the side where the chicken mixture is
and folding the ends in to prevent the mixture from dripping out.
Wrap the waxed paper around the taco and pack it in a plastic bag.
Makes 1 taco.
