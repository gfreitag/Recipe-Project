250 ml Custard apple puree
200 ml Plain yogurt
3 tb Caster sugar
Olive oil
8    Pieces chicken
3 lg Onions, sliced
4    Cloves garlic, chopped
125 ml Strong chicken stock
Mix together 250 mL custard apple puree (from 2 small to medium
custard apples or 1 large one), 200 mL thick plain yoghurt (a low-fat
variety is fine) and 3 tablespoons caster sugar. Set aside.

Heat a little olive oil in a large pan with a lid and brown 8 chicken
pieces.

Meanwhile, slice 3 large onions and chop 4 cloves of garlic finely.
Remove the chicken pieces from the pan and cook the onions and garlic
gently until golden.

Add 125 mL strong chicken stock and stir to deglaze the pan, return
the chicken to the pan, cover and simmer until the chicken is tender
and the juices run clear when the thickest portions are pierced with
a skewer - about 45 minutes to an hour.

Remove the chicken pieces to a serving dish. Add the custard apple
mixture to the liquid remaining in the pan, stir well and season to
taste. Heat the sauce but do not let it.boil. Pour over the chicken.
