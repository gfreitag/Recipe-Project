Contributed to the echo by: Sandy Colby Originally from: The Daily
Tribune, "Micro Magic" column, written by Norma Schomwetter This was
in Today's local paper, "The Daily Tribune", in a weekly column
called _Micro Magic_, written by Norma Schomwetter. The recipe was
taken from a book titled _Microwave Entertaining_ by Marcia Cone and
Thelma Snyder. It sounded so good, I thought I'd pass it along.
Chicken breasts, Zucchini in Romaine Leaves dash cayenne pepper

Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; flatten to about
1/4"; set aside. Place romaine leaves on a 10" round micro proof
platter. Cover tightly with vented plastic wrap. Microwave on HIGH
35-50 seconds or until pliable. Place a chicken breast half on each
leaf, sprinkle with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Divide zucchini strips
into 4 bunches and place at the top of each chicken breast. Starting
at the end with the zucchini, roll the lettuce and chicken toward the
stem of the lettuce. Place rolls seam side down in a circle on the
10" platter. Cover tightly again, and microwave on HIGH 8-10 minutes,
or until chicken is cooked through. Drain juices. Save in a 2 C
measure. Let chicken stand, covered. To the 2 C measure, add the
remaining ingredients and microwave on HIGH 3-5 minutes. To serve,
spoon 2 Tbsp of sauce onto each plate.

(sjc: the ingredients don't call for any pepper except that of the
cayenne at the end of the ingredients list. I assume the cayenne goes
into the sauce, and the pepper called for earlier would be black
pepper, even though it's not mentioned. Any comments?)
