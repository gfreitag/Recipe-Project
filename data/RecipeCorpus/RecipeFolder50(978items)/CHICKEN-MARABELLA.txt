Salt and pepper; taste
1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
1/2 c  Olive oil

*Peel and finely puree the garlic. In large bowl combine all the
ingredients EXCEPT brown sugar, wine and parsley. Cover and let
marinate in the fridge overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
arrange chicken in single layer in shallow baking pans. Spoon
marinade over chicken.  Sprinkle chicken pieces with brown sugar.
Pour white wine AROUND chicken. Bake for 50 min to 1 hour. Basting
frequently with pan juices.  Serve with noodles or rice. Sprinkle
with parsley. Serve sauce (remaining juices) on the side. This sounds
'weird', but I guarentee it is delicious.  Can be served hot or cold.
