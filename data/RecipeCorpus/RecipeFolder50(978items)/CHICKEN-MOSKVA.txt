Title: CHICKEN MOSKVA
Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Frying chicken, cut up
1/4 c  Margarine
4    Green onions; thinly sliced
1    Tomato; diced
1/4 c  Boiling water
2 tb Chopped parsley
1/2 ts Sugar
Salt, pepper
1/2 c  Sour cream
1 ts Flour
1/2 ts Paprika
Rub chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat margarine; brown chicken on
both sides; add boiling water; cover and cook 30 minutes or until
chicken is done.  Remove chicken from pan; keep hot. To the juices in
pan, add onions; cook until soft.  (Save a bit for garnish from the
green tops).

Add tomatoes; cook until soft as mush; add thyme (?? ~KM) and
parsley. Salt and pepper if needed.

Mix sour cream, flour, paprika; add to onions and salt. Cook until
thick; spoon over chicken and serve. Sometimes, due to extenuating
weather conditions, the sauce will not thicken enough; when this
happens, just swallow your pride and pour over chicken anyway; it
will still taste great.
