Title: CHICKEN PERI-PERI
Categories: Other sauce, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
2 tb Cider vinegar
1/2 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Angostura bitters
1 ts Hot pepper sauce, or to
-taste
1    Dried hot red chili
1    Fresh chili (such as
-jalapeno)
2    Cloves garlic
2 lb Whole chicken breast, with
-skin and bone
Combine the lime juice, vinegar, paprika, bitters and hot pepper
sauce in a glass baking dish.

Wearing kitchen gloves, split the dried chili with a sharp paring
knife and remove the seeds.  Do the same with the jalapeno pepper.
Mash the peppers with the garlic into a smooth paste using a mortar
or an electric spice grinder.  Add the paste to the lime mixture in
the baking dish and combine.

Toss the chicken pieces and swish them in the marinade until they are
completely coated.  Cover and let marinate overnight in the
refrigerator.

Remove the chicken from the marinade and grill or broil until cooked
through and burnished, about 20 minutes on each side. Baste
frequently with the marinade. If the chicken looks like it is
beginning to burn, move it farther away from the heat source. Serve
hot with chilled orange sections and plenty of napkins.

Makes 4 servings.

NOTE:  "Peri-peri, the national hot sauce of Zimbabwe, is an ancestor
of many of our Acadian (and other southern) hot sauces. It enhances
lamb, beef and fish as well as chicken, and a splash in the glass
makes a mean Bloody Mary."
