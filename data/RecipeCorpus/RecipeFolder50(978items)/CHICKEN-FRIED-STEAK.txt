Title: CHICKEN FRIED STEAK
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2/3 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
Freshly ground Pepper
2 lb Top Round or Chuck Steak
- cut 1/4" - 1/2" thick
-   (tenderized)
2    Eggs
2 tb Cream
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Saltine cracker crumbs,
-rolled fine
1    Onion; sliced
--- GRAVY FIXINGS ---
1/2 c  Cream
2 c  Chicken stock (approx.)
Mix 1/2 cup of the flour, the salt and the pepper together. Pound the
mixture into both sides of the meat with the edge of a heavy plate or
mallet. Cut the meat into serving-size pieces. Beat the eggs together
with the cream. Heat the oil in a heavy iron skillet over moderately
high heat. Reserve 3 tablespoons of the flour. Dredge the steaks in
the remainder of the flour, dip in the egg mixture, and then into the
cracker crumbs. Add to the hot oil. Brown the steaks well, turn and
brown the other side. Reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet, and
cook for 15-to-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the steaks are
cooked through and tender. Chicken-fried steak should be well done,
but not dry. Remove the steaks from the pan, and drain on paper
towels. --- GRAVY FIXINGS --- Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the
fat in the skillet, and stir in 3 tablespoons of the flour. Stir to
incorporate any particles in the bottom of the pan and cook for
1-to-2 minutes. Stir in the cream, then the chicken stock. Slice the
meat across the grain and top with the gravy. It's great served with
mashed potatoes, homemade biscuits or cornbread, and a green
vegetable.
