Title: CHICKEN OR VEAL MARSALA
Categories: Main dish, Chicken, Party
Yield: 4 Servings
-GRAMMIE'S KITCHEN
4    Chicken cutlets, skinless
-breasts
-=OR=- Veal scallops; 1 LB
-pounded if over 1/4 "
1/4 c  Flour,
-Salt & pepper
3 tb Olive oil; MIXED with
1 tb Butter
2 cl Garlic; smashed
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Marsala
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms; sliced
-=OR=- canned; drained
IN A HOT NO STICK pan; saute the garlic until it becomes light brown.
In the meantime, dust chicken cutlets w/flour and saute in oil until
golden brown on both sides, (in garlic flavored oil). Do it quickly
and lightly. Remove from skillet and set aside.

ADD the mushrooms and saute until wilted. Pour the 1/2 cup dry
Marsala wine into the pan and scrape up the brown bits that are on
the bottom. Add 1/2 cup chicken stock (your own or a good quality
store bought brand) and stir very well, reducing the liquid in the
pan just a little. Return veal or chicken to the pan and simmer
(BARELY) for about 15 minutes. Serve over rice or noodles.

NOTE:  I have always used fresh mushrooms; tonight I found that my
fresh ones were not so fresh so I used two 3oz cans of sliced
mushrooms. We could hardly believe our tastebuds; as good or better.
You can also hold this in a warm oven.  It will wait for you.

Remember you can do this with veal as well.  I think it is the easiest
fanciest dish I have.
