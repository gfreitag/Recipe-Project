Title: CHICKEN ENCHILADA BAKE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/2 c  Onions, chopped
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Water
1/2 tb Stock, chicken, powdered
4 oz Cream, sour
MMMMM-------------------------ENCHILADAS------------------------------
1 c  Chicken, cooked; chopped
1 c  Cheese, cheddar, shredded
1/2 cn Green chilies; drained
1 oz Pimientos, sliced
1/4 ts Chili powder
6 lg Tortillas, flour
1/4 c  Cheese, cheddar, shredded
Sauce: Cook onion in butter until tender. Stir in flour, water and
bouillon; cook and stir until sauce thickens and bouillon dissolves.
Remove from heat; stir in sour cream.

Preheat oven to 350.  Combine chicken, cheese, chilies, pimientos,
chili powder, and enough sauce to moisten; mix well. Dip each
tortilla into sauce to soften; fill each with equal portions of
chicken mixture and roll up. Arrange in a lightly greased 13x9"
baking dish; spoon remaining sauce over enchiladas.  Sprinkle with
cheese and parsley.  Bake
25    minutes, or until bubbly.

Serve with additional sour cream, if desired.

Sylvia's comments: I've never tried making enchiladas before, and was
surprised and delighted at how easy they were. The sauce was blah and
didn't suit the enchiladas at all, but I have lots of sauce recipes!
So I'm going to make it again, substituting some other sauces for
this one. Also, I left this sitting in the fridge two days before
baking it, with no negative result except it took longer than 25
minutes to get it hot.
