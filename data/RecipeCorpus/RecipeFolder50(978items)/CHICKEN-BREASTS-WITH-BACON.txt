Title: CHICKEN BREASTS WITH BACON
Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
6    Whole chicken breasts (skin
Boned, salt lightly)
2    Bunches of green onions
(chopped include some green
8 oz. cream cheese
1 lb Bacon (more or less)
Cream together cheese and chopped onions; form into 12 walnut sized
balls. Wrap half a chicken breast around each one, and one or two
slices of bacon around that in such a way as to cover as much of the
chicken as possible. Secure each little bundle with a toothpick or
two. Then broil them on a rack, with a drip pan underneath 6 to 8
inches from the broiler unit. Turn occasionally, as they brown, and
broil about 30 minutes, or until the bacon is done.
