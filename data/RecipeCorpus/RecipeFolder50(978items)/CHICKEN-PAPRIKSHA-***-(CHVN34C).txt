Now it is your turn to bear with me. I have a delicious Chicken
Papriksha recipe, but it is in my head, as it was taught by my mother
in law and never written down; Season the chicken well with salt,
pepper and garlic powder (Optional), top chicken pieces with lot of
paprika (both sides). In a large frying pan (that has a lid) melt
some margarine and sautee chicken pieces till well browned,** add 1/2
cup of water and cover pan, let it cook for 15 minutes. Mix soup and
sour cream add to chicken mixing well with the juice that chicken has
been cooking .Cook for a few more minutes and ENJOY! I serve it with
butter noodles. ** before adding water you can drain some of the fat
margarine) if there is too much. Let me know when you try>> or if you
do not understand. You can use chicken with or without skin. 11/18
