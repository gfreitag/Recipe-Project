Title: CHICKEN WINGS WITH ORANGE-MUSTARD GLAZE
Categories: Poultry, Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
2    Garlic clove(s)
Finely chopped
1/2 c  Yellow onion(s)
Finely chopped
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Orange juice
(about 1 1/2 oranges)
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Orange zest, finely grated
(about 2 oranges)
1/2 c  Dijon mustard
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Dry mustard
1 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Cider vinegar
1/2 tb Salt
24    Chicken wings
(about 2 1/2 lb)
In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the garlic and
onion and saute until translucent, about 5 min. Stir in the lemon
juice, orange juice, sugar, orange zest, Dijon mustard,
Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard, brown sugar, vinegar, and salt.
Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until the sugar
dissolves and the sauce begins to thicken to the consistency of warm
honey, about 10 min. Remove from the heat and let cool to room
temperature.

Put the chicken wings in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Pour the
cooled mixture over them, then turn the wings to make sure they are
well coated. Let stand for 1 hour or more, turning from time to time.
(If allowed to marinate for more than 1 hour, cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Remove the wings from the marinade with a slotted spoon, reserving the
marinade, and spread them on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet.
Bake, basting occasionally with the marinade, until the wings are
cooked through and slightly crispy, 20-30 min. Serve the wings hot or
cold.
