Title: CHICKEN STYLE SEASONING
Categories: Seasoning, Spices, Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/3 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
3 tb Onion powder
2 1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 tb Salt
1 ts Celery seed
2 1/2 tb Italian seasoning
2 tb Parsley, dried
Blend smooth all ingredients except parsley.  Stir in parsley. Store
in airtight container.

Notes:

Use this seasoning to make a quick chicken-like stock out of water
when you have no veggie stock on hand. Excellent for flavoring rice
and as a soup base.

Make a very simple, easy, and good-tasting gravy by mixing water,
seasoning, and miso (I like the dark brown rice miso). Typical
proportions: 1.5 cups water, 1 T seasoning, 2 t miso.
Increase/decrease seasonings according your your taste.  Right before
serving gravy, mix some starch (I frequently use potato starch) in a
bit of water till well-blended and add to gravy to thicken (do this
over medium heat). Add starch until you reach desired thickness.
Quick, easy, and surprisingly tastey. From _Country Kitchen
