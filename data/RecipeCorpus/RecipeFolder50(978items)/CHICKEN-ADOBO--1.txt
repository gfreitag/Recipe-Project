thoroughly after cutting to ensure all bone slivers are removed.
Combine the garlic, bay leaf, pepper, shoyu and vinegar. Marinate the
chicken 2 to 3 hours, turning often. Simmer the chicken in the
marinade until tender (20 to 30 minutes). Use a slotted spoon to
remove the chicken. Strain the marinade and set aside. Saute the
