1/4 c  Low sodium soy sauce
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1 ts Oriental seesame oil
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 tb Sherry
1 tb Minced, peeled, fresh ginger
Root OR 1 ts dried ginger

1.  Combine soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, sherry, ginger
root
and chicken.  Marinate chicken at room temperature
1    hour, or
refrigerate if marinating longer.

2.  Heat olive oil in non-stick wok or skillet. Transfer chicken from
marinade to skillet and saute until barely cooked, about 2
minutes.
Add a little marinade if needed.

3.  Add prepared vegetables and stir-fry until crisp tender.

4.  Warm pita bread in microwave oven if desired.

5.  Stuff pita bread with filling.

NOTE: If you haven't tried low sodium soy sauce, it is time to go
with it.
Kikkoman makes it with a green label.  The taste is the same, but the
sodium level is way down, so it's much better for you.
