Categories: Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
4 ea Chicken breast halves; skin
3/4 c  Parmesan; freshly grated
2 tb Parmesan; freshly grated
3/4 c  Breadcrumbs; fresh white
1 tb Parsley; minced fresh
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper; freshly ground
1 ea Egg
1/2 c  Milk
2 c  Olive oil
2 tb Butter; unsalted
2 tb Lemon juice; fresh
1 ea Lemon; quartered
1 x  Parsley springs; fresh
Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of
3/8 inch, using meat mallet or rolling pin. Mix cheese, breadcrumbs,
minced parsley, salt and pepper in large bowl. Whisk egg with milk in
medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into breadcrumb
mixture, coating completely and pressing to adhere. Shake off excess
breadcrumbs. Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add
chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 4
minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels and drain.
Transfer chicken to platter. Melt butter in small saucepan. Mix in
lemon juice and pour over chicken. Garnish with lemon wedges and
parsley sprigs. *** My notes: I found that 3/4 cup each parmesan and
breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts, so I
reduced the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for
6 breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.
