Categories: Chicken, Low-fat
Yield: 4 Servings
6 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 1/4 c  Chinese rice wine
-or dry sherry
1 c  Honey
2 ts Salt
4    Star anise
1    Cinnamon stick
2    Strips orange zest
1    Chicken (3 1/2 to 4 lb)

5    Scallions

-for garnish
1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
-for garnish
2 ts Sesame oil (opt)
Combine all the ingredients except the chicken, sesame oil, and
garnishes in a deep pot just large enough to hold the chicken. Bring
to a boil. Add the chicken and simmer for 40-50 minutes, or until
cooked, turning the bird form time to time to make sure it poaches
evenly. Skim the mixture often with a shallow ladle to remove any fat
that rises to the surface. The chicken is done when the juices run
clear when a skewer is inserted into the thick part of the thigh.

Drain the chicken, reserve the broth. Remove the trussing string;
carve the chicken and cut it into pieces. Sprinkle with scallion
greens and cilantro. Serve hot, at room temperature, or chilled.

To serve, place chicken in shallow soup bowls with broth ladled over
it. Sprinkle with chopped scallions and cilantro. Or brush the
chicken pieces with sesame oil and brown them on the grill or under
the broiler, then sprinkle with chopped scallions and cilantro.,

Note: The broth can and should be reused. Strain it and let it cool
to room temperature. Chill overnight in the refrigerator and skim off
any fat that collects on the surface. Freeze into you're ready to use
it again. To reuse, bring the broth to a boil, adding seasoning and
water as necessary. The flavor improves each time you use it.
