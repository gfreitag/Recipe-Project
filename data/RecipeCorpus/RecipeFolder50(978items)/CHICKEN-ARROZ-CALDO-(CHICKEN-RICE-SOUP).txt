In a large non-stick soup pot over medium heat, saute garlic in oil
until lightly brown.  Add ginger and onion, stir for a minute. Add
chicken pieces and fish saue and cook for another 3 minutes. Add
rice, water and a little salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer in medium
low heat for about 40 minutes or until the consistency of a light
ceamed soup has been reached. Stir occasionally while cooking.
Correct seasonings to taste. Stir in a small amount of sliced green
onions. If rice soup becomes too thick, add a little water to thin it
a bit.  Garnish individual bowl servings with sliced green onions
just before servings. Tips: If you prefer, sprinkle a little lemon
juice on the soup servings. This will give a pleasant tartness to the
dish. Serves 6 to 8.
