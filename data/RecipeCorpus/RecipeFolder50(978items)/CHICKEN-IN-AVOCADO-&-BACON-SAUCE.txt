This Bristish dish is such an unusual combination but everybody raves
about it and is always trying to find out the recipe.

* bacon to be grilled until crispy and finely chopped. * use cooked
chicken-enough for 6 portions.

Set oven at 400 degrees. Peel and slice the onions very finely and
saute with the spices in the butter until transparent. Leave to one
side. Meanwhile, liquidize the avocados, stock and cream in a
blender. Mix in the onions and pour the mixture over the chicken in
an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle over the bacon and heat through for 20
minutes. Sylvia Mease
