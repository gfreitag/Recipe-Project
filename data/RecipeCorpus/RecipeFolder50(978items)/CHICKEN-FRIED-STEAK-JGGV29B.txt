Title: CHICKEN FRIED STEAK JGGV29B
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 84 Servings
TINA CLARNO
1 ea Eggs -- well beaten
1 c  Flour -- (to 2 cups)
1 tb Water
1/4 ts Nutmeg mixed in w/b crumbs
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
(JGGV29B)
Dredge steaks in flour then egg then bread crumbs coating well. Do
that to all of them and then brown in hot oil. Turn to low and cook
till done depending on how thick the steaks are. I serve Mashed
Potatoes, vegies, Rolls, and White Gravy.  My husband prefers white
over brown and the white is better I think.  If you need the gravy
recipe let me know. Hope this wets your appetite!! Reformatted by:
