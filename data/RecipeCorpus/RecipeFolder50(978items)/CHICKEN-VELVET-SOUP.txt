the remainder for other uses.

SOUP:  Blend the butter and flour together in a medium (3-quart)
saucepan. Warm the cream in a seperate pan. Add the warmed cream to
the butter-flour mixture and stir until smooth. It will start to
thicken when it is heated. Stir in two cups of the hot stock.  Cook
over low heat, stirring, until heated through and blended, about 4
minutes. Add an additional 4 cups of stock and the chopped chicken.
Season to taste with salt, if desired, and pepper.  Heat to serving
temperature--steaming, but not boiling or the cream will break. Watch
the pot closely to keep from coming to a boil.

SERVICE:  Serve from a heated tureen and ladle into heated bowls.
Garnish with snippets of fresh parsley. YIELD: About 8 servings.
