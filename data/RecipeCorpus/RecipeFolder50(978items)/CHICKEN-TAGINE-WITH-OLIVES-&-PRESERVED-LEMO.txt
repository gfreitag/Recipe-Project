Heat the oil in a large enameled cast-iron casserole. Season the
chicken pieces with the salt and pepper and add them to the casserole
along with the onion, ginger, cinnamon, and saffron. Cook over high
heat, turning the chicken occasionally, until browned all over, about
10 min. Add the tomatoes, garlic, parsley, cilantro and 2 c. of water
and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer,
stirring occasionally, until the chicken is tender, about 1 hour.
(The recipe can be prepared up to this point up to 2 days ahead;
cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before continuing.)

Meanwhile, rinse the preserved lemons under running water; pat dry.
Separate the lemons into quarters. Discard the pulp from one of the
lemons and finely chop the peel. Reserve the quarters for garnish.

Transfer the chicken to a large plate.  Strain the cooking liquid and
return it to the casserole. Boil over high heat until slightly
thickened, about 10 min. Add the chopped preserved lemon and the
olives and simmer over moderate heat for 2 min. Add the chicken
pieces and simmer until heated through.

Arrange the chicken pieces in a serving dish.  Pour the sauce on top
and garnish with the lemon quarters.
