Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Flour -- (for dredging)
Salt and pepper -- to taste
4 ea Chicken breasts -- skinless,

2 tb Olive oil
4    Sprigs thyme -- (1 tsp

2 tb Shallots -- finely chopped

2 ts Lemon rind -- grated
3 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Chicken broth -- fresh or

2 tb Butter or margarine
Season flour with salt and pepper, and dredge the chichen all over.
Shake off excess flour.

Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken
pieces in one layer.  Add chicken and cook, uncovered, over medium
heat for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

Turn the chicken and cook for 5 more minutes, or until cooked through.
Carefully remove the oil from the skillet, leaving the chicken.
Discard the oil.

Add the thyme, shallots and garlic, and cook for about a minute. Do
not burn the garlic.  Add the lemon rind, the lemon juice and the
broth.

Scrape the skillet to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the
bottom.  Add the butter, and cook for 3 minutes longer.
