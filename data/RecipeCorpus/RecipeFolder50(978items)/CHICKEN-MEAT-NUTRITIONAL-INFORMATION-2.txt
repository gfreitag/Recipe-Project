=====================================

The United States enjoys the safest, most wholesome supply of fresh
chicken available worldwide.  But keep in mind that chicken is an
animal agricultural product and, like all such products, it can carry
certain microorganisms, most of which are harmless.  Even if harmful
bacteria are present, the numbers are usually far below levels that
would cause human illness if the product is handled safely and cooked
at normal temperatures until done.  Safe handling of chicken, or any
perishable product, isn't difficult.  These procedures included:

Don't wait, refrigerate.
------------------------

Take purchased poultry home as soon as possible and
refrigerate for use within one to two days.  Freeze for longer
storage.

Thaw in refrigerator or microwave - not at room temperature.

Don't leave cooked poultry at room temperature more than 2
hours.

Place leftovers in shallow containers and refrigerate
promptly.

Keep it clean:
--------------

Wash your hands, work surfaces, and utensils in hot soapy
water before and after contact with raw meat and poultry.

Cook thoroughly:
----------------

Cook poultry until a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees
Fahrenheit for boneless product, 170 degrees for bone-in parts, and
180 degrees for bone-in whole chickens product, OR until juices run
clear.
