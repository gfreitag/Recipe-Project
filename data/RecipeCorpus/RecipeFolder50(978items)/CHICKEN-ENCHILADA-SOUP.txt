Try using NO FAT sour cream
And it comes out very good.
Cook chicken in 12-16 cups of water until done. Debone chicken and
reserve broth.  In a large saute pan, combine margarine, onion and
garlic. Gradually add flour, seasoned salt and paprika. This will
make a white sauce.  If too thick, add a little broth and stir. Add
remaining broth and sour cream.  Stir well. Add remaining ingredients
and mix well. Cook until heated through and serve.  Serve with
tortilla chips, grated cheese, green onions and picante sauce.
