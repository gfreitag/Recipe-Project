In a large saucepan, melt the butter.  Add the onion and cook over
moderate heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in 8 cups of the
chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and white
pepper to taste.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine the remaining 1 cup stock
with the thyme, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of white
pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and beat
in the flour until thoroughly blended.  Let the mixture cool
slightly, then beat in the eggs, one at a time.

Drop tablespoons of the dumpling mixture into the simmering soup
and cook until the dumplings begin to firm, about 5 minutes. Remove
from the heat, cover the saucepan and set aside to steam the
dumplings for
3    minutes before serving.
