*Enright called this recipe "Chicken with Coriander, Ginger and
Garlic" but since coriander usually means cilantro seeds, I've
changed the name to more accurately reflect the dish's ingredients.

**About 1/3 cup.

Tuck 1 tb. cilantro, 1 tsp. ginger and 1 tsp. garlic into the cavity
of the bird.  Place chicken and remaining ingredients in a large,
heavy plastic bag; tie securely. (Or place chicken in a large,
shallow bowl with marinade ingredients.)  Marinate several hours or
overnight, turning occasionally.

Remove chicken from marinade, reserving marinade. Truss chicken (tie
or skewer wings and legs); place in roasting pan. Strain marinade and
set aside to use for basting.

Roast chicken at 425 F. until beginning to brown (15 minutes), then
reduce heat to 350 F. and roast until juices run clear when thigh
joint is pierced (another 40 to 45 minutes). Baste often during
roasting. Let stand a few minutes before carving.

Enright writes:  "This spicy bird is good served with rice and
defatted pan juices.  Thicken juices by heating with a little
whipping cream or beurre manie - equal amounts of butter and flour
kneaded into a ball."
