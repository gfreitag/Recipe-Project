Title: CHICKEN OR RABBIT
Categories: Meats, Poultry, Game, Canning
Yield: 1 Text  Procedure: Choose freshly killed and dressed, heathy animals. Large
chickens are more flavorful than fryers. Dressed chicken should be
chilled for 6 to 12 hours before canning. Dressed rabbits should be
soaked 1 hour in water containing 1 tablespoon of salt per quart, and
then rinsed. Remove excess fat. Cut the chicken or rabbit into
suitable sizes for canning. Can with or without bones.

Hot pack--Boil, steam or bake meat until about two-thirds done. Add 1
teaspoon salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with pieces
and hot broth, leaving 1-1/4 inch headspace.

Raw pack--Add 1 teaspoon salt per quart, if desired. Fill jars
loosely with raw meat pieces, leaving 1-1/4 inch headspace. Do not
add liquid.

Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or
Table 2 according to the canning method used.
