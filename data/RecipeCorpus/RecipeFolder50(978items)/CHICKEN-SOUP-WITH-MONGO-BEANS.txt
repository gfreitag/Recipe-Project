Add anchovy and cook if it is used instead of patis. Bring to boil,
then simmer until chicken is tender. While chicken is simmering, boil
beans in water until they are easy to peel.  This is done by placing
a bean between your fingers and rubbing the skin off the beans. When
this is done with ease, remove from stove and drain. Add cold water
to beans and then rub beans between your palms until almost all of
the beans have been peeled. Keep replacing cold water and peeling
will drain with water. When chicken is tender, add beans to soup and
cook until soup is thick and beans are soft. Add water, if necessary,
5 minutes before it is done++add the patis if anchovies are not
available. Variation: Bitter melons, cut in squares or leafy
vegetables such as spinach may be used. Pork may be used instead of
chicken.
