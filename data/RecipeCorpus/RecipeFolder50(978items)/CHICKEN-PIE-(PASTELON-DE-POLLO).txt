I love Puerto Rican Food!... It's usually simple, yet rich with lots
of cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can
be simplified to taste. I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and
garlic with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).

I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it
interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).

PASTRY:

Sift together flour and salt

Add shortening and cut into flour with a dough blender or two knives

Add milk and stir just enough to mix ingredients into a dough.

Place dough on a lightly-floured board and divide in half.

Set aside one half and roll out other half, with a lightly floured
rolling pin into a circle large nough to cover a 9-10 inch pie plate.
Do not stretch dough. Prick bottom and sides with a fork.

Prepare other half in the same way and set aside for top covering.

FILLING:

In a skillet, brown rapidly salt pork and cured ham in oil. Reduce
heat to low and saute onion, peppers, garlic and oregano until tender.

Wash chicken pieces, add with salt and water.  Mix over moderate heat
about
3    minutes.

Add pimientos, prunes, raisins, tomato sauce, olives, and capers and
bring rapidly to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 30
minutes.

Add ingredients included in D, mix and remove from heat.

Remove chicken pieces.  Separate meat from bones and discard bones.
Mince the meat and add to skillet.

Spoon fillling into pie plate.

Cover top with other half of dough, being careful not to stretch it.

Prick in several places with a fork.  Fasten edges of dough by
pressing together firmly with a fork dipped in milk. Brush top
lightly with milk.

Bake in preheated ove (350 degrees F) about 45 minutes or until golden
brown.
