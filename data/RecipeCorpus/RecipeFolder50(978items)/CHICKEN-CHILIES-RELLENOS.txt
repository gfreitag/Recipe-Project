Recipe by: Joel Ehrlich <Joel.Ehrlich@SALATA.COM> Preheat the oil in
the deep fryer to 400 degrees. Season each half chicken breast
lightly with salt. Flatten slightly using a meat mallet. Place 1
piece of cheese in each chile. Place each stuffed chile on the end of
one half chicken breast. Roll each chicken breast as you would a
jelly roll, enclosing the chile. Secure using toothpicks. Beat the
eggs and milk together. Dip each chicken breast roll in the egg
mixture. Dip each into the seasoned flour. Deep fry each chicken roll
until golden (4-5 minutes). Drain. Serve hot, with salsa.
