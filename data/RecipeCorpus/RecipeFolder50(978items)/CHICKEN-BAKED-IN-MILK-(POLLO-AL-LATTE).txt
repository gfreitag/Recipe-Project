Title: CHICKEN BAKED IN MILK (POLLO AL LATTE)
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ea Chicken, 2 1/2 lb
1 qt Milk
2 oz Butter
2 oz Ham or bacon
1 ea Onion
1 ea Clove garlic
6 ea Coriander seeds
1 x  A little basil or marjoram
1 x  Salt and pepper
Ask the butcher to split the chicken into two halves. Or just joint
the chicken as usual. . Rub the chicken with salt and pepper, and a
cut clove of garlic.  Melt the butter in a frying pan and brown the
chicken in it, together with the chopped onion, ham or bacon, and
finely chopped garlic. Lay the chicken pieces and the other
ingredients, including all the hot butter, in a casserole or other
fireproof dish. In a separate pan, heat the milk to boiling point,
with the coriander seeds and a pinch of basil or marjoram. Now pour
it, with the seeds and herbs, over the chicken. Add a pinch of salt
and black pepper. Bring the milk to simmering point again and keep
simmering, uncovered, at a moderate pace -- the milk should bubble
visibly but not fiercely -- for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Don't touch it
during this period, and you should see a golden skin forming over the
contents of the pot while the milk bubbles away underneath. At the
end of this time, stir the skin into the milk, together with any
crusty bits sticking to the sides of the pan.  The milk will have
reduced quite a bit now, and will be getting thick.  Continue
simmering for another 1/2 hour, till the sauce has reduced to a
cupful or so, watching carefully to see that it does not "catch" and
burn. . This dish can be eaten either hot or cold. If hot, serve the
chicken from the pan, as it is, with some of the thick sauce. Nice
with noodles and peas. If it is to be eaten cold, lay the chicken
pieces out flat on a plate amd coat them carefully with the remaining
sauce, before leaving them to cool.
