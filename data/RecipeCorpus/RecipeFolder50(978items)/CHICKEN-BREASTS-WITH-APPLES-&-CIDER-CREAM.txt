cool and pour into a wide mouth jar. Dredge chicken in combined
flour/salt/pepper. Heat 3 T oil in a large skillet. Add chicken and
saute on one side for about 5 minutes. Turn and saute for 3-5 minutes

into 1/4" slices. Remove chicken; keep warm. Add remaining 1 T oil to
pan. Add apple slices and saute for 3-5 minutes or until just tender.
Remove apples.  Add cider cream sauce to pan and heat while scraping
up any little browned bits from the pan bottom. Return chicken to
warm sauce for one minute, then top with apple rings and sauce. Heat
for one minute and serve. Can be held in slack oven or very low heat
for about 10-15 minutes.
