This is a hot, simple curry. Hike up the chiles for a vindaloo !!!
Watch out for the whole dried chiles though - they heat up the dish
slowly so don't adjust the chile level too soon (unless you're a
Chile-Head, in which case add a few more !!) A. Heat a little of the
oil in a large heavy frying pan then fry the chicken pieces over
moderate heat until they are sealed and have turned white. Remove
them from the pan and set aside B. heat the rest of the oil in a
heavy pan over a moderate heat C. add the whole dried chiles and fry
until they start to swell D. turn the heat to low and let the pan
cool a little then put in the chile powder, cumin and coriander and
fry for 10 seconds stirring all the time (do not burn or it will
taste bitter!) then quickly....... E. Put in the curry sauce, salt
and chicken pieces and cook for 30 minutes, stirring from time to
time F. 10 minutes from the end add the garam masala and fenugreek
leaves G. Simmer gently for the last 10 minutes stirring frequently
as the sauce should now be nice and thick
