Categories: Basics, Stock, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 4 Quarts
5 lb Chicken, parts, (backs,
-- necks, carcasses, and
-- giblets), (no livers)
2 lg Onions, coarsely chopped
2 md Carrots, peeled, trimmed
-- coarsely chopped
2 lg Celery, stalks, with leaves,

1 bn Parsley, stems
2    Thyme, sprigs, OR
1 pn Thyme, dried
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Salt, coarse
6    Peppercorns
Wash chicken parts well and place them in a large stockpot.  Add cold
water to cover by about 2 inches and slowly bring to a boil, skimming
all of the froth from the surface as it forms. Lower the heat and add
all of the remaining ingredients except the peppercorns.  Simmer,
uncovered, for 3 hours.  Add water as needed to cover the ingredients
and skim when necessary. Add peppercorns for the last fifteen minutes
of the simmering process. Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through
a colander lined with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently
press the solids to extract all of the liquid possible. Discard the
solids and cool the liquid to room temperature. Refrigerate until
chilled and lift off the solid fat that forms at the surface.
Discard the fats.  Pour the stock into containers for storage, label
and date.  Stock keeps for about 3 days in the refrigerator, and up
to six months in the freezer.
