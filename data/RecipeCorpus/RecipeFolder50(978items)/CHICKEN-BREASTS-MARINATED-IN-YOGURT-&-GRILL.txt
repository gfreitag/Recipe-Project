In a medium bowl, combine the marinade ingredients. Add the chicken
and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. In a bowl,
combine the lemon juice, lemon zest, vinegar, shallots, tarragon and
honey and mix with a hand blender. Slowly incorporate the olive oil
or stock, either by whisking by hand or pulsing 2 to 3 times with
hand blender. The vinaigrette should not be emulsified but remain
very light in body. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Store
covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Makes approximately
2    cups.

Preheat the broiler or stove top grill. Wipe any excess marinade from
the chicken. Grill or broil until the chicken is just done and juicy,
about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. While the chicken is cooking, heat
the olive oil in a large saute pan and quickly saute the savory
greens until just wilted. Serve the chicken on top of the greens and
drizzle with the vinaigrette to taste.
