MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Thick terracotta pots (chicken bricks or romertopf) especially for
baking chickens in can be bought now in many kitchen shops; they are
foolproof to use, and keep the oven clean.

Paint the bird all over with mustard and lay it in the bottom half of
the terracotta pot. Cut the peeled clove of garlic in half and rub it
over the inside of the pot. Rub the skin of the bird with salt and
pepper. Scatter the herbs over the bird, tucking some inside it. Pour
the olive oil over the chicken and close the pot.

Place in a cold oven, turn up the heat as high as it will go and
leave for 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Take the pot out of the oven and remove
the bird. Carve the chicken and arrange the pieces on a serving
platter. Strain the cooking juices from the pot, discarding the
herbs, and pour the juices over the carved chicken. Serve with rice
or noodles and a green salad.
