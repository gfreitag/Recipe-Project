Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Stalks lemon grass
1 c  Water
4 c  Coconut milk
8    Chicken thighs or
1 1/3 lb Chicken breast, diced
10 sl Galangal
2 tb Fish sauce
3 sm Fresh chilies
3    Bergamot leaves
2 tb Lemon juice
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
Spring onions, shredded
Chilies, shredded
This one's a bit more complex and gets into some exotic ingredients.
All of them should be available from an Asian grocery. If you have
any questions about what the ingredients are or how to use them, just
ask. The only thing that can not be substituted for is the fish
sauce. You could use ginger instead of galangal, but the soup would
lack the perfumed, exotic aroma of the galangal that adds so much to
the dish.

Lime zest could be used for the bergamot leaves.

Cut the lemon grass into 1-inch pieces.  Bring the water to the boil
with half the coconut milk.  Then add the chicken, lemon grass,
galangal and 1 tablespoon fish sauce.  Simmer for about 20 minutes or
until the chicken is cooked.  Less cooking time will be required for
diced chicken breast.

Stir in the remaining coconut milk and turn up the heat. As soon as it
begins to boil, toss in the whole chilies and bergamot leaves. Stir,
and remove from the heat.

Serve in individual bowls.  Sprinkle each with lemon juice and fish
sauce to taste and garnish with slivers of spring onions and chili.
