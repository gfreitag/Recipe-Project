Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
10    Small white onion, peeled
3    Cloves
1/3 ts Tarragon or thyme
4 tb Butter
4 tb Oil

Bring broth to a boil and add onion, one of which is stuck with
cloves and tarragon.  Simmer for 10 minutes, or until onions are soft.

Heat 2 tablespoons each butter and oil in a large skillet. Put 2
tablespoons flour, seasoned with salt and pepper, in a brown bag and
shake the chicken in it. Brown chicken well on both sides in the
skillet. Add the onions and broth, cover, and cook gently for
20    minutes.

In another pan, saute the mushrooms and garlic in the remaining
butter and oil. Add remaining flour, season, and stir to a smooth
paste. Add cream and stir until sauce is smooth.

Remove chicken and onions to a platter and keep warm. Combine the
chicken broth and cream sauce and heat, stirring constantly, until
smooth. Correct seasoning and pour sauce over chicken.

Note:  This can be made ahead of time and gently reheated, but keep
the chicken and sauce separate. Before serving, reheat chicken,
reheat sauce, then pour sauce over the chicken. Yield: 4 servings.
