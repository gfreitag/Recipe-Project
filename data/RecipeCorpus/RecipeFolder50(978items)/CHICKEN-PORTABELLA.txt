Title: CHICKEN PORTABELLA
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
16 oz Chicken thighs or breast;
-skinned and deboned
2 tb Olive oil
1    Shallot; finely chopped
2    Cloves garlic; finely chop'd
1/2    Green bell pepper; finely
-chopped
1 tb Lemon juice
6 oz Portobella mushrooms; cut
-into 1" chunks
1/4 c  Chicken stock
1/4 c  Wine
1 tb Tarragon; fresh chopped
1 tb Lovage; fresh chopped
Salt & pepper to taste
1 tb Arrowroot dissolved in wine
Preheat oven to 375F.

Divide chicken into 4 equal portions. Lightly salt and sear on both
sides in an oven proofed saut pan. Remove from pan and set aside.

Saut mushrooms lightly for 1-2 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.

Add shallots and garlic and saut for 1 minute. Add green pepper and
saut for 1-2 minutes. Deglaze pan by adding 1/4 c red, white or ros
wine (I personally prefer a ros with chicken). Allow to reduce by
1/2... add chicken stock and herbs. Return chicken to pan and place
in oven. After 10 minutes add portabella mushrooms on top. Cook
another 5-10 minutes or until done.

Remove chicken to serving platter or plates leaving mushrooms behind.
Add arrowroot dissolved in wine to thicken sauce. Add salt & pepper
to taste. Spoon over chicken and serve.
