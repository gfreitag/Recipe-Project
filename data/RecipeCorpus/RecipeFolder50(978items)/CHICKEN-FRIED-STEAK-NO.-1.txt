Categories: Main dish, Beef, American
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Round steak
2 ea Eggs
1 x  Salt & pepper
1 x  Flour
1 x  Meat tenderizer
~Cut the round steak into slightly small portions and beat with a
mallet or back of a knife until thin and all ratty looking. -Beat the
eggs with a little water. ~Mix the flour, salt, pepper, and about 1
1/2 t of tenderizer together. -Dredge the meat through the eggs and
then in the flour mixture. ~Fry on medium-high heat in oil and
butter. Be careful that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan too
bad. As you cook, sprinkle little bits of the flour mix in the pan so
that you get a lot of good drippings you'll use that for the gravy.
When the meat is cooked through, drain on paper towels while you make
the gravy. -Milk Gravy drain most all of the oil out of the pan, and
add about 1/2 stick of butter or marg. -Stir around good over medium
low heat to scrape all the drippings off the bottom of the pan.
~Sprinkle some more of the flour mix into the pan until you almost
have a roux. ~Add milk a little bit at a time, stirring real well
with a flat spatula to get it all mixed up. When desired consistency,
remove from heat and serve with the steak. -Try serving with
Black-eyed peas and lots of mashed potatoes or  rice.
YUMM!!!!
