Categories: Chicken, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Boneless, chicken breast
-halves
Salt
Pepper
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Dried thyme
2 tb White wine vinegar
1 c  Chicken broth
Generously season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Coat with
flour and shake off excess. Heat oil in a wide skillet (at least
10-inch diameter) over moderately high heat for about 1 minute. Add
chicken and brown well on one side, get it pretty dark. Flip the
chicken over and brown the other side. (Extra dark chicken makes a
more delicious sauce.) Each side should take about 4 minutes. While
the chicken cooks, prepare garlic. Remove chicken from skillet and
set aside. Add thyme, garlic and white wine vinegar to the skillet.
Stir to loosen whatever is stuck to the skillet. Add chicken broth,
turn heat to high and boil rapidly until the lquid is reduced to
about 1/4 cup. Pour over chicken and serve.
