Place chicken, water, leaves from celery and small onion in a large
saucepan.  (Reserve celery stalks.) Cover saucepan and bring to a
boil; reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours until chicken is tender.
Remove chicken. Strain broth into bowl; chill until fat sets on top.
Remove fat. Remove skin and bones from chicken, discard. Cut chicken
into bite-sized pieces, set aside.  (My note:  if you want less than
8 servings, freeze extra broth and chicken separately in meal-sized
portions.) Return broth to saucepan. Chop reserved celery stalks, add

seasonings. Cover and simmer 20 min. Add fresh green beans and
chicken; continue cooking 15 min or until beans are tender. Each
