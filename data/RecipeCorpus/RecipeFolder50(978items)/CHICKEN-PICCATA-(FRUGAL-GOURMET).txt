Recipe by: Pat Campbell <pcampbel@CCSMTP.REDSTONE.ARMY.MIL> Saut the
yellow onion, garlic and gr onions in the olive oil just until
tender. Remove from the pan and set aside. Remove skins and bones
from chicken breasts and pound them flat. Mix flour, salt and pepper
together and place in flat bowl.  Dip chicken into flour mixture,
lightly brown chicken in butter 2 or 3 minutes per side. Add the
sauted onions and garlic. Over high heat add sherry, lemon juice and
capers. This should thicken to make a nice gravy for chicken.

onion fan like myself
