Categories: Harned 1994, Herbs, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Fresh whole basil leaves
6    To 8 whole basil leaves
1    Garlic clove, peeled
-- finely chopped
3 tb Unsalted butter; room temp.
2    To 3 lb. roasting chicken
1    Whole lemon
Fresh ground pepper
Wash & pat dry the basil, reserving large whole leaves for the
roasting pan and for the chicken cavity.

Mince remaining basil.  In a small bowl, with a wooden mallet or
spoon (or using a mortar and pestle), blend minced basil, garlic and
butter. Chill until slightly firm (this can be prepared ahead of time
and refrigerated or frozen).  Have chicken at room temperature. Rinse
thoroughly and pat dry with paper towel.

With fingers, gently separate skin from meat, beginning at neck and
continuing down over breast. Separate skin through to the meaty
portion of the drumsticks. Place small bits of chilled basil butter
between breast and leg meat and skin, being careful not to tear skin.

Halve lemon, placing one piece in cavity of bird, along with 3 or 4
whole basil leaves.  Truss chicken with string to secure wings and
legs.

Place remaining basil on bottom of roasting pan; set chicken,
breast-side up, over top.  Drizzle with juice of remaining half lemon
and sprinkle with pepper to taste.

Roast in a preheated 375 F. oven for 25 minutes. Reduce heat to 350
degrees and roast another 30 to 35 minutes or until drumsticks move
easily in their sockets.  During this cooking period, baste
frequently with pan juices. Let chicken stand 10 minutes before
carving. Serve with defatted pan juices.

The author writes:  "If you have any leftovers from this tasty bird,
chop and use them for chicken salad, sprinkled with toasted almonds
or pine nuts."
