Title: CHICKEN SOPOPILLA (INCL. TORTILLAS)
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  All purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Baking powder
1 tb Shortening -- (lard is
Best)
3/4 c  Warm water
Oil for deep frying
Cooked, cut up or shredded
Chicken
(Pork is to die for!)
Salsa
1. Mix the flour, salt and baking powder together. Cut in the
shortening......Mix until it resembles cornmeal. 2. Stir in the water
until all the dough is moist. 3. Turn onto a floured surface and
knead about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap or towel and let rest
for 30 minutes. 4. Cut the batch in half and roll out about 1/4"
thick. (These are thicker than ordinary flour tortillas). 5. Cut into
4 to 5" squares or rounds. ( I like round so use a coffee can to cut)
6. Heat oil in a deep fryer or skillet to 400 degrees. (I just use a
deep iron skillet with about 3" of oil.) and drop, *one at a time in
the hot oil until puffed and golden brown (If they don't puff up, the
oil's not hot enough) 7. Take out ofskillet and lay on paper towels.
Continue until you have as many as you want. (*I own a huge black
iron skillet so I can make 3 at one time) Let cool a little. 8. Take
chicken or pork and mix with salsa. Heat chicken in salsa over stove
before you stuff. (I change all the time but generally make a Ancho
Chili Salsa) (E/mail for recipe.) 9. Carefully.......slit one side of
the Sopapilla and put in about 3 tablespoons of the chicken.

serve on a platter with each Sopapilla on a leaf of Romaine Lettuce
and Salsa Fresca on the side to put over/or in them. This is a last
minute, labor

intensive procedure........but they are simply wonderful
