Title: CHICKEN KABOBS WITH SPICY MANGO SAUCE
Categories: Poultry, Sauces
Yield: 24 Kabobs
2 tb Tamari or dark soy sauce
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Molasses
1 tb Cooking oil
2 ts Lime juice
2 ts Grated fresh ginger
4 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Dried red-pepper flakes
1/8 ts Salt
1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
Breasts, cut in 1/4" cubes
1    Mango, peeled and chopped
1 cl Garlic, minced
1/2 ts Minced Jalapeno pepper
3 tb Rice-wine vinegar or cider
Vinegar
1.  In a medium glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the ysmsri,
Worcestershire sauce, molasses, oil, lime juice, ginger, 1 teaspoon
of the sugar, the red-pepper flakes and salt. Add the chicken and
toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least an
hour.

2.  In a shallow dish, soak 24 six-inch wooden skewers in water for at
least 30 minutes.

3.  Make the dipping sauce.  In a medium stainless-steel sauce pan,
combine the mango, garlic, jalapeno, the remaining 3 teaspoons of
sugar and the vinegar and bring to a simmer over moderately low heat.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mango is soft, about 15
minutes. Transfer to a food processor or blender and pulse or blend
briefly to a coarse puree. Let cool.

4.  Heat the broiler.  Drain the chicken and thread 2 pieces onto each
skewer  Put the skewers on a baking sheet and broil, turning once,
until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes in all. Serve with
the dipping sauce.

(Note:  There is a trick to removing the flesh from a mango. Stand the
unpeeled mango on end and, using a sharp knife, slice down through
the skin and flesh, as close as possible to the pit, to remove the
flesh in one piece.  Repeat on the other side.  With the two pieces
skin-side down, score the flesh into cubes, taking care not to cut
through the skin. Turn the skin "inside out" and slice off the cubes
of fruit.)
