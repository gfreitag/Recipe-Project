Sausage slices until done, remove from pan. In the grease from the
sausages, with olive oil added as necessary, saute the garlic and
green peppers. When peppers are about 1/2 done, add the onion. Cook
until veggies are barely tender, still a trifle crisp, but not
browned. Remove from pan and add to sausages. Add more oil, saute
mushrooms until browned, remove and add to rest of the stuff. Last
step, saute the chicken until done. Add everything else back into the
pan, season generously with rosemary and oregano. Throwing a little
basil in won't hurt it either. If the dish seems dry, add small
amounts of either plain chicken broth or a broth & white wine mix. If
you've added too much liquid, then thicken it with cornstarch.
