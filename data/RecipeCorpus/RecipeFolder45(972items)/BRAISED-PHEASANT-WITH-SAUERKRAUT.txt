Title: BRAISED PHEASANT WITH SAUERKRAUT
Categories: Game, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Sauerkraut
2    Cup  Broth
8    Crunched juniper berries
4 tb Butter
1    Pheasant, singed and cleaned
3 tb Oil
1 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground pepper
Combine the sauerkraut with the broth and juniper berries, and simmer
1 hour, covered, in a large braising pan or Dutch oven. Heat the fat
in a heavy skillet and brown the pheasant on all sides over fairly
high heat. In case you want to cook 2 birds it is wiser to brown one
at a time. When they are nicely browned, salt and pepper them and
place in the braising pan on the sauerkraut. Cover and bake in a
375-degree oven 45 minutes, or until the pheasant is tender. Arrange
on a platter with the sauerkraut and serve with fried hominy squares.
