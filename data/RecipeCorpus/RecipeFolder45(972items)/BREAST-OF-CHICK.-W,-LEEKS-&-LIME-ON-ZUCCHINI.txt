*Sliced lengthwise and cut into spaghetti strips.

Pat zucchini "spaghetti" dry and toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive
oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside.

Lightly flour chicken breasts and shake off excess. Season with salt
and pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to an oven proof saute pan
and lightly brown on both sides. Remove from pan and set aside. Add
remaining oil, leeks and garlic and saute over moderate heat for 3 -
4 minutes or until vegetables are just beginning to soften. Add wine
and stock and cook over moderate heat for 3 - 4 minutes to reduce
liquid slightly.

Return chicken to pan and place some of the leeks mixture on top of
breasts. Season lightly and sprinkle lime zest, juice, parsley and
sundried tomatoes over and around breasts. Place pan uncovered in a
preheated 400 degree oven and bake for 5 - 7 minutes or until breasts
are just done.

Halfway through the baking of the breasts, place the zucchini on a
separate baking sheet and bake until zucchini just begins to soften.

To serve: Arrange zucchini attractively on warm plates and top with
breasts and vegetables. Drizzle pan juices over. Garnish with
zucchini flowers. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Yield: 8 serving
