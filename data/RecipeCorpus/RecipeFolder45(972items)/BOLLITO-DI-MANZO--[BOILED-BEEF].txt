~---------------- Beef brisket boiled with seasoning vegetables gives
you the extra benefit of the broth to use as needed. This broth
freezes very well.
~------------------------------------------------------
~------------------ Chop all vegetables quite coarsely. Put beef and
vegetables in a large pot ( a stock pot is ideal) with cold water to
cover. Bring to a boil slowly over medium-low heat.  As the water
boils, remove the froth that forms as much as possible. Lower heat to
simmer, cover the pot, and cook for 3 hours.  The meat will be very
tender and the broth a light brown. Remove meat from the pot and use
in any recipe that calls for boiled beef. Strain broth and use
immediately or freeze for future use.
