Categories: Muffins
Yield: 16 Muffins
2 oz Gingerroot, fresh, unpeeled
3/4 c  Sugar plus
3 tb Sugar
2 tb Lemon zest (from 2 lemons
-with some white pith)
8 tb Butter (1 stick), room temp
2    Eggs
1 c  Buttermilk
2 c  Flour, all purpose
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 ts Baking soda
Preheat oven to 375F.  Grease muffin tins.  Cut unpeeled ginger into
large chunks.  Process in food processor until ginger is in tiny
pieces. (You should have 1/4 cup. Better to have too much than too
little.) Put ginger and 1/4 cup sugar in small skillet and cook over
medium heat until sugar has melted and the mixture is hot. This only
takes a couple of minutes, don't leave unattended.  Remove ginger
mixture from stove and allow to cool. Put lemon zest and 3
tablespoons sugar in food processor and process until the lemon peel
is in small bits; or chop the lemon zest and pith by hand and then
add the sugar. Add the lemon mixture to the ginger. Stir and set
aside. Put the butter in a mixing bowl and beat a second or two, add
the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and beat until smooth. Add the eggs and
beat well.  Add the buttermilk and mix until blended. Add the flour,
salt and baking soda.  Beat until smooth.  Add the giner-lemon
mixture and mix well. Spoon the batter into the muffin tins so that
each cup is three-quarters full.  Bake 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve warm.
