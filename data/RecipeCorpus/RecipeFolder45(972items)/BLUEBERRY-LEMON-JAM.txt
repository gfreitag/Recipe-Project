4 1/2 c  Blueberries; fresh or frozen
7 c  Sugar
2 tb Lemon juice
Grated zest of 2 large lemon
3    3-oz pouches liquid pectin
Pick over the fresh blueberries to remove any stalks and rinse under
cold water. Drain well and place in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan.
(Do not rinse or thaw the frozen berries.) Crush the berries slightly
with a potato masher or pestle. Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, and
zest. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often. When the
mixture reaches a full boil, cook for 1 minute. Stir in the pectin.
Return to a full boil, then cook for another minute. Ladle into hot,
sterilized jars leaving 1/4 inch of headroom. Wipe the rims clean and
put the lids on top of the jars. Process in a boiling water bath for
about 5 minutes. Remove from the water and cool completely at room
temperature. Makes about 6 cups. Source: "An Edible Christmas (A
