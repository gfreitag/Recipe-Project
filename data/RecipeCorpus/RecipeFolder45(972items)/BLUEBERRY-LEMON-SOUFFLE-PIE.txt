Title: BLUEBERRY LEMON SOUFFLE PIE
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Blueberries, picked over
6 tb Granulated sugar
3 lg Eggs, separated
7 tb Superfine sugar
1/4 c  (plus 3 tb) fresh lemon
Juice
Grated zest of 2 lemons
1/8 ts Salt
1    Baked pie shell
Preheat oven to 400F.  In a nonreactive saucepan, toss the
blueberries and granulated sugar.  Cook over moderately high heat,
stirring occasionally, until the juices begin to bubble, 3-5 minutes;
do not overcook or the berries will burst.  Pour into a stainless
steel strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the drained juices. Using an
electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 4 tablespoons of the
superfine sugar until pale and thick, about 2 minutes.  Gradually
beat in the lemon juice and then the zest. Transfer the mixture to a
nonreactive saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring, until it
thickens, about 8 minutes; do not boil. Scrape into a bowl and set
aside on a rack to cool. Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites
until foamy. Add the salt and beat until soft peaks form. Add the
remaining 3 tablespoons superfine sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time,
beating well after each addition. Beat at high speed until the whites
are glossy but not dry, about 20 seconds longer. Using a rubber
spatula, stir one-fourth of the beaten whites into the yolk mixture.
Gently fold in the remaining whites in three additions. Spoon the
blueberries into the pie shell and drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons of the
drained juices over them.  Mound the souffle mixture over the
berries, touching the pie crust all around. Bake in the middle of the
oven for about 15 minutes, until the top is nicely browned. Transfer
the pie to a rack to cool slightly.  Serve at warm or at room
temperature.
