Title: BONELESS PORK LOIN
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Boneless pork loin
9    Cloves garlic
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Lime juice
4    Crushed chile peppers
1/2 c  Olive oil
Throw the marinade ingredients into a food processor, garlic and soy
first, until mixed then add the rest. Marinate at least overnight,
then fire up the grill using the indirect method. Put two or three
large chunks of Hickory on the coals when they are ready.

For an ~4 lb pork loin it will take ~ 3 - 4 hours, adding charcoal and
hickory as needed.

If you try this let me know how it turns out.
