Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1/3 c  Olive oil
2 md Onions, chopped
4    Cloves garlic, minced
2    Jalapeno peppers, chopped
1    Mild pepper, chopped
1    Red pepper, chopped
1    Green pepper, chopped
2 lg Tomatoes, diced
8 oz Tomato sauce
2 cn Rotel Tomatoes and Chilis
2    15-oz cans dark red kidney
Beans
3 c  Water
4 tb Chili powder
2 tb Cumin
1 tb Paprika
1 tb Oregano
1 tb Lemon juice
Salt, pepper to taste
Tabasco to taste
1 c  Textured Vegetable Protein
Saute onions, garlic, and peppers in oil until onions are
translucent. Add spices and simmer for two minutes. Stir in remaining
ingredients, adding the TVP last. You can adjust the amount of TVP to
obtain the desired texture and consistency. You can substitute beer
for the water for a more unique flavor. One jalapeno makes a mild
chili (two were used for the cookoff). Simmer from four to six hours.
It's even better the next day.

This was the Third Place Winner and Best of Show trophy winner at
