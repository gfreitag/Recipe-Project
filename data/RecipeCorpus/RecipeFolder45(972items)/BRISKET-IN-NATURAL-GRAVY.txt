This brisket is better if prepared a day ahead and refrigerated over
night; so that the congealed fat can easily be removed.The brisket
and strained juices should be reheated together... Preheat the oven
to 375 deg.Place the brisket together with the onions carrots,bay
leaves,garlic,salt and pepper,in heavy duty Dutch Oven or heavy
roasting pan with a tightly fitting cover.Add enough water to just
cover the meat.Cover tightly and cook in preheated oven for 2 1/2 to
3 hours,until the brisket is fork tender.Remove the brisket to a
platter.Strain the pan juices and discard the carrots and onions,or
save,and serve as a vegetable side dish.Reheat the pan juices in a
saucepan. Slice the brisket and serve the pan juices in a gravy
boat.Serve with kasha Varnishkes,or mashed potatoes.The left over
brisket makes wonderful sandwichs.
