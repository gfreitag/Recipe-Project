Also, baked Brie is fabulous.  If you want to get fancy with the brie,
saut# some mushrooms with tarragon, garlic and a bit of wine until the
mixture is almost dry (the mushrooms should be sliced or chopped, by
the by), take a wheel of brie, slice it in half, put the mushroom mix
in the middle, and wrap it in phyllo or puff pastry (the frozen puff
pastry works fine).  Put in the freezer for 20 minutes to firm
everything up.

At this point, it can be moved to the fridge and kept until needed.
Bake it in a moderate oven until the puff pastry browns. Let sit for
15-20 minutes before cutting.

You can also use puff pasty scraps to cut out little leaves and stuff
to put on top of the whole thing for decoration. This is best with
the small wheels, about
5    inches in diameter.
