This "housewife's" sauce can be made at the lat minute from
ingredients that are almost always in the refrigerator. Even a plain
piece of fish can become "company fare" when served with a Bonne
Femme Sauce. Make it with chicken stock and serve it over poached
eggs instead of Hollandaise, or pour it over steamed vegetables.

Salt And Freshly Ground White Pepper, To Taste

Beat the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl until light, then whisk in
the scalded cream.  Next, pour the boiling stock into the egg mixture
and beat in the butter. Season with salt and pepper and serve
immediately.

Yield:  About 2 1/2 cups of sauce.
