(They 'stuff' the Brie with 1/4 cup sliced, toasted almonds and
1/4 cup chopped parsley instead of Boursin)

* Boursin cheese is a spreadable garlic and herb cheese. Boursin
Poivre contains a lot of black pepper for those who like pepper.
Boursin is available in many grocery stores but can almost certainly
be found in higher quality produce and specialty stores. If Boursin
or Boursin Poivre cannot be found, Alouette can be used as a
substitute although it is not as high quality as Boursin, in my
opinion.
