Title: BRAISED WILD DUCK BREASTS IN A SPICED WINE SA
Categories: Poultry, Game, Casseroles, Jw
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Duck breasts; whole, with
-ribs and backs
4    Bacon strips
1 cl Garlic; finely minced
1 ts Dried parsley
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Marjoram
Salt
Freshly ground coarse
-Black pepper
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  Onion; coarsely chopped
10 oz Can mushrooms and juice
1/2 c  Sven's Glogg*
1/2 c  Chicken stock
* A spiced wine, which see, or sub red wine that has had a pinch each
orange peel, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and anise steeped in it.

Pre-heat oven to 400. Place the skinned breasts in a casserole. Lay 2
half strips of bacon over each breast. Sprinkle the seasonings over
the birds and then the onions and mushrooms. Pour the mushroom juice,
wine and a little stock over all and cover the casserole. Bake for 20
minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 and bake for a further 55
minutes.

This dish tastes even better if it is allowed to cool slowly with the
breasts marinading in the stock and re-heated the next day for
serving.

Alternatively the cold cooked breasts can be boned; the stock
thickened with cornstarch or flour and the breast medallions heated
briefly in the simmering gravy and served on toast.
