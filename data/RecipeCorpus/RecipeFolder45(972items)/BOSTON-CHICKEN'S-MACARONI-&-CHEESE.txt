Cook al dente --  drain
2/3 c  Milk (2% or regular)
1 lb Velveeta cheese -- light or
Cubed small
1/4 ts Dry mustard powder
1/2 ts Ground turmeric
Salt and pepper to taste
Place into top of double boiler over gently simmering water milk,
cheese, mustard powderm turmeric, salt and pepper in that order. Stir
with whisk occasionally until melted and smooth. Stir pasta into hot
cheese mixture and keep hot until serving time over hot water, up to
an hour. (If it begins to thicken up too much, dilute with a little
milk). Neverput into oven or over direct heat as it will scorch and
change the texture to a sticky mess. 6-8 side servings or 4 main-dish
servings. Source Gloria Pitzer.
