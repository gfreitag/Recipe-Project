When you open the can of carrots, run the blade of a paring knife
through them right in the can so that you've reduced them to tiny
bits without mashing them. Empty it then intoa Dutch oven. Add the
mushrooms; set aside. Empty the  cam of broth into the blender and
add the celery along with the sage,  poultry seasoning, bouillon
powder and margarine. Blend a few seconds on high speed, only until
celery is finely minced. Meanwhile, add the English muffin cubes,
(crumbs too), croutons, parsley and onion to the Dutch oven. Pour
blender mixture over and stir to combine with rubber bowl scraper
until completely moist. Cover with a lid and bake at 350~ about 45
minutes to an hour or until piping hot. Refrigerate leftovers to use
within a week. Freeze to use within 4 months. Source: Ask Your
