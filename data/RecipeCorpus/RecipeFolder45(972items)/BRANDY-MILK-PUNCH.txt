Title: BRANDY MILK PUNCH
Categories: Beverages, Dairy, Creole, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Batch
2 ts Sugar, confectioners
1 tb Creme de cacao, white
3/4 c  Whipping cream
1 1/2 oz Brandy
1/2 c  Ice, crushed
1 ds Nutmeg
Place sugar, creme de cocoa, cream and brandy in a cocktail shaker
with crushed ice (regular cubes are fine, too). Shake briefly (longer
if using cubes) and strain into an old fashioned glass. Garnish with
nutmeg.

These also look great when served in wine glasses that have been
chilled first in the freezer!
