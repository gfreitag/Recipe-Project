Title: BOBBIE'S MUSHROOM & SPINACH FAJITAS
Categories: Low fat, Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
2 tb Olive Oil
2 Portabello Mushrooms, sliced 8-10 Button Mushrooms, sliced 1 green
pepper, sliced in strips 3 green onions, chopped, green ends too 2
cloves garlic, minced 2 stalks celery, chopped 2 t. Chili powder 1 T.
dried parsley, or fresh cilantro Bunch of spinach, whole leaves if
stems are tender, or rip leaf from stalks Tortillas Salsa, Guacamole,
Sour Cream

In frying pan with lid, saute garlic, onion, celery in olive oil until
almost tender. Add mushrooms, green pepper and saute a little longer.
Add 2 T. water, cover and cook a few minutes. Add chili powder, and
parsley, or fresh cilantro to taste if you have it. Add spinach,
replace cover, and turn off heat. While mixture is sitting. Warm
tortillas. I warm tortillas a couple at a time by placing them on a
small plate covered with a wet paper towel for 30 seconds in the
microwave. Scoop mixture onto warm tortilla. Add salsa, guacamole,
sour cream, if you have them. I used Salsa, trying to keep it as
low-fat as possible. Eat and enjoy!
