Title: BOXWALLAH'S CHUTNEY
Categories: Relishes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight
1 lb Onions
1/2 lb Raisins
1/2 lb Sultanas
1/2 oz Coriander seeds
2 ts Curry powder
6 oz Granulated sugar
3/4 pt Raspberry vinegar
-OR- red wine vinegar
Cut the trimmed rhubarb into short lenghths and chop the onions quite
finely.  Put both ingredients into a large pan and pour on the
vinegar. Then lightly bruise the whole coriander seeds. Add the seeds
direct to the pan if you want to include them in the chutney.  I love
their spicy bite but some people complain that the seeds stick
between their teeth, so you may prefer to tie them in a piece of
buttermuslin and remove before potting.  Bring the contents of the
pan slowly to boiling point, cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes
or so to start softening the onion.

Add the dried fruits, sugar, curry powder and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Stir to mix well.  Then continue simmering - this time without a lid
~ for 1 1/2 hours or so until the rhubarb has pulped down completely,
the flavour is mellow, and the colour is rich and the consistency is
thick. Stir the chutney occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking,
particularly towards the end. Pot in warm sterilised jars and allow
to mature for at least one month before eating.  The longer you can
resist eating this chutney the better it seems to taste.
