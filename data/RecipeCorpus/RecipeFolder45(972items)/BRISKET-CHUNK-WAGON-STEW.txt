Yield: 1 Recipe
2 tb Bacon grease or

3 lb Beef brisket, fat
-trimmed and cut into
1 1/2    In cubes
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper, freshly
-ground
1 lg Onion, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
4 c  Beef stock (preferably
-homemade or canned
Low-sodium broth)
2 cn (4 oz ea) chopped mild
-green chilies, drained
2 lb Red-skinned potatoes,
-scrubbed and cut into
1    In pieces
2 c  Fresh or thawed frozen
-corn kernels
1/4 c  Fresh cilantro
-(coriander) or parsley,
-chopped
1 c  Flour
In a large flameproof casserole or Dutch oven, heat the bacon grease
over medium heat.  Season the beef brisket with salt and pepper.
Working in batches to avoid crowding, add the brisket and cook,
turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.
Transfer the brisket to a plate.

Add the onion and garlic to the casserole and cook, stirring often,
until the onion is softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the beef stock.
Return the brisket to the pot and add the chilies. Bring to a simmer
over high heat, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface.
Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the brisket is tender,
about 2-1/2 hours.

During the last 30 minutes, stir in the potatoes, corn, and cilantro.
Remove from the heat and let stand 5 minutes. Skim any fat from the
top of the stew. (It's easier to remove the fat if the stew is cooled
to room temperature, covered and refrigerated overnight. Discard
hardened fat from surface.  Reheat gently over low heat before
proceeding.)

In a small bowl, whisk 1 cup of the cooking liquid with the flour
until smooth.  Stir into the stew and simmer until the sauce is
thickened, about 3 minutes. Season the stew with additional salt and
pepper; serve hot. Freezes and reheats well.

Makes 8 servings.
