Title: BRINED JERKY
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
5 lb Lean meat
1 c  Curing salt
1/2 c  Brown suger or molasses
1 ts Liquid garlic
4 tb Black pepper
2 qt Water
Remove all fat and membrane from the meat.  Combine the rest of the
ingredients.  Soak the meat in the solution (brining the meat) for 8
to 10 hours. Remove meat and rinse thoroughly. Pat dry with paper
towels to remove excess moisture. Let stand to air-dry for an hour or
so. Then rub in the seasonings of your choice, such as onion salt,
garlic salt, pepper or a prepared seasoning mix from the spice
department at the market. Smoke meat for 8 to 12 hours or until
ready. Test the meat by twisting a strip of meat.  It should be
flexible but stiff like a piece of rope. Remove and let stand until
cool.
