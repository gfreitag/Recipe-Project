1 1/2 lb Bok Choy -- fresh as
Possible
1/3 c  Salad Oil

Cut any bok choy that are thicker than 3 inches in half lengthwise;
leave smaller ones whole.  Arrange as many boy choy on a steaming
rack as will fit without crowding. Steam until stocks begin to turn
translucent and are soft when pierced (4 to 5 minutes). Lift out and
plunge into cold water; when cool, drain well and place in a shallow
dish. Repeat with remaining bok choy. Stir together oil, vinegar,
mustard, soy, garlic, ginger, and sugar. Pour over bok choy.  Makes 6
to 8 servings.
