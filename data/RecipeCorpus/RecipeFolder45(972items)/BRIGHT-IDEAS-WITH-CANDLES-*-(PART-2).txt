5). Candle arrangements in unusual containers can be creatively
unique. Use items you have around your home. Try votive candles in
fluted molds, saucer type champagne glasses, muffin pans or on
inverted clay flower pots in clay saucers; surround with brightly
colored ribbons, jingle bells, small shiny tree ornaments or pine
cones. Florist clay or candles "stickem" can be used to secure the
candles.
6). Winter wonderland: Candles can be used to create an illusion of
moonlight on snow covered boughs. Place white or ivory candles of
various heights in glass holders. Group and surround them with
snow-flocked evergreens. Intertwine metalic colored ribbons around
candle holders. Use crystal angles or trees for a touch of fantasy.
For a doubly beautiful effect, arrange grouping on a mirrored
background to catch and reflect the light.
7). Paper-Bag Luminaries: Can be made using small paper bags, plain
or colored, sand and votive candles. Bags can be decorated by cutting
out holes with scissors or paper punches, but make sure they are
small so that the wind cannot put the candles out. Fold top of each
bag down about 2" for added strength. Put about 2" of sand in each
bag. Place candle in the center of the bag, making sure it does not
touch edges; light the candle. Place 3-6' apart on edge of sidewalks,
driveways and steps. Do not place near dry leaves or shrubbery.
