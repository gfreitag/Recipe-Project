Make the dough:  In a bowl stir together the flour, the sugar, and a
pinch of salt, add the butter and blend the mixture until it
resembles coarse meal.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons cold water, toss the
mixture until the water is incorporated, and form the dough into a
ball. (The dough will be slightly soft.)  With well floured hands
press the dough evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch
tart pan with a removable fluted rim.

Make the filling:  In a large bowl stir together the sugar, the
flour, the cinnamon, and the nutmeg, add the blueberries, and toss
the mixture lightly.

Pour the blueberry filling into the shell, distributing it evenly,
and bake the tart in the middle of a preheated 400 degree F oven for
50 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the shell is golden
brown. Let the tart cool on a rack for 5 minutes, arrange the
blueberries evenly over the filling and let the tart cool completely.
Serve the tart with the vanilla ice cream if desired.
