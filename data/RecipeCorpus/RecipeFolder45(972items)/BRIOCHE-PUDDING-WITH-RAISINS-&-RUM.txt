Title: BRIOCHE PUDDING WITH RAISINS & RUM
Categories: New, Text, Import
2/3 c  golden or dark raisins
Yield: 4 Servings
3 TB dark rum
1    brioche loaf (recipe
follows), -- halved
:
1    stick (4 ounces) unsalted
butter
:
2 c  milk
2 c  heavy cream
3/4 c  sugar
1    vanilla bean, -- halved
8 lg eggs

The day before, if possible, bring raisins to a boil in a pan of
water and drain. Place plumped raisins in a plastic container that
has a tight-fitting cover and sprinkle with the rum.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Melt the butter and cool it slightly.

Cut half the brioche loaf into thin slices. Cut remaining brioche in
1/2-inch dice.

Butter a 2 quart baking dish and add diced brioche. Strew with the
raisins and half the butter. Dip one side of each remaining slice of
brioche into the butter and arrange the bread, buttered side up and
slightly overlapping on top of diced brioche and raisins.

Combine the milk, cream, sugar and vanilla bean in a saucepan. Bring
the mixture to a boil over medium heat.

Whisk the eggs until liquid in a large mixing bowl, then strain the
milk mixture and whisk it into the eggs. Do not overbeat or the
custard will have a great deal of foam on the surface. Strain the
custard back into the pan and skim the foam from the surface with a
large spoon. Pour the custard over the brioche slices in the dish,
pouring so that the bread is evenly soaked and rises to the surface.

Place the baking dish in another larger pan and pour warm water into
the pan to come halfway up the side of the baking dish. Bake the
bread pudding for about 45 minutes, until the custard is set and the
brioche is an even golden color.
