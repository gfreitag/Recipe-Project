Yield: 8 Servings

2 md Onions
1 sm Celery knob
1 ts Salt
2 ea Bay leaves
5 ea Peppercorns, black
1 tb Butter, unsalted
1 tb Flour, all-purpose

1/4 c  Sour cream
Peel vegetables and cut into small pieces, and together with salt,
bay leaves and peppercorns cook them in 2 qts water till they are
almost soft.
Make a roux with butter and flour, cook for only a few minutes,
leaving it very light. Add paprika and whip 1/2 cup cold water into
the roux.
Pour roux into the vegetable mixture and bring again to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer.
Add fish pieces and fish head, and simmer soup for 10 minutes. Add
spawn and cook for another 5 minutes.
Pour in the vinegar; just before serving stir in the sour cream.
Adjust salt and vinegar to your taste.
Note: During Lent most Hungarians eat a lot of fish. There are
almost always little bits of fish meat, bones and heads left over and
that's when this soup would be a good beginning for a Lenten meal.
