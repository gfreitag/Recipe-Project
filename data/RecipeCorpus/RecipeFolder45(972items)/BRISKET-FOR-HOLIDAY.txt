Here's a recipe that I use all the time it is easy and tastes great!
Rub brisket with onion, celery, garlic salt and MSG, let stand for
about 30 minutes.  Place in a roaster and pour worchestire sauce and
liquid smoke over surface of roast. Cover and refrigerate several
hours. Drain off marinade, wrap brisket, fatty side up, in heavy duty
aluminum foil and seal.  Bake 5 hours @ 300. Allow to cool. Slice
