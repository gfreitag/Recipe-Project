Title: BOURBON MARINATING OR BASTING SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Lard
2 tb Hot red chili powder
2 tb Mild red chili powder
1    Onion -- finely chopped
1 tb Minced garlic
14 oz Tomato puree
1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Yellow mustard
1/2 c  Brown sugar -- firmly
Packed
1/4 c  Bourbon
3 dr Liquid smoke
Place the lard in a large, non reactive saucepan and saute the onion
and garlic until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining
ingredients and continue cooking for about another 30 minutes. Stir
frequently to prevent sauce from burning. Allow to rest for at least
an hour before using.

This is a marinating or basting sauce. To marinate, coat the meat
with the sauce and leave in the refrigerator, covered, over night, or
about 8 to 12 hours. Continue to baste with the sauce as the meat
cooks. It's NOT a table sauce, but works best when cooked into the
meat. Best with pork or beef.

Makes about 2 cups.
