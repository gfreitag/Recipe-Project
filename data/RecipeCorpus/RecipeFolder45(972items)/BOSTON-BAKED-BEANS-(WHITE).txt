This recipe, adapted from "Jasper White's Cooking From New England"
(Harper & Row; 1989), may well be the ultimate American baked bean,
just sweet enough from molasses and maple sugar.

Pick through beans and discard off-colored or broken ones. Rinse and
drain beans.

Remove rind from half of salt pork. Cut into 1/2" squares. Cut other
half into 3/4- to 1" thick strips to equal 4 or 5 strips, with rind
attached. Set aside.

Line bottom of earthenware crock or bean pot with 1/2" squares of
salt pork and onion. Place beans on top.

Bring 1 quart water to boil in saucepan. Add garlic, tomato puree,
salt, pepper, mustard, maple sugar, molasses, bay leaves and vinegar.
Simmer 1 minute. Mix well and pour over beans.

Score strips of salt pork crosswise, about every inch, without cutting
through. This prevents strips from curling while cooking. Place
strips on top of beans and liquid. Cover pot and bake at 250'F. 5
hours, checking occasionally (first at 2 hours, then every hour), to
be sure liquid is just barely covering beans. Add more water as
needed.

After 5 hours, remove cover of bean pot and cook 1 hour more. Remove
strips of salt pork and stir pot before serving. Makes 6-8 servings.
