Yield: 2 Servings
MMMMM---------------------ED BOSMAN MKPN54A--------------------------
2 1/2 c  BREAD flour
1/2 ts -Salt
3/4 ts Active dry yeast
1 c  -Warm water
2 sm Cloves garlic; thinly sliced
2 tb Rosemary*
3 tb Bertolli Light olive oil
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine flour, salt, yeast and water in
bowl. Blend well, turn out onto floured surface. Knead well, about 15
minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl, not buttered, cover with a
damp cloth and let rise for 1-1/2 hours (until doubled in bulk). Turn
dough out, punch down and knead for 5 minutes or so. Return to bowl
and let rise until doubled in bulk.  Punch down and turn out on
lightly floured board. Roll and press out to about 1/2 inch
thickness. This recipe makes about 1-12 inchers-so you can judge
whether to double or reduce the recipe. Rub surface of baking
(cookie) sheet with oil and transfer the dough round to the sheet.
Make several indentations with the point of a knife in the dough and
insert garlic slices and rosemary into indentations.Rub olive oil
(pour) onto surface and gently smooth over the surface. Salt and
pepper surface LIGHTLY.  Bake 10-12 minutes or until just golden.
Remove from oven and TAKE OUT THE GARLIC SLIVERS! You can now top the
crust, freeze it, eat it the way it is, smille at it (YOU DID IT!)
Remember, when you top it the crust is alread 2/3 baked and will
require only enough time so that the cheeses, etc. are bubbly.
