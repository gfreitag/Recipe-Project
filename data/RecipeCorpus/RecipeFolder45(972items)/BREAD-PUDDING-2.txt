Title: BREAD PUDDING 2
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
6 c  Bread, torn into pieces
1/2 c  Raisins
1 c  Brown sugar
4 c  Whole or 2%milk
3    Eggs, beaten
1 ts Vanilla
Put it all into a greased pan after mixing. Sprinkle 2 Tbs. of
margerine or butter on top.  Add more if desired. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp.
of nutmeg on top.

Bake 45 minutes.

Must be a 350-375 oven, just guessing as I don't have it in my book.

This recipe tastes very much like other delicious bread puddings I've
had.
