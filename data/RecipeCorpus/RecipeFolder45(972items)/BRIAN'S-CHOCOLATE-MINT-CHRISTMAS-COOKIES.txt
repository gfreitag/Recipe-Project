Vicki's notes:

*  Can substitute 3 oz. semi-sweet chips for the chocolate.

*  These cookies came about when my husband asked me to make
chocolate-mint cookies for Christmas.  (They are based on the
refrigerator cookies in "Joy of Cooking," with my own variations.)
Although disappointed because he really wanted Girl Scout cookies
(!), everybody else likes them and I've had several requests for the
recipe. (Actually, my husband usually asks for chocolate chip
cookies, no matter what time of year...)
