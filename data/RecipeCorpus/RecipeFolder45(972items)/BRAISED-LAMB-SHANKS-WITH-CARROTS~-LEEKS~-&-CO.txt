To Prepare the lamb: Preheat the oven to 350F. Trim the root ends and
cut the tops off the leeks, leaving an 8" length. Split the leeks in
half through the root end, cutting 6" toward the top. Rinse well to
remove any dirt from between the leaves. Trim the shanks of all
excess fat and season liberally with salt and pepper. In a large
saute pan or skillet over high heat, heat the oil and saute the
shanks until they are evenly browned all over, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour
off any excess fat from the pan.

Add the carrots, leeks, garlic, and ginger to the pan and continue to
cook for 5 minutes. Add the wine, stock, coriander seeds, tomato
paste, marjoram, and orange, and bring the liquid to a boil. Cover
and bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is very tender and
falling off the bone. Remove the pan from the oven, arrange the lamb
and veggies on a warm serving platter, and place the pan over medium
heat. Add the couscous to the juices and stir until the couscous
slightly thickens the sauce. Ladle some of the sauce over the meat
and veggies, and garnish the platter with the parsley and marjoram
sprigs.
