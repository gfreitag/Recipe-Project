Pit, skin, and slice the peaches.  Place them in a large pan with
enough water to prevent sticking and cook 15 to 20 minutes or until
soft. Puree the peaches in a food processor and return to the
saucepan, adding the brandy, lemon, sugar, and mint sprigs.  Simmer
over low heat, stirring frequently, 30 to 35 minutes or until the
puree thickens. Remove the mint and fill clean 1/2-pint jars with
peach butter to within 1/4-inch of the top.  Wipe, seal, and process
in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.
