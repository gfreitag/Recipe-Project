Title: BOBALKY
Categories: Ethnic, Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Butter
1 pk Yeast
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Water, lukewarm
2 1/2 ts Salt
7 c  Flour, all purpose, sifted
2 c  Milk, scalded
Into a mixing bowl, place butter, sugar, and salt. Add scalded milk;
let cool until lukewarm. Add yeast dissolved in water. Add enough
flour to make a soft elastic dough. Turn onto a floured board and
knead. Place in a greased bowl and let rise until double in bulk (1
to 1 1/2 hours) in a warm place, free from drafts. Punch dough down
with fingertips and let rise again (about 45 minutes). Toss lightly
on floured board, knead, and shape into a roll (like a pipe) about
1/2 inch in diameter. Place on cookie sheet. Cut with edge of
teaspoon into small pieces and let rise for 10 minutes. Bake at 375-F
for 15 minutes or until lightly brown. When cool, break and place in
collander. Pour boiling water over bobalky. Place on serving dish,
mix with poppy seed and melted butter, and serve.
Poppy seed (1/2 cup) should be ground and cooked in 3/4 cup
water for 10 minutes. Boil 3 cups milk and 1 cup sugar and mix with
poppy seed.
Instead of using sugar in poppy seed mixture, honey may be used,
poured over the bobalky.
If your family is small, divide the above dough into two
portions, bake bobalky from one portion, and a loaf of bread from the
other.
