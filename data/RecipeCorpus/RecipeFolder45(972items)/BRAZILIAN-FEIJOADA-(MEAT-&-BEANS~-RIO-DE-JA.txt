The evening before, rinse the salted meats in cold water and leave
them to soak overnight. The next morning, change the water and allow
them to continue soaking until you are ready to cook. Place all of
the ingredients in a large heavy pot and bring slowly to a boil over
medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 hours.
Remove each piece of meat when it is fork tender, starting with the
beef and ending with the smoked meats. Continue to cook the beans for
an additional 30 minutes, or until the liquid has become thick and
creamy. Meanwhile, remove the meat from the bones and cube or slice
what you can. When the beans are done, place them in a large, heavy
saucepan, add the meats, and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat and serve hot. Heap meats on one platter, put
beans in a clay pot, and white rice in another serving dish. The
garnishes must include peeled orange segments, fried manioca meal
(Farofa) julienned fried kale (Couve 'a Mineira), Pimenta & Lemon
