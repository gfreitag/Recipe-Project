MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FROSTING---------------------------
1 pk Instant low-cal pudding
.any flavor you like (small)
1/4 c  Powdered sugar

1    8 oz container low-cal non-

For the Cake: Separate eggs and put in two different bowls. Beat the
egg yolks with a third of the sugar until it is yellow and creamy.
Beat the egg whites until very stiff, and then beat in the rest of
the sugar. Sieve the four over the egg yolk mixture and then put the
egg snow on top. Fold gently. Line a springform pan with waxed paper
and grease the paper with some margarine, bottom only. Fill with the
mixture and bake at 350F for 20-30 minutes, or until a toothpick
comes out clean. Let cool a little, open the springform, invert the
cake on a platter and take off the waxed paper carefully. When cake
is completely cooled, cut gently in half. FOR THE PUDDING FROSTING:
Combine pudding with milk and sugar in a small bowl, and beat slowly
until well blended, about one minute. Fold in the non-dairy whipped
topping. Cool in the refrigerator until nice and cool and stiff. Fill
the middle of the cake, with a third and put the top of the cake on.
Spread the rest all over as regular frosting. Heap up little mounds
on the rim if it is a birthday cake and decorate with candies or
chocolate or anything you would on a regular frosted cake. Put cake
in the refrigerator over night. Makes a light, fresh cake even
children love and you can add some cocoa to the cake mix to have a
dark cake and frost with vanilla pudding or pecan.
