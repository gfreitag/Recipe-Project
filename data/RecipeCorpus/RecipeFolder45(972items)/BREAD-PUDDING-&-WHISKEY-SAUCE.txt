Recipe by: BENJAMIN STRONG (WWGQ25B) This is a classic New Orleans
dessert and a favorite of many. There are numerous versions - almost
every good Creole cook has her own. My wife developed this one after
many years of experimenting. I do NOT think that you will be
disappointed! This recipe will serve ten to twelve people - with
seconds.

Cover the raisins with the bourbon and let them soak overnight. Cube
the bread in about 5/8 inch cubes. You will need 8 to 9 cups. In a
large bowl combine bread and milk and let stand at room temperature
until bread is very soft. In another bowl beat 5 eggs and 2 cups
sugar and 3 Tbsp. melted butter. Stir this into the bread mixture.
Drain raisins, reserving bourbon for sauce. Add raisins and vanilla
to the bread mixture and stir well until mixed. Melt remaining 3
Tbsp. butter in a 9" x13" pan. Pour the pudding into the pan. Bake in
a 350 degree oven until puffed and golden brown. This should take
about 1 1/2 hours.

For the sauce, cream 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar. Beat in 2 eggs,
one at a time. Transfer to the top of a double boiler set over
simmering water. Stir in about 1/3 cup bourbon whiskey and additional
if required. You might want to experiment with the amount. Cook the
sauce, stirring, until it is thickened slightly. Serve warm sauce
over warm bread pudding. Note - we have found both pudding and sauce
can be frozen.

Adjust bourbon, which should be a very good straight bourbon, to your
taste. We use LOTS! Jack Daniels is NOT a bourbon and, IMHO, is not a
good choice. We use Fitzgerald.JM.
