Title: BRANDIED PEACHES
Categories: Penndutch, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Peaches (peck)
1 qt Brandy
1 x  Sugar
Skin peaches by pouring boiling water over a few at a time and
allowing to stand a few minutes. Then dip in cold water and skins
will rub off. After peaches have been skinned, measure them and use
one half of their weight in sugar. Have a large, clean, covered stone
crock and put in a layer of peaches and a layer of sugar until all
ingredients are used. Pour the brandy over the layers. Cover the
crock with a heavy piece of white muslin before placing on the top of
the crock. Set aside in a cool place and allow peaches to stand 2 to
3 months before using. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine
