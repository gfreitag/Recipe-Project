Title: BOOZEY RICH EGGNOG FROM A COOKED BASE
Categories: Alcohol, Holiday
Yield: 25 Servings
1 qt Milk
1    Vanilla bean OR 1 tb extract
12    Egg yolks
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Dark rum
2 c  Bourbon
1 c  Cognac or other brandy
8    Egg whites
3 tb Sugar
1 qt Cream
Freshly grated nutmeg
FOR BASE: In a heavy medium-sized saucepan, barely boil the milk with
the vanilla bean, which has beens split lengthwise, scraped with the
back edge of a knife and added to the milk--seeds, pod, and all (if
using vanilla extract, you'll add it after eggnog base has cooked).

Meanwhile, place a large fine-mesh strainer over a bowl set in a
large bowl of ice.

Beat the yolks and sugar together in the top of a double boiler, by
hand or with electric beaters, until thick and smooth, about 1
minute. Whisk in the hot vanilla milk. Cook in the double boiler set
over simmering water, stirring constantly all around the bottom and
corners with a rubber or wooden spatula. In time, foam will subside.
The eggnog base is done when it coats a wooden spoon without bare
spots, 12 to 15 minutes.

Immediately pour through strainer, stirring to cool. When cool to the
touch, slowly whisk in all liquors (if using vanilla extract instead
of vanilla bean, add this now, too). Store eggnog base in refrigerator
overnight or up to three days, to ripen.

TO COMPLETE EGGNOG: At serving, remove vanilla bean and pour eggnog
base into a large punch bowl.

Beat egg whites with 3 tablespoons sugar to stiff peaks; fold into
eggnog mixture. Beat cream to stiff peaks and fold it in, too. Let
some lumps of the cream and egg whites float on surface. Sprinkle
with nutmeg. Serve immediately, using a ladle.
