Preperation: Combine filling ingredients in a bowl; mix well. Set
aside for 30 minutes. Combine sauce ingredients in a bowl and set
aside. Peel cucumbers if desired.  Cut cucumbers crosswise into
1-inch thick sections; remove center of each section. Spoon about 1
level tablespoon of filling into each section.  Lightly coat with
cornstarch, shaking off excess. Set aside. Cooking: Set wok in a ring
stand and add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2 inches. Place over high
heat until oil reaches 360 to 375 degrees F. Add cucumber sections, a
few at a time, and deep fry for 2 minutes. Lift out and drain on
paper towels.  Cook remaining cucumber. Place fried cucumber sections
in a wide frying pan with a nonstick finish. Pour in sauce and bring
to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes. Add
corn starch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and
thickens. Arrange on a serving platter and serve hot. Serves 4 as a
Main dish, but also makes a nice hors d'oeuvre for more.
