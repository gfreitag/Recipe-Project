Title: BRANDIED CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES
Categories: Candies
Yield: 26 Truffles
3/4 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 lb Bittersweet chocolate
-OR- semisweet chocolate
-- Chopped
2 tb Cognac or other brandy
3/4 lb Bittersweet chocolate
-OR- semisweet chocolate
-- chopped
Bring whipping cream and unsalted butter to simmer in heavy medium
saucepan.  Reduce heat to low.  Add 1/2 pound bittersweet chocolate
and stir until melted. Mix in 2 tablespoons Cognac. Let stand at room
temperature until firm enough to mound on spoon, about
3-1/2    hours.

Line cookie sheet with foil.  Spoon truffle mixture by rounded
tablespoons onto prepared cookie sheet, spacing apart. Chill until
firm, about 1 hour.

Roll 1 truffle between palms of hands into ball. Place on same sheet.
Repeat with remaining truffles; refrigerate. Melt 3/4 pound chocolate
in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently
until smooth.  Remove from over water. Grasp 1 truffle between thumb
and index finger.  Dip into chocolate, coating completely. Shake
gently to remove excess chocolate.  Place on same sheet.  Repeat
dipping with remaining truffles.  Refrigerate until firm, about 30
minutes. Remove truffles from foil. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.
Refrigerate in airtight container.) Serve cold.
