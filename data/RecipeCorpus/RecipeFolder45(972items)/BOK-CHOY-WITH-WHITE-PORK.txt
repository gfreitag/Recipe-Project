Title: BOK CHOY WITH WHITE PORK
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 lb Boneless pork shoulder
1 lb Bok choy stalks
1/2 ts Minced garlic
1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
3 tb Peanut oil
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Chicken stock
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Dry sherry
Cornstarch paste
1 ts MSG (opt)
Slice pork against the grain into thin strips about 2" by 1/2".
Seperate outer fleshy stalks from center flower stalk of bok choy.
Use center stalk in another stir-fry dish or in soup. Wash outer
stalks, and diagonally slice into 3" pieces.  The meatier ends of the
stalks should be sliced a little thinner.

Swirl oil around in very hot wok.  When oil begins to smoke, add pork
and stir-fry until meat is seared (about 1 minute). Add bok choy,
garlic and ginger. Stir-fry until green leaves are bright and
shrivelled, stirring and tossing constantly so stalks won't burn. Add
salt, stock, sugar and dry sherry.

When liquid begins to boil, cover wok and steam for 30 seconds or
less on high heat, until stalks are tender but still crisp. Push
ingredients up side of wok; dribble cornstarch paste into liquid and
stir to make a light sauce.  Recombine and add MSG.  Serve
immediately.
