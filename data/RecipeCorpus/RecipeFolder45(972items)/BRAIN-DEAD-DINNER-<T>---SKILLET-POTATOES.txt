Title: BRAIN DEAD DINNER <T> - SKILLET POTATOES
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2    Bag Cascadian country style
Potatoes (frozen mix of
Potatoes,
Peppers, and onions)
1 ea Apple juice (small amount)
3 sl Yves Canadian Bacon (veggie
& nonfat),
1 pk Hain fatfree gravy mix
Chop up the Canadian Bacon slices into bite size pieces.

Heat apple juice in nonstick skillet.  Add enough potatoes to more or
less form one layer.  Sprinkle the chopped up canadian bacon on top.
Stir/turn over a couple of times, several minutes apart, to prevent
excess sticking (I like crisp potatoes so I let it stick a bit).

While potatoes are cooking, mix up gravy mix (I was so brain damaged
I just microwaved some leftover gravy that I found in the fridge
:-), pour over potatoes to taste and eat.

Some good bread to sop up the gravy would be a plus. Next time I'll
add some other frozen veggies.
