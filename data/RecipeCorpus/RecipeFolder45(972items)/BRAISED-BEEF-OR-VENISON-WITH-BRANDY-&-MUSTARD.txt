Categories: Beef, Meats
1    Tbsp olive oil 1 1/4 lbs. bottom round steak, beef or
Yield: 4 Servings
venison, trimmed of fat & membrane 1/2 Cu Brandy 2 Cu defatted beef
stock
2    Tbsp. coarse-grained mustard 2 Tbsp Provence-style or Dijon
mustard 4 Shallots, peeled and thinly sliced 4 Sun dried tomatoes
(not oil packed) cut into slivers 3 large cloves of garlic, peeled
and thinly sliced
6    juniper berries
1    bay leaf

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  In a Dutch oven or deep skillet, heat
oil over medium heat.  Add meat and brown on all sides. Transfer to a
plate lined with paper towels and drain off all the fat in the pan.
Return the pan to the heat and immediately add brandy, stirring to
scrape up any browned bits in the bottom. Cook until the brandy is
reduced to a syrupy glaze. Stir in stock, mustards, shallots,
sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, juniper berries and bay leaf and bring to
a boil. Return the meat to the pan, cover tightly and pace in the
oven. Bake, turning the meat every 30 minutes, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours,
or until very tender. Remove bay leaf and season the sauce with
pepper.  Cut the meat into thin slices, arrange on platter and spoon
the sauce over. From February 1993 Eating Well Magazine, page 74.
Being out of beef stock, we used 1 1/2 cu chicken stock and 1/2 cu
red wine.  Delicious.
