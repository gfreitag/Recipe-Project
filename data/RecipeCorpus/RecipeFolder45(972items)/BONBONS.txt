fondant over lukewarm water (120 F).  Color and flavor as desired.
Place bonbons on fork or on confectioner's dipper. Dip into melted
fondant one at a time. Remove from fondant.  Drain. Place on waxed
paper. Form a swirl on the top. Nuts, fruit, and colored or white
coconut may be used in the bonbon centers or on the surface.  Set in
