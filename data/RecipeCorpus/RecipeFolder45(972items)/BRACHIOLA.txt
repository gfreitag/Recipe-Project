Categories: Beef, Oven meals, Crockpot, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
-LISA HLAVATY
2 lb Boneless round steak;
-1/4" thick and pounded
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
1    Clove garlic; minced
1    Egg; beaten
1/4 ts Pepper
2    Hard boiled eggs; sieved
2 c  Meatless spaghetti sauce
Mix together bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, beaten egg, pepper and
sieved eggs. Spread over steak. Roll up meat and tie at 1" intervals.
Spread 1 cup spaghetti sauce in bottom of baking pan slightly larger
than meat roll. Place meat on sauce and cover with remaining
sauce.Cover and bake at 350 degrees F. for 2 to 3 hours, or until
fork tender. Serve on top of spaghetti.
JEAN'S SUGGESTION:  This might cook very well in a crockpot with a
meat rack, on LOW for 6 to 8 hours, or until very tender. In that
case, I would lower the amount of spaghetti sauce used, to 3/4 to 1
cup, to allow for the meat juices that would cook out.
