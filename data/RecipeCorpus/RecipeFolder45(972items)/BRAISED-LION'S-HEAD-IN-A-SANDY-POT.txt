Title: BRAISED LION'S HEAD IN A SANDY POT
Categories: Chinese, Meats, Soups/stews
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Pork butt, ground or chopped
1/4 c  Water chestnuts, minced
1 ts Ginger root, minced
2    Green onions, minced
1/2 c  Cooked rice, minced
1 tb Dark soy
1/2 ts Sesame oil
2 tb Water
3 c  Chinese mustard cabbage,
Shredded
4 c  Stock (or water)
1/2 ts Salt, to taste
1/4 ts Sugar
6 tb Peanut oil
Preparation:  In bowl, thoroughly mix pork, water chestnuts, ginger
root, green onions, cooked rice, dark soy, sesame oil & water. Allow
mixture to marry for 30 minutes. Form into firm balls, one for each
serving, each the size of a tennis ball (about 3 1/2" across).

Braising:  Heat wok or skillet to hot; add oil.  When oil begins to
smoke, introduce meatballs 1 at a time, so as not to cool oil. Fry
meatballs until a brown crust has formed. They must be well crusted
in order to retain their shape while stewing.

Cooking in Sandy Pot:  Line sandy pot with shredded Chinese mustard
cabbage; sprinkle with pan oil from meatballs, salt & sugar. Add
meatballs, then add cool or cold stock. Bring slowly to boil; cover;
reduce heat to medium & simmer for about 2 hours. Correct seasoning
if necessary. Serve.
