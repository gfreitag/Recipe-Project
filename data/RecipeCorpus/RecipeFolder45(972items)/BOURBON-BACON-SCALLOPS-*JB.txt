Title: BOURBON-BACON SCALLOPS *JB
Categories: Shellfish, Low-cal, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Minced green onions
2 tb Bourbon
2 tb Maple syrup
1 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
1 tb Dijon mustard
1/4 ts Pepper
24 lg Sea scallops (about 1-1/2
-pounds)
6    Low-sodium bacon slices (4
-ounces)
Cooking spray
1. Combine first 6 ingredients in a bowl; stir well. Add scallops,
stirring gently to coat. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour,
stirring occasionally.

2. Remove scallops from bowl, reserving marinade. Cut each slice of
bacon into 4 pieces. Wrap 1 bacon piece around each scallop (bacon
might only wrap halfway around scallops if they are very large).
Thread scallops onto 4 (12-inch) skewers, leaving some space between
scallops so bacon will cook.

3. Place skewers on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray; broil 8
minutes or until bacon is crisp and scallops are done, basting
occasionally with reserved marinade (cooking time will vary greatly
with size of scallops).
