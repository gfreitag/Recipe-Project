Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup
flour and stir until light golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Gradually whisk in milk. Return pan to heat. Simmer gently until very
thick but still pourable, about 4 minutes.  Add cheese and basil and
stir until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Season
with salt and pepper. Stir in 1 egg.  Pour into 10-inch diameter pie
plate. Press plastic wrap onto surface of cheese mixture to prevent
skin from forming. Chill overnight.

With floured hands, form cheese mixture into walnut-size balls. Dust
cheese balls with flour. Chill until firm, about 1 hour. Press each
cheese ball into 3/4-inch-thick round.  Place remaining egg in small
bowl and beat to blend.  Place crumbs in medium bowl. Dip cheese
rounds into egg, then into crumbs, coating thoroughly.  Heat oil in
heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, fry
cheese rounds just until brown, about 1 minute per side; do not
overcook. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.
