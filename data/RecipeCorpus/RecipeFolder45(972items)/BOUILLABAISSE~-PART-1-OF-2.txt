MAKE ROUILLE:  In a food processor fitted with the cutting blade,
puree all ingredients (except the olive oil and hot pepper sauce)
until finely minced. With the motor running, add the olive oil
through the feed tube in as thin a continuous stream as possible.
Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides. Add hot pepper sauce to
taste. The rouille should be very spicy.

MAKE COURT BOUILLION:  Bring water to boil and add all ingredients.
Return to boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Skim scum from top while
simmering.

Simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove all solids and strain through double
layer of cheesecloth.

MAKE BOUILLABAISSE:  Cook lobsters in boiling water for 15 minutes,
until bright red.  Remove all meat from tail and claws. Cut into
chunks and set aside. Scrub mussels and clams well to remove sand.
De-beard mussels by pulling black fibers from shell.

Steam mussels and clams over 1 inch of water for about 10 minutes,
until shells open.  Discard any unopened mussels or clams. Remove one
shell from each mussel and clam, leaving meat in other shell. Strain
clam/mussel broth through double layer of cheese cloth and reserve 3
cups. Shell the shrimp.

In a large skillet, heat olive oil.  Saute onion, leek, carrot,
fennel, garlic, sage, saffron and orange peel until onions are soft
and golden.

In a large pot, bring to a boil about 8-10 cups of court bouillon,
reserved clam/mussel broth and about 2 cups wine. Add sauteed
vegetables, bay leaf, parsley and wine and bring to simmer. Add salt
and pepper to taste

Cut fish into large chunks.  Add fish and shrimp and simmer 8-10
minutes. Add lobster, mussels and clams and simmer 2 minutes. Serve
in soup plates over garlic toast.
