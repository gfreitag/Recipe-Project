Title: BONELESS CORNISH HEN W/PORT ORANGE SAUCE
Categories: Poultry, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
4    Cornish game hens
(2 lb each)
Salt and pepper
1    Peel of 1 orange, thinly
Sliced
1 ts Lemon juice
1 1/2 oz Orange liqueur (Curacao)
1 c  Mandarin orange sections
2 c  Wild rice mix
2 c  Orange juice
4 ts Brown sugar
Cornstarch
1    Bunch watercress
To prepare hens for stuffing, remove the skin from the backbone area
and set aside. Cut out the backbone, open the hen and remove all
bones except the drumsticks. Boil the wild rice until tender, cool
and stuff hens. Close the hen with drumsticks in the air and use the
skin from the backbone to wrap the hen so it will stand in the baking
pan breast side up. Season hens with salt and pepper. Roast at 350F
for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

SAUCE: Combine the orange juice, lemon juice and brown sugar in a
saucepan and bring to a boil. Use cornstarch mixed with a little
water to achieve desired thickness. Stir in liqueur and peel and keep
warm.

Servings: 6
