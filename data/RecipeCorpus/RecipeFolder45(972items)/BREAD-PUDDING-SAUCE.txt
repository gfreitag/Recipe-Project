Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
2 ea Egg yolks
1/2 c  Bourbon (more or less, to ta
Cream butter & sugar over medium heat til all butter is absorbed.
Remove from heat and blend in egg yolks. Gradually add bourbon, to
taste, stirring constantly. Sauces thickens as it cools. Serve warm
over warm bread pudding.  (Can be refrigerated & reheated for a day
or two.)
For variety, substitute your choice of fruit juice or liquer for the
whiskey -- or use a combination -- to complement flavors in the bread
pudding.  (eg, if you use coconut in the BP, substitute pina colad
for some of the milk in the BP recipe, and maybe 6T rum and 2T pina
colada in the sauce.)
