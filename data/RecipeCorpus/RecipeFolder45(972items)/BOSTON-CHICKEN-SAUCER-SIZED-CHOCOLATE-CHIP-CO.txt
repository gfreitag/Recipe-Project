4 oz Nestle's Milk Chocolate
Bars
4 oz Baker's german sweet choc
4 oz Dove milk chocolate
Cookie dough (your recipe)
Melt 3 chocolates, stirring until smooth. Pur into greased 9" metal
pie pan and refrigerate until hard. Hammer into pea-sized bits. Store
refrigerated until ready to use. Use 1/3c dookie dough, flattening to
a 3-1/2 to 4" round. Bake at 375~ for 16 to 18 minutes or until
golden brown but not overbaked or cookies will be hard as rocks when
cooled. The cookies will look almost "raw" at the end of 16 minutes
if you make them big enough and will continue to bake in their own
heat as they cool on the sheeets a few minutes. Source: Gloria Pitzer.
