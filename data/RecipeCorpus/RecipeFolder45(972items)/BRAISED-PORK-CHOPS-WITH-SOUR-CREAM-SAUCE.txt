Categories: French, Pork, Sauces, From cook4u
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb 4 center-cut loin chops
1 tb Corn oil
1/4 c  Carrots, chopped
1/4 c  Celery, chopped
1/2 c  Onions, chopped
1 tb Garlic, minced
1/4 ts Thyme
1    Bay leaf
3    Sprigs of fresh parsley
1/4 c  Dry white wine
3/4 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Capers, drained
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet large enough to hold the chops in
one layer. Add the chops and cook until golden brown on both sides,
about 5 min. 2. Scatter the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, thyme,
bayleaf and parsley around the chops. Cover and cook 10 min. 3. Blend
the wine, chicken broth and tomato paste and add to the skillet.
Cover closely and cook about 25 min. longer, turning the chops once.
4. Remove the chops and keep hot. Add the mustard and sour cream to
the skillet and stir. Bring just to a boil, but do not boil or the
sour cream will curdle. Put the sauce through a fine sieve, pressing
down with a wooden spoon to extract the liquid flavorings from the
vegetables. 5. Pour the sauce into a saucepan and add the capers.
Reheat gently without boiling. 6. Spoon the sauce over the chops.

This is great when you have guest over.
