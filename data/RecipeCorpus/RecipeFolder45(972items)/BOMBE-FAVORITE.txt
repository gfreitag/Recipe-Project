Title: BOMBE FAVORITE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Crﾂ確e fraiche
15 g  Icing sugar; plus...
2 tb Icing sugar; sifted
75 g  Little macaroons
-- broken in pieces
1    Egg white
A favourite indeed. Small pieces of macaroon are folded into a crﾂ確e
fraiche ice cream base and lightly frozen. A delicious dessert for
summer.

Whisk the crﾂ確e fraiche with the sifted icing sugar. Fold in the
macaroon pieces. Beat the egg white until very stiff, add 2 tbs of
icing sugar and beat again. Fold into the crﾂ確e fraiche mixture and
put into a serving-dish. Freeze lightly - about 2 hours - before
serving, so that it comes out like soft ice cream.
