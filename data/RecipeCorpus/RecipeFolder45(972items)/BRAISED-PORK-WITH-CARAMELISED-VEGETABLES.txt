Title: BRAISED PORK WITH CARAMELISED VEGETABLES
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Carrots
1    Fennel Bulb
1/2 lb French Beans
1 lb New Potatoes
Olive Oil
4    Pork Chops
1 pt Cider
1    Onion, Peeled and finely
-chopped
1    Garlic Clove
2 tb Finely Chopped Parsley
Salt and Pepper
Trim, peel and cut the carrots into three-inch lengths. Cut the top
and bottom off the fennel and cut into quarter-inch slices and then
in half. Trim the beans and wash the potatoes.

Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a shallow pan wide enough to
take the chops surrounded by the vegetables in one layer. Lightly
colour the chops and remove. Add the onion and saute for 10 minutes
without colouring. This is important as you need to draw the sugars
out from the onion which will help in the caramelisation. Add the
garlic and the rest of the vegetables coating them thoroughly in the
oil.

Return the chops to the pan and pour over the cider. Bring to the
boil, allow to reduce for five minutes, lower the heat so the liquid
is at a bare simmer, season with salt and pepper, cover and cook for
15 minutes, or until the meat is done. Remove and keep warm. Turn up
the heat and continue cooking until the sauce becomes thick and coats
the vegetables. Serve with the chops and a genorous sprinkling of
parsley.
