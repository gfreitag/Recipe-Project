Title: BREAST OF WHITE GUINEA HEN
Categories: Game, Harned 1994, Main dish, Poultry, Rice/grains
Yield: 6 Servings
6    White guinea hen breasts*
-- abt. 3/4 lb. each
3 tb Butter
Salt; to taste
1 ts White pepper
2 tb Flour
1/2 ts Beau Monde seasoned salt
1    Garlic clove; mashed
1 tb Parsley; chopped very finely
1 tb Green onion; chopped finely
-- both white & green parts
3 c  Rich chicken stock
-- all fat removed
1 tb Parmesan cheese
1 ts Maggi seasoning
2 tb Dry sherry
3/4 c  Sliced, sauteed mushrooms
Cooked rice
Artichoke hearts
Butter
*Chicken breasts can be substituted.

Remove skin.  Rub breasts with melted butter, salt and pepper; brown
lightly in heavy iron skillet and then place in roaster, meaty side
down.

Make sauce by melting butter and flour; simmer 10 minutes, browning
only very slightly.  Add Beau Monde, garlic, pepper and salt to
taste, parsley, onion and chicken stock. Then add Parmesan, Maggi and
sherry; whip until smooth.  This should be a rather thin sauce, so a
little more chicken stock may be added if necessary. Pour over guinea
breasts; cover and bake at 275 F. for 2 hours.  Remove breasts;
strain sauce and add sauteed mushrooms.

Place breasts in center of mound of rice; place artichoke hearts on
each side of guinea and glaze with sauce.
