You should be able to convert dog biscuit recipes to your bread
machine. If you have a 1 1/2 lb. machine, use about 1 cup liquid
(eggs count as a scant 1/4 cup liquid) and a total of 3 cups of dry
ingredients (flour and grains).  If the mixture is too stiff for your
machine to mix easily, add 1 to 2 tbsp. more liquid. Hope this helps.

using this method - use only dough cycle, then remove and roll or pat
dough out and bake in the oven....
