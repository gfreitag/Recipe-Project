Title: BOUGATSA
Categories: Desserts, Greek
Yield: 8 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1/2 lb Cream cheese
1 lb Fresh ricotta cheese
1 lb Fresh lg-curd cottage cheese
Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
18    Sheets commercial filo
1/2 c  Butter (or more); melted
Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese at high speed until
light and fluffy.  Lower the speed and add the ricotta, cottage
cheese, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and the nutmeg. Beat for 1 minute at
high speed, then set aside while you prepare the filo.
Lay the filo flat on a table and keep covered with a damp towel
over waxed paper or plastic wrap.  By stacking 4 sheets, form a base
of 15 x 18 inches, brushing the top of each sheet with melted butter
as you stack them.  Then lay 2 sheets at right angles over the
center, using the "base" as a diamond, not a square, brushing the
center of each with butter. Divide the filling into 3 parts and
spread one part over the filo to form a 7-inch square.  Set the rest
of the filling aside. Fold the top filo sheet over the cheese and
brush with butter, and continue folding the filo over the cheese to
make a square, brushing each time with butter. With a wide spatula,
lift the bougatsa and invert onto a cookie sheet. Brush the top with
butter and set aside.
Repeat with the remaining filo, filling until all 3 square pies
are folded.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until
the filo puffs up and turns a golden chestnut color. Cut into small
squares and sprinkle with additional sugar.  Serve piping hot.
