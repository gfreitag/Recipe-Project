Title: BOEUF EN FICELLE
Categories: Beef, French
Yield: 1 Roast
3 1/4 lb Beef filet, well-trimmed
3 qt Beef broth
4    Onion; quartered
4    Carrot; sliced
4    Celery rib; sliced
2    Turnip; quartered
8 sm Shallot; minced
Securely tie beef both lengthwise and crosswise with string. If
chilled, bring to room temperature before cooking.

Combine broth, onion, carrot, celery and turnip in large stockpot
with side handles. Boil vigorously 30 minutes.

Tie meat to handles, suspending as closely as possible to broth
without actually touching. Cover tightly and let steam until meat
thermometer registers 120 F. (rare), about 18 to 20 minutes.

Slip large fork under wrapping strings, then remove meat to platter.
Cut strings holding meat. Let rest 5 minutes before carving; do not
remove strings around meat until after it has been carved. Slice
thinly, allowing 2 or 3 slices per serving, or cut into 8 thicker
slices. Save juices to moisten each portion. Reassemble slices, wrap
with foil and keep warm but serve as soon as possible. Garnish each
serving with shallots and accompany with Sauce Moutarde-Batarde or
Red Pepper Jelly, or both.
