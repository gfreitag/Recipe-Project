Title: BRAISED CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS
Categories: Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
8    Chicken fryer drumsticks
Cornstarch for dredging
3 c  Oil for deep-frying
1 c  Dried chestnuts
1    Five-spice bouquet (OR
1 tb Five-spice powder)
4 c  Cold water
1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
1/2 c  Rock sugar
1/2 c  Medium sherry
1/2 ts Salt
Preparation:  At least 12 hours before cooking this dish, rinse
several times then soak dried chestnuts. After soaking, remove pieces
of skin wedged in nutmeat.

Deep-frying:  In wok or suitable pan, slowly heat deep-frying oil;
oil is ready when bubbles quickly form around chopstick held
vertically in oil. Meanwhile, dredge drumsticks in cornstarch; shake
off excess starch. Deep- fry drumsticks 2 at a time until brown,
about 5 minutes. Remove from oil; drain.

Red-cooking:  Pour water in sandy pot or comparable casserole dish;
add 5- spice bouquet, soy sauce, sherry & salt (5-spice powder can be
substituted, though the final flavor will be less distinctive).
Slowly bring to boil, reduce heat, cover pot & simmer 15 minutes.
Remove cover; discard bouquet; add salt & rock sugar; dissolve rock
sugar. You can stop here until near serving time.

About 30 minutes before serving time, add drumsticks & soaked
chestnuts to hot red-cooked sauce.  Simmer in covered pot for 15
minutes; remove cover; simmer for another 15 minutes. Sauce should
have reduced by about 1/3, and become bright & thick.

To serve, prop drumsticks up around sides of sandy pot; spear
chestnuts with sate sticks or long toothpicks.
