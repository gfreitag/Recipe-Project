Title: BREWER'S CHICKEN
Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    4-lb chicken; quartered
1/4 c  Butter
1 tb Vegetable oil
1    Onion; sliced thinly
1 c  Beer
4 tb Tomato paste
1    Bay leaf
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Light cream
Boiled rice; to serve
Melt the butter and oil in a flameproof casserole or a heavy-bottomed
pan large enough to hold the chicken in one layer. When the foaming
stops, brown the chicken over medium-high heat, turning it until
golden on all sides.  Remove the pieces from the pan and add the
onion, cooking until golden and stirring frequently.

Replace the chicken in the casserole or pan, mix the beer and tomatoe
paste together and pour the mixture around the chicken. Add the bay
leaf and seaon with salt and pepper. Cover and cook the chicken over
low heat for 45 minutes or until tender.

Place the chicken quarters on a bed of boiled rice and keep warm.
Skim off any fat from the cooking liquid, stir in the cream and
reheat without letting it boil, then pour it over the chicken and
rice and serve.

This recipe for chicken and beer comes from Switzerland's Tecino
region, where the cooking tends toward Italian-style.
