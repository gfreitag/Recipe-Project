This is a hearty sweet and sour meat sup that can be used as a main
dish. oup.   Bubbies  measurements were never exact. You need to
taste. Put meat and bones in a 8 or 12 qt stock pot. Put in cans of
tomato, cover with water and bring to a boil. In the meantime, get
your veggies ready. Slice beets and carrots, others go in whole. When
stock boils, skim off top. Put in beets, carrots, garlic, and other
veggies. Turn heat down to a simmer and keep lid on askew. After
about an hour, put in garlic and sugar. I have used Sweet and Low.
Amounts are a matter of preference. It should have a rich, sweet and
sour taste. I break up the meat and stir it back into the soup before
serving.
