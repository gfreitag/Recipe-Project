Title: BREAD RECIPE
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
6 c  Flour
1 pk Dry yeast
1/2 c  Milk
3 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
3 tb Butter or margarine
Heat the milk 3 tbsp butter and 1.5 cups water to about 130 degrees.
Add this to 2 cups of flour and the rest of the dry ingredients and
beat for about 2 minutes at medium speed till you have a batter add
aprox 3 cups of flour beating with a large spoon until you have a
soft dough adding aditional flour as needed.
Knead this on a lightly flowered surface for about 10 minutes until
the dough is smooth and elastic. form this into a ball and let rise
in a lightly greased bowl for 1 hour or until doubled.
When doubled punch down and push edges into middle then cut in half
cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Form into loaves and place in
lightly greased pan to again double. Preheat oven to 400 degrees then
bake for about 25 to 30 minutes.
This makes a nice tasty bread but I would like it to be not as
dense. Where do I start: 1. more or less kneading? 2. use less flour?
3. more
