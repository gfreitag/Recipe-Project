Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM------------------------CREPE BATTER-----------------------------
125 g  Flour (4.5 oz)
15 g  Sugar (0.5 oz)
1 pn Salt
2    Eggs
3 dl Milk, boiled and cooled
-- (5/8 pint)
1 dl Double cream ( 3.5 fl oz)
1 tb Curagao
Clarified butter for the pan
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
6    Sugar lumps
2    Oranges
180 g  Softened butter ( 6 oz)
180 g  Sugar
3 tb Curagao
THE BATTER: Put the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl and stir in the
eggs, one at a time, with a wooden spatula. Pour in one-third of the
milk and mix until smooth and homogenous. Stir in the cream, the rest
of the milk and the curagao, cover the bowl with a plate and leave
the batter to stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before
cooking the crepes. COOKING THE CREPES: Brush the pan with clarified
butter and heat it. Ladle in a little batter, tilt the pan to spread
it thinly over the base and cook the crepe for about 1.5 minutes,
then turn it over with a palette knife and cook for about 1.5 minutes
more, until golden on both sides. Place the crepe on a plate and make
more crepes in the same way: you should end up with 18 crepes ! THE
SAUCE: Rub the sugar lumps again the orange skin to absorb as much
flavour as possible. With a wire whisk, work together the softened
butter and sugar, then add the curagao and sugar lumps. SERVING:
Squeeze the orange juice into a pan, set over high heat and reduce by
half. Bring the pan to the table, set it on a spirit stove - or a
fondue heater - and beat the butter mixture into the orange juice,
bringing the mixture to the boil. As soon as the sauce bubbles, lift
one crepe at a time with a fork and spread it in the sauce, turn it
over and fold into quarters. Repeat with all the crepes. --
