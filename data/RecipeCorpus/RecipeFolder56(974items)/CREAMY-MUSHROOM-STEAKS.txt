Categories: None

2 sm Beef Top Loin Steaks
1 tb Butter
MMMMM-------------------------THE SAUCE------------------------------
1/2 lb Mushrooms, Sliced
1 tb Butter
3 tb Onion, Chopped
2 tb All-Purpose Flour
1 1/2 c  Half and Half
1 ts Soy Sauce
1 ts Onion, Grated

Trim the steaks of excess fat and allow to sit at room temperature
for 2 to 3 hours. Prepare the mushroom sauce. Saute the sliced
mushrooms in butter for a few minutes in a heavy saucepan until they
just start to brown. Add the chopped onions and saute until they are
golden and transparent. Sprinkle with flour and stir to blend well.
Add the half and half a little at a time while stirring. Simmer until
thick and creamy. Add the soy sauce, grated onion and salt and pepper
to taste. Brown some butter in a skillet. Add the steaks. Brown
slightly on both sides. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for a few
minutes in their own juices. Add the mushroom sauce to the skillet.
Let the steaks simmer in the sauce until they are tender and done to
your liking. Remove the membranes and seeds from the bell peppers and
slice vertically into thin strips. Use as a garnish on the steaks.
Serve while hot.
