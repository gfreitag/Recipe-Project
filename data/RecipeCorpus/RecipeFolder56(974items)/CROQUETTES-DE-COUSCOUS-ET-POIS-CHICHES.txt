Title: CROQUETTES DE COUSCOUS ET POIS CHICHES
Categories: Main dish, French, Vegetables
Yield: 24 Patties
2/3 c  Hulled, raw sunflower seeds
2 c  Cooked and drained chickpeas
1 c  Uncooked couscous
1/2 c  Tomato juice
1/2 c  Dry red wine
3 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Dijon mustard
2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 ts Dried rosemary
1 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Black pepper
3 tb Minced fresh parsley
3    Garlic cloves; pressed
1 tb Olive oil
Preheat oven to 350F.  Spread sunflower seeds on a baking tray.
Remove any shells or discolored seeds. Bake 5-7 minutes until seeds
smell nutty and darken slightly. Grind seeds in a food processor for
30 seconds until coarsely chopped. Add chickpeas and process until
well mixed. Keep mixture in the food processor.

In a heavy, 1 quart pot, combine couscous, tomato juice and red wine.
Stir & bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer for 2-3 minutes
until the couscous has absorbed all the liquid.  Let sit 5 more
minutes. Add cooked couscous to chickpea mixture along with remaining
ingredients except oil. Mix well, stopping the processor and scraping
down the sides once or twice, until smooth.

Lightly oil your hands. Shape 2 to 3 Tb of chickpea mixture between
your hands to form a ball. Repeat with remaining mixture until you
have 24 balls. Flatten balls to form patties about 2" wide and 1/2"
thick. Brush croquettes with olive oil and place on a lightly oiled
baking tray. Bake for 15 minutes, turn the croquettes over, brush
with oil and bake another 10-12 minutes.

These may be served in a sandwich, as an appetizer or as a main dish
with pasta and tomato sauce.
