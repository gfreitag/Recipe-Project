Title: CROCKPOT CHILI BEEF SHORT RIBS
Categories: Crockpot
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Short ribs
1 tb Vegetable oil
2    Garlic cloves
2 ts Chili powder
1    15 oz tomato sauce
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1    Onion
2    Cans red kidney beans
Put ribs in pot of boiling water, reduce heat and simmer for 10
minutes. Remove ribs from water and drain well to remove as much fat
as possible. (This can easily be done the evening before to save time
in the morning.) Brown ribs in hot oil.  Remove, drain all but 1 tsp
fat. Add chopped garlic, lightly brown in oil^^. Add chili powder,
tomato sauce, bring to simmer. (I do all of this the evening before
to save more time.) Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper put in
crockpot. Add sauce and sliced onion. Cover and slow cook 6 to 8
hours on low. Remove bones from pot, skim off any visable fat. Add
kidney beans, cover and cook on high one hour. Serve with cornbread.
