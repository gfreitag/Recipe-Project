Title: CROCKPOT BLACK BEANS & RICE
Categories: Crockpot, Vegetables
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 lb Dried black turtle beans
1 lg Bell pepper (diced)
1    Hot pepper (optional)
4 ds Tabasco (optional)
4 lg Onions (diced)
6 cl Garlic (diced)
3/4 c  Celery (diced)
1/4 c  Parsley (minced)
2 tb Oregano (minced)
2 tb Basil (minced)
2    Bay leaves
1 pn Cloves (2 to 3)
1/2 ts Ground cumin
4    Beef boullion cubes
2 tb Vinegar (add last)
1 lb Lean bulk pork sausage
1 lb Pork (boneless cubed)
1 lb Stew beef chunks
1/2 lb Ham, smoked (1/2" cubes)
1 1/2 lb Smoked link sausage cut into
1" to 2" lengths
Salt and pepper to taste
Beans: Wash and look for gravel then soak overnight in a bowl being
sure beans are well covered with water. For cooking use a large crock
pot.

Meats: First, brown bulk sausage in a skillet and pour off excess
grease. Add other meats and stir to brown. Add bell pepper, onion,
garlic, celery, and spices. Salt and pepper moderately, taste after
cooking several hours and add more if needed.

Add beans and soak water. If necessary add more water to cover entire
ingredients by at least two inches. Stir in four bouillon cubes.
Cover and cook on crock pot high for three hours then turn to low for
at least six hours.

I like to use the crock pot and leave it cooking on low overnight. I
stir it about twice and sometimes find it necessary to add water. If
it gets too thin, take about 1/2 cup of beans and mash with a fork
until pasty to add back as a thickener. About an hour before serving
stir in vinegar.

I enjoy hot and spicy foods so I like to add the hot pepper (jalapeno,
habanero or whatever you like) and Tabasco. If you don't like it hot,
then leave them out or serve the Tabasco at the table.

Serve beans and meat over rice. I have found brown rice to be quite
tasty but white rice is fine too. Serve in a soup bowl and top with
fresh chopped onion.
