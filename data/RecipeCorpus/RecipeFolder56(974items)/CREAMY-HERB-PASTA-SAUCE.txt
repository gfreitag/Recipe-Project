Title: CREAMY HERB PASTA SAUCE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Half-and-half
1/2 c  Butter or margarine -- cut
Into 8 chunks
2/3 c  Parmesan, Asiago or Romano
Cheese -- freshly grated
3/4 c  Fresh herbs -- chopped
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper -- to taste
Note: Fresh herbs can be any combination of parsely, chives, basil,
mint and oregano.

1. Combine half-and-half and butter in a saucepan. Boil gently about
20 minutes, until mixture has reduced to 1-1/2 to 1-2/3 cups.

2. Remove pan from heat; whisk in cheese and herbs. Use immediately
or cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze (see Timesaver
Tip).

3. To serve: Cook 1-1/4 to 1-1/3 pounds fresh or fresh-frozen
fettucine, or 12 ounces dried, following package directions. Drain.
Toss with sauce.

Makes 2 cups (4 main dish or 6 appetizer servings).

* Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead, covered and
refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into a freezer
container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 2 months. To
serve, defrost sauce 15 to 20 minutes in microwave oven on Defrost
setting, stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to 24
hours. Gently warm sauce in a saucepan or microwave oven on 50% power
until warmed through, about 3 minutes, whisking frequently and
vigorously to bring it to a creamy consistency.
