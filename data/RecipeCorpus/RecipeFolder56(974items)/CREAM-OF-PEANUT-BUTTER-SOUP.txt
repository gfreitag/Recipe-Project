Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
2 sm Onions
2 c  Heavy cream
3    Stalks celery
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
3 tb Butter
Salt to taste
3 tb Flour
3/4 c  Coarsely crumbled
6 c  Chicken broth
Tostados (or Fritos)
3/4 c  Peanut butter
Peel and mince the onions.  Wash and coarsely chop the celery. Melt
the butter in a soup kettle and add the onions and celery. Saute
until the onions are golden and transparent. Stir in the flour and
cook a few minutes longer.  Gradually stir in the chicken broth,
using the back of a spoon to press out any lumps. Bring to a boil,
mix in the peanut butter, and continue to stir until the soup boils
once more.

Remove the kettle from the stove and let rest for 5 minutes, spooning
off any peanut oil that rises to the top. Reheat and stir in the
cream. Add salt according to your taste. Reheat slightly over very
low heat if necessary.  Ladle into individual soup bowls and place a
generous dollop of sour cream on top of each. Sprinkle with crumbled
tostados. Serves 8
