Preheat the oven to 350ø.  Spray a 9-in pie plate with non-stick
cooking spray.  Set aside.

Mix cookie crumbs with the cinnamon and about 2 Tbsp of the egg white
in a small bowl, crumbling the mixture together with your fingers
until crumbs are moistened but not soggy or sticky (add a few more
drops of egg white if needed). Turn the mixture into the prepared pie
plate, then press it into the bottom and up the sides of the plate.
Bake the crust for 8 minutes, then raise the oven temperature to 400ø.

While the crust bakes, whisk all of the filling ingredients together
in a large mixing bowl. To avoid spills, pour the mixture into the
crust while still on the oven shelf.

Bake 45 minutes, or until the filling is set but still slightly
wobbly in the center. Remove from oven and sprinkle with crystallized
ginger, if using. Cool pie to room temperature. Garnish with fresh
fruit, if you like. Makes 8 servings.
