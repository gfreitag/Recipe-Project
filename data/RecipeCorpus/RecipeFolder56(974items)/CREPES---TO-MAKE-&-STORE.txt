Title: CREPES - TO MAKE & STORE
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Cold water and whole milk
4    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
About 1 1/3 cups flour
Vegetable oil or melted
Butter
In a blender or food processor combine the water, milk, eggs salt and
flour. With a rubber spatula, scrape down any batter which adheres to
the sides of the processor. If the batter appears thick, add more
water; if too thin, then gradually whisk in more flour. Let the
batter set, in the refrigerator for an hour or so.

Rub an 7-inch crepe pan or non-stick pan with oil or melted butter.
Set over high heat until pan just begins to smoke. Ladle about 3
tablespoons of batter into the hot pan. Lift the pan from the heat
and swirl the batter around so that it evenly coats the bottom. Pour
excess back into the batter for the next crepe. Let the crepe cook on
one side for about a minute or until it looks dried out. Flip the
crepe over and cook it for 30 seconds on the other side. Repeat until
all are done.

To store, stack them, with waxed paper or parchment squares in
between each one and freeze in batches.

Yield: about 12 crepes

QUICK CREPE IDEAS

Fill each crepe with a couple of tablespoonfuls of lightly sweetened
ricotta or cottage cheese. Roll up, sprinkle with sugar and run under
the broiler just to heat. Serve with a topping of mixed chopped up
fresh fruit

Fill each crepe with ricotta or other cheese combined with chopped
basil, olives or parsley. Arrange them in a shallow baking dish, dot
with grated Parmesan and cover with tomato sauce if you wish; and
brown under a moderate broiler

Fill each crepe with a white or veloute sauce in which you have mixed
some chopped buttered spinach, or diced chicken or ham. Cover with
cheese sauce, sprinkle with more 3 to 4 tablespoons more of cheese
and heat in the oven; brown in the broiler
