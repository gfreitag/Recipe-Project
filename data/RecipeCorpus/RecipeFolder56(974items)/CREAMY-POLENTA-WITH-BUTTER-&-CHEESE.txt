Title: CREAMY POLENTA WITH BUTTER & CHEESE
Categories: Misc
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ts Salt
1 c  Polenta (not instant)
Unsalted butter and freshly
Grated Parmesan cheese,
For serving
In a heavy medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Reduce
the heat to low and add the salt. Slowly pour the polenta into the
water, stirring constantly. Keep stirring for about 5 minutes, until
evenly thickened and soupy.  Adjust the heat to the lowest setting so
that the polenta barely bubbles. Cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring
every few minutes to keep it from sticking to the pan. If it gets too
thick, just add water in small amounts until it is the consistency
you want. When done, eat it right away with butter and Parmesan
cheese.
