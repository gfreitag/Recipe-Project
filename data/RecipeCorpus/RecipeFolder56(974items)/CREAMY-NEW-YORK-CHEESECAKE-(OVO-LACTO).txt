2    (32oz) cartons Non-Fat plain
Yogurt
1/2 c  Honey

5    Egg whites
Day before drain yogurt to make Yogurt Cheese.

( I used cheesecloth pulled tightly over a large bowl and secured the
cheesecloth with a big rubberband just under the rim and then dumped
the yogurt on top of the cheesecloth and let the liquid drain into
the bowl, voila, yogurt cheese!!)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Prepare Basic Graham Cracker Crust below in a springform pan and chill
while preparing the cheesecake.

With a rotary beater or hand mixer, beat yogurt cheese, honey,
vanilla, arrowroot and egg whites until thoroughly blended.

Pour filling into chilled graham cracker crust.

Bake at 300 degrees for 60-75 minutes, until center is set and
surface is lightly browned.

Remove from oven, cool to room temperature, refrigerate several hours
until thoroughly chilled.
