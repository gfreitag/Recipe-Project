Categories: Crockpot, Meats
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Round steak; lean

Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 8:00 * Use dried onions
or finely chop about 1/2 of a fresh onion.

1. Cut the steak into serving size pieces. If desired you can
brown the meat in a little hot oil before adding to crockpot. Place
the thinly sliced pepper rings in bottom of crockpot, reserving a few
to place on top of meat if desired. (Vegetables cook better when
placed on bottom of pot.) Arrange the meat on pepper, careful to not
stack one piece directly on top of another. Mix all other ingredients
and pour over meat and peppers.
2. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for about 4
hours. Serve with mashed potatoes and simply seasoned vegetables.
