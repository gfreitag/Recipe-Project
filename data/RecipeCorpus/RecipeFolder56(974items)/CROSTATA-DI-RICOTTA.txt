1    Recipe double-crust
-pasta frolla (recipe
-precedes), with orange
-zest
1/3 c  Raisins
2 tb Grappa or brandy
2 lg Eggs
A 15-ounce container
-whole-milk ricotta
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Freshly grated orange zest
2 oz Fine-quality bittersweet
-(not unsweetened)
-chocolate,
Chopped fine
An egg wash made by
-beating 1 large egg yolk
-with 1 teaspoon water
Confectioners' sugar for
-dusting the tart if
-desired
Roll out the larger disk of dough 1/8 inch thick on a floured
surface, fit it into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim,
and crimp the edge. Chill the shell for 30 minutes.

In a small bowl combine the raisins and the grappa and let the raisins
macerate for 30 minutes. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the
ricotta, the granulated sugar, the vanilla, and the zest, stir in the
chocolate and the raisin mixture, and pour the filling into the shell.

Roll out the remaining disk of dough 1/8 inch thick on a floured
surface, cut it into 1/2-inch-wide strips with a fluted pastry wheel,
and arrange some of the strips, about 1 inch apart, over the filling.
(If desired, arrange the remaining strips, about 1 inch apart,
perpendicular to the others, forming a lattice, but do not weave the
strips.) Trim all the strips, press them against the inside of the
shell, and brush them with the egg wash. Bake the tart in the middle
of a preheated 350 degree oven for 50 minutes, or until the pastry is
golden and a knife inserted in the center of the filling comes out
clean, and let it cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Remove
the rim, let the tart cool completely on the rack, and dust it with
the confectioners' sugar.
