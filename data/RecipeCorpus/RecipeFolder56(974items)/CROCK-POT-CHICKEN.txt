Title: CROCK-POT CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Carrots, sliced
1    Onion, quartered
3    Celery stalks w/leaves
- cut in 1-inch pieces
6    Mushrooms, med size, sliced
2    Garlic cloves
- coarsely chopped
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 ts Basil leaves
1/2 c  Water, chicken broth,
- or white wine
1    Whole chicken, about 3 lbs
Put carrots, celery, and mushrooms in bottom of crock-pot. Place whole
chicken on top.  Place onions and garlic around chicken, placing some
of each in cavity of the chicken. Top with the salt, pepper, and
liquid. Sprinkle the basil over the chicken.  Cover and cook on LOW
for 8 to 10 hours (using HIGH, 3 1/2 to 5 hours using 1 cup liquid).
Remove chicken and veggies.  I serve this with rice, but you could
also add some potatoes in the crock- pot (if you have room) and
that'll work, too. FOR A GRAVY, I've used 4 tb of flour in the
"drippings" and used a hand blender (it came out nicely)...  Or you
can use 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup blended into the "drippings."
