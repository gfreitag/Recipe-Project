Title: CREME DE ABACATE - AVOCADO CREAM
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 lg Avocados
Juice of 1 Lime
Zest of 1 Lime
3 tb Lime Juice
4 tb Caster Sugar
This Brazilian dessert is particularly simple to make so it can be
prepared just before serving - which is just as well as it prevents
any problem with the surface darkening.

Grate the zest of 1 lime and juice 1 or more limes to obtain 3
tablespoons juice (this can be done ahead of time). Halve 2 large
avocados, scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender, add 3
tablespoons of lime juice and 4 tablespoons of caster sugar. Process
till smooth. Pile the cream into serving dishes and scatter lime zest
over the top.
