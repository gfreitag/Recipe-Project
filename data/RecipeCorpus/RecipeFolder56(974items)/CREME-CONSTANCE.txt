"Despite the simplicity of this recipe, it is delightful and subtle,
although this depends very much upon the quality of the basic
ingredients used." IMH
Melt butter, and soften the very finely chopped onion over gentle
heat. When tender, but not browned, add curry powder (which should be
of good quality, and ideally home made) and continue cooking 1-2
mins. Stir in flour and cook to make a roux for a further minute or
so. :    Remove from heat and when slightly cooled, gradually stir in
stock and milk. Return to heat and stir while bringing to the boil.
When boiling, reduce heat and simmer gently 15 minutes or so.
Add coconut milk (or creamed coconut if the milk is unavailable)
and stir to incorporate. Strain, correct seasoning and reheat. Serve
with a little cream marbled on the surface, and a slice of lemon.
