Day old bread
Cut bread into small squares - any size will do. Spread in a baking
pan and add your favorite herbs and spices. Bake at 200 to 225 for up
to 2 hours. After every 30 minutes, give them a stir and poke with a
fork to see whether they are done to your liking. They will turn a
golden brown and taste yummy. Low fat - low calorie - and delicious.
