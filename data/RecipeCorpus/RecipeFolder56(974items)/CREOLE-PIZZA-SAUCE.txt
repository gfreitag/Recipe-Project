Title: CREOLE PIZZA SAUCE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 1 Servings
3 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Onion -- finely chop
1/2 c  Celery -- finely chop
1/2 c  Green or red bell pepper --
Finely chop
1/4 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Basil
1    Bay leaf
Salt and pepper -- to taste
1/2 ts Cayenne
14 oz Can whole tomatoes
3 oz Tomato paste
Tabasco sauce -- to taste
Grated rind and juice from
1/2    Lemon
2 tb Parsley fresh -- chopped
Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan and saute the onions, celery,
and red or green bell pepper over medium heat until soft. Crumble in
the spices, stirring for another minute. Add the tomatoes, tomato
paste, lemon juice and rind, cover and simmer on low for about 30
minutes. After 30 minutes, check the seasoning and add the hot sauce,
to taste. Stir in the fresh parsley. Variations: This makes an
extremely thick sauce. I had to add about 1/2 cup water to the sauce.
Yields approximately 3 1/4 cups of sauce. Great with shrimp used as
the topping for the pizza, esp. if the shrimp is boiled in crab boil,
and lightly sprinkled with Creole seasoning. I add the shrimp the
last 3-4 minutes to the top of the pizza. Source:Pizza Pizzaz, by
