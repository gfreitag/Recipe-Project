Title: CREAM OF SALSIFY & MUSHROOM SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
450 g  Salsify ( 1 lb)
2    Onions, chopped
3 tb Sunflower oil
275 g  Mushrooms (9 2/3 oz),
-- cleaned and roughly
-- chopped
1 tb Olive oil
1 l  Water (2 1/8 pints)
25 g  Butter (1 oz)
25 g  Flour (1 oz)
1 1/2 dl Milk (1/4 pint)
Sea salt
Black pepper, freshly ground
Scrub the salsify in plenty of water, discard the ends of the roots
and cut into 1 cm (1/2 in) lengths. Soften the onions with the
salsify in the sunflower oil for 10 ... 15 minutes in a heavy,
covered pan. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, as salsify is
dry. Meanwhile stew the mushrooms in the olive oil until they have
given off their liquid, reserve the liquid and add the mushrooms to
the salsify and onions. Cover with the water and bring to the boil;
simmer for 20 minutes. In a heavy pan, melt the butter, stir in the
flour and gradually add first the mushrooms-liquid, then the milk.
When you have a thick sauce, slowly stir in the liquid from the soup,
add the vegetables and liquidize. Season with salt and pepper to
taste. (Salsify is a long, thin, darkly earth-coloured root, can be
found in greengrocers's shops in February, also available as
preserved ; when scrubbed, it is revealed to be white whithout an
obvious outer skin. Also known as "vegetable oysters" ~ some
curiously salt, fishy flavour - or as "poor people's asparagus")
