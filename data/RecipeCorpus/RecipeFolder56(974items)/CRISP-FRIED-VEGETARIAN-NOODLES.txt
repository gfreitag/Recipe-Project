Categories: Main dish, Asian, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Thin egg noodles
Sesame oil
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Rice wine
1 1/2 ts Sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 tb Garlic, minced
1 1/2 tb Ginger, minced
10 ea Chineese black mushrooms
- rehydrated
3 c  Leeks, finely julliened
2 c  Carrots, shredded
1 1/2 tb Rice wine
4 c  Bean sprouts
Heat 1 gallon water in large pan until boiling.  Add noodles and cook
until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Toss with 1-2 teaspoons
sesame oil. Immediately transfer noodles to round cake pan or pie
plate. Press top to level noodles and let cool.  This can be made a
day ahead and refridgerated. In the meantime, cut leeks & re-hydrated
mushroom caps into fine julienne strips.  Discard mushroom stems.
Rinse and drain bean sprouts. When noodles have cooled, combine
broth, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and
cornstarch in bowl. Blend well. Heat well-seasoned wok or skillet
until very hot. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil and heat until
nearly smoking.  Invert noodle cake into pan and cook until
deep-golden brown, swirling pan from time to time to keep cake from
sticking. Flip noodle cake over and brown other side. Transfer
noodles to heat-proof serving platter and keep warm in oven at 200
degrees. Reheat pan and add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable
oil. Again, heat until very hot.  Add garlic and ginger-root and
stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds.  Add mushrooms, carrots,
and leeks. Stir-fry over high heat about 1 minute.  Add rice wine and
cook one minute more. Then add sauce mixture and bring to boil. Add
bean sprouts and cook, stirring constantly to prevent lumps, until
sauce is thickened. Spoon vegetables over fried noodle cake and serve
immediately.
