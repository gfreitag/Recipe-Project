Title: CREAMED CHICKEN & BISCUITS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
4    Biscuits
1/2 lb Chicken breast meat
-- (boneless, skinless)
3    Button mushrooms
3    Shiitake mushrooms
-- OR other wild mushrooms
1 tb Butter
1 tb Red bell pepper
-- (finely chopped)
1 tb Green bell pepper
-- (finely chopped)
1/2 tb Jalapeno pepper
-- (finely chopped)
3/4 c  Heavy cream
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Have the biscuits ready to slip into the oven to bake as you begin to
prepare the chicken.

Cut the chicken into 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Slice the mushrooms, and
if you are using shiitakes, discard the stems. Heat the butter in a
skillet; when it stops foaming, add the chicken and mushrooms and
saute over moderate heat for 4 minutes.  Add the peppers and cook,
stirring, over high heat for 1 more minute.

Pour the cream into the skillet and cook until it has reduced and
thickened, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, split 4 warm biscuits and divide them between 2 plates.
Cover them with the creamed chicken.
