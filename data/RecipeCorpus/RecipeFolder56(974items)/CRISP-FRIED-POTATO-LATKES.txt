Vegetable Oil Applesauce Sour Cream or Plain Yogurt

Shred or grate the poatoes althernately with the onion to keep the
potatoes from darkening.  (The size of the shreds is a matter of
personal taste.) Coarse shreds produce lacier latkes with rough
edges. Fine shreds or grated potatoes produce denser, smoother
latkes.) Squre the excess liquid from the potato and onion shreds.
Mix in the eggs, salt, pepper and matzo meal (or flour).  Let the
mixture rest for about 5 mins., so that the matzo meal can absorb
some moisture.  If the mixture still seems very wet, add a bit more
matzo meal.

In a very large skillet, over med.-high heat, heat oil that is about
1/8-1/4" deep until it is very hot but not smoking. To form each
latke, use a large spoon to transfer some of the potato mixture to
the oil; then flatten the mixture slightly with the back of a spoon.
The latkes will be irregularly shaped.  An alternative method (which
makes more evenly shaped latkes) is to press some of the potato
mixture into a large serving spoon; then carefully slide it off the
spoon into the hot oil.

Continue making latkes until the skillet is full, leaving a little
room between each one.  Fry the latkes until they are well browned on
both sides and crisp around the edges. Drain them well on paper
towels. Repeat the process until all the latkes are fried.

Serve the latkes as soon as possible for the best taste and texture.
Accompany the latkes with applesauce, sour cream, and/or yogurt, as
desired.
