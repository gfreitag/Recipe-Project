1/4 c  Sesame seeds
1/4 c  Chopped hazelnuts
3 tb Coriander seeds
2 tb Cuminseed
3/4 ts Salt
2 md Onions, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, chopped fine
3 tb Olive oil
1 lb Dried chick-peas,picked over
5    Cups chicken broth
6 c  Water plus additional for
-thinning soup
2    Bay leaves
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1/2 ts White peppercorns
MAKE DUKKAH: In an 8-inch dry skillet saute all dukkah ingredients
except salt over moderately high heat, stirring and being careful not
to burn spices, until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Cool dukkah
and in a spice grinder or cleaned electric coffee grinder grind fine.
Transfer dukkah to a small bowl and stir in salt. Dukkah may be made
1 week ahead and chilled, covered. MAKE SOUP: In a heavy kettle cook
onions and garlic in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until
softened. Add remaining soup ingredients and simmer, covered, 2 1/2
hours, or until chick-peas are very tender. Cool soup, uncovered, 15
minutes and discard bay leaves. In a blender or food processor puree
soup in batches, straining each batch through a fine sieve into a
large bowl, pressing hard on solids. Soup may be prepared up to this
point 5 days ahead and chilled, covered. In kettle reheat soup over
moderate heat, stirring occasionally and adding additional water to
thin to desired consistency, until hot. Ladle soup into small coffee
cups and sprinkle with dukkah. Makes about 11 cups, serving 16 to 20
as a hearty hors d'oeuvre.
