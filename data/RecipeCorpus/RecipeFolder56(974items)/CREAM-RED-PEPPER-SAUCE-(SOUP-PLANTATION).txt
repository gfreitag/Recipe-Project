Title: CREAM RED PEPPER SAUCE (SOUP PLANTATION)
Categories:
Yield: 8 Servings
12 oz Red bell peppers -- roasted
3/4 c  Sour cream
2 tb Dry white wine
Salt and pepper
Red bell peppers -- strips
Roast your own peppers or purchase a 10 ounce jar. Drain the peppers.
Use food processor to puree. In a small saucepan heat the peppers over
medium-low heat for about 2 minutes or till bubbly. Gradually whisk
in the sour cream, wine, salt and ground pepper. Heat through but do
not boil.

Important!  Heat individual plates.  Spoon hot sauce over hot, drained
pasta and garnish with fresh bell pepper slivers (optional). Eat
immediately.

Variation from Soup Plantation Restaurants--  Use V8 instead of wine.
Offer with radiatore, twists, 'little helmets' or spinach fettuccine
or linguine

This is a last-minute sauce that needs to be eaten hot. Sauce for
pasta but can be used on chicken or vegetables like cauliflower. The
richness may be too-too for some tastes. Also offer bread.
