The Croquembouche pyramid must be assembled quickly, or the syrup
used to assemble it will harden and have to be reheated. Therefore,
be sure to read the recipe through thoroughly before starting to
work. And have all ingredients near the stove, so you dip the puffs
and set them in place quickly.

Cut a 9-inch circle from cardboard, and cover with foil. Set the
circle on a board near the stove.  Have the filled cream puffs close
at hand.

Cook corn syrup in the top of a double boiler over high heat until
candy thermometer reaches hard-ball stage(240F), or until a small
drop of the syrup forms a soft ball in coldwater. Set pan over
boiling water.

To build the pyramid, lightly dip the bottom oof a cream puff in
syrup and set on the edge of the circle, syrup-side down. Repeat with
9 more puffs, forminga ring. For the secong row,arrange a slightly
smaller ring of puffs overthe spaces between the puffs in the first
row, inclinin g the second row slightly inward. Fill in the center
with more puffs for support.

Continue building the pyramid in decreasing rings, filling in cent er
for support as needed, until you have completed 8 rows.

Top with one puff,. Sprinkles the Croquembouche lightly with 1/4 cup
siftedicingsugar. To serve, lift one ortwo puffes at a time off the
pyramid, starting from the top. Serves 8 - 10.
