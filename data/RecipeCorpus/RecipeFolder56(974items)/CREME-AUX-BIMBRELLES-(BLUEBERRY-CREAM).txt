Always thought that Irma la Douce was a bimbrelle. Imagine my
surprise when I found out a bimbrelle is a type of huckleberry...

From the Lorraine region in northern France, this traditional recipe
utilises a variety of huckleberry called bimbrelle which grows wild
in the forests of the Vosges. However, it is, if anything, better
made with cultivated blueberries.

Put 750 g of blueberries into a saucepan and reduce to 1 cup or so of
very thick puree.  Strain the puree, then add 175 g sugar and the
juice of a lemon.  Stir well to dissolve.

Melt 7 g gelatine in a tablespoon or so of water in a double boiler
over simmering water.  Add the gelatine to the berry puree, then add
200 fresh, whole blueberries. Refrigerate, keeping a close eye on the
mixture, and meanwhile whip 250 mL cream till barely mounding. As
soon as the gelatin shows signs of setting, fold in the cream then
turn the mixture into an oiled mould and refrigerate at least 4 hours.

Serve with more lightly whipped cream, sweetened and flavoured with 1
tablespoon of cognac.

Makes 6 servings.
