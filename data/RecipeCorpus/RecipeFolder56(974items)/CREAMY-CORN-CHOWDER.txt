Title: CREAMY CORN CHOWDER
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Reduced-fat chicken broth
1    Sweet red pepper, finely
Diced
3    Scallions, minced
1    Shallot, minced
1 tb Unbleached flour
2 c  Corn
1 3/4 c  Skim milk
Dash of nutmeg
1 ts Low-sodium soy sauce
Sweet red pepper rings
For garnish
Snipped fresh parsley
Place the broth in a 4-quart pot over medium heat. Add the peppers,
scallions and shallots.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the peppers
are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Add a bit of water, if necessary,
to prevent scorching.  Stir in the flour and cook until slightly
thickened, 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and
set aside. Place 1 cup of the corn in a blender or food processor
with 1 cup of the milk. Process on low until smooth. Add the
corn-milk mixture, the remaining corn, the remaining milk, nutmeg and
soy sauce to the peppers in the pot. Set over medium heat and bring
the mixture just to boiling, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and
simmer for about 5 minutes. Garnish with the red peppers and parsley.
