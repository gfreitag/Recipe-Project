In a small saucepan melt unsweetened chocolate and the margarine or
butter over low heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; cool.
Grease and lightly flour an 8x8x2-inch baking pan; set aside. In a
medium mixing bowl stir together flour, walnuts or pecans, and baking
powder; set aside. In a large mixing bowl stir together the cooled
melted chocolate mixture and the sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla.
Using a wooden spoon, lightly beat mixture just till combined. (Do
not overbeat or brownies will rise during baking, then fall and
crack.) Stir in the flour mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared
pan; spread to edges. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, for topping, in a small saucepan melt the semisweet or
bittersweet chocolate over low heat, stirring occasionally; cool
slightly. In a medium mixing bowl beat cream cheese with electric
mixer on medium speed about 30 seconds or till softened. Add the
melted semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, egg, sugar, milk, and
vanilla. Beat until combined. Carefully spread topping evenly over
hot brownies. Bake in the 350 degree oven about 10 minutes more or
till topping is set. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Cover; chill at
least 2 hours. To serve, cut brownies into triangles or bars. (To cut
into triangles, first cut into rectangles, then cut in half
diagonally.) If desired, in a small saucepan melt 2 squares chocolate
and shortening; drizzle over brownies and onto plate. Garnish with
raspberries, if desired. Cover and refrigerate to store. Makes 12 to
16 servings.
