Title: CREMA QUEMADA A LA CATALANA
Categories: Spain, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
6    Egg yolks, beaten
2 1/2 tb Cornstarch
1 1/4 c  Confectioners sugar
2 c  Milk
1    Cinnamon stick
Zest of 1 lemon
2 tb Brown sugar
Put the egg yolks in a bowl with the cornstarch and confectioners
sugar. Simmer the milk with the cinnamon stick and lemon zest, then
add the egg mixture and cook slowly, stirring to avoid lumps until
the custard thickens ~ do not boil it.

This may be done in a double boiler or in a saucepan placed in a
larger pan of simmering water. Remove the cinnamon stick and lemon
zest, divide the custard between 6 3-inch ramekins and leave in the
refrigerator overnight.

Before serving, sprinkle the top with brown sugar and leave for a few
seconds under a hot broiler, then cool. Do this about 30 minutes
beforehand so that the caramel remains crisp.

In Spain, the sugar is caramelized with a salamandra heated on a
brazier or gas flame. It is obtainable also in specialized shops in
the UK and the USA
