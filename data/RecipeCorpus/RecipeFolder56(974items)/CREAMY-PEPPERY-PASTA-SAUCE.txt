Title: CREAMY PEPPERY PASTA SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Chopped Onion
3 md Minced Garlic Cloves
28 oz Canned Whole Tomatoes
2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
1 tb Chopped Fresh Basil Leaves
Or:
1 ts Dried Basil
1/2 ts Dried Rosemary
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Ricotta Cheese (See Note)
1/3 c  Plain Yogurt (See Note)
We like this piquant tomato sauce, which is easy on the calories, but
if you are in the mood to indulge, try cream in place of the ricotta
and yogurt. ~------------------------------------------------------
~------------- ~-- In a large saucepan, heat the oil and saute the
onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Chop the tomatoes,
reserving the liquid. Add the tomatoes, 1/2 cup of the reserved
liquid, and the Tabasco sauce, basil, rosemary, and salt to the
saucepan and mix well. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, adding more
of the tomato liquid if the sauce is too thick. In a food processor
or blender, process the ricotta cheese and yogurt until smooth.  Stir
the mixture into the tomato sauce and heat without allowing it to
come to a boil. The sauce may look slightly grainy, but appears
smooth when it is added to hot pasta. NOTE: Low-fat ricotta and
yogurt can be used.
