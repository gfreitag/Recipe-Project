Title: CROQUE-MONSIEUR
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese
Yield: 4 Servings
8 sl White bread, crusts removed
1/4 pn Butter, softened
4 sl Ham
4 sl Thin natural gruyere
2 ea Eggs, slightly beaten
1 tb Water
Dash of salt and freshly
Grounded pepper
Spred the bread with some of the softened butter, make 4 sandwiches,
each with one slice of ham and one of cheese. Press firmly together.
Beat the eggs and water, salt and pepper and dip the sandwiches into
the egg mixture, coating all sides well. Heat the rest of the butter
in a heavy- bottomed skillet; when it is bubbly but not yet browned,
fry the sandwiches, turning once. Serve immediatly, (if you prefer
although it is not traditionnally done, you may place the
croque-monsieur into a very well-buttered baking pan and bake in a
moderately hot oven-- 350 d.F.-- turning once. It is easier to
prepare a larger number this way and keep them warm till ready to
serve.)
