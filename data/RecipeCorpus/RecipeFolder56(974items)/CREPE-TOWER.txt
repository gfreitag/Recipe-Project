Title: CREPE TOWER
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
24    Crepes (make above recipe in
Double
Batch)
1 pk Thawed frozen chopped
Spinach -- (10 ounces)
Squeezed dry and cooked with
Clove,
Minced garlic in 2
1 tb Olive oil - with or without
1/2    Cup
Slivered smoked ham or
Proscuitto
Cheese sauce (see above
Recipe)
1 c  Ricotta cheese mixed with 1
Egg and 1/2
c  Slivered roasted peppers
3 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-inch deep pie
plate and center a crepe in the bottom. Mix the spinach filling with
1/2 cup of the cheese sauce and spread some of this over the first
crepe. Center a crepe on top of spinach filling and spread it with
ricotta cheese and pepper filling. Top with a crepe and continue this
way until you end with a crepe. Spoon cheese sauce over the top of
the tower and sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes or
until bubbling hot.

You can assemble the "tower" of crepes and fillings in advance and
make the sauce in advance, but spoon sauce over crepes right before
baking. If you have made this in advance and it is cold you will have
to bake it for
45    minutes to heat it through.

Yield: 4 dinner servings
