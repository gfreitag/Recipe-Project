Title: CRESCENT'S EGGS IN HELL
Categories: Eggs
Yield: 4 Servings
4 ts Oil; olive
1    Onion; chopped
1    Green pepper; diced
2    Garlic cloves; pressed
1 c  Tomatoes; 20 oz with juice
4 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Basil
1/2 ts Oregano
1 ts Rosemary
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Honey
4 lg Eggs
In  oil  saute  onion,  green pepper and garlic. While they soften,
stir in tomatoes and their juice (break the tomatoes up a bit),
tomato paste, basil, oregano, rosemary, bay leaf and honey. Simmer
sauce for about 10 minutes, then make indentations in it with a spoon
and break into it 4-6 eggs.  Spoon sauce around and cover them, pop
on a cover, and let the whole thing simmer gently until the eggs are
poached; the whites should be medium firm, the yolks still runny.
Lift each egg out with a spatula onto a serving plate in which you've
placed a bed of cooked spaghetti or a thick slice of toasted french
bread or a bed of hot, steaming rice, or a tortilla if you want it
Mexican-style. Spoon extra sauce around each egg and sprinkle with
grated parmesan cheese. From: Dairy Hollow House Cookbook from
