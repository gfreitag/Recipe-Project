Here's another of the Winners series.  This one might be a bit time
consuming, buy there aren't any really exotic ingredients and, unless
you get into garnishing it the way it shows in the book, not too much
hassle. These are "mock" chicken legs++a minced mixture of meat and
seafood rolled up and deep fried.  I'd use the rice paper option for
wrappers as they are readily available, at least around here. The
basket garnish is an incredibly fussy little number actually woven
from strips of potatoes. I'd use the two seive potato nest trick for
that part if I bothered at all. The small crabs that go into the
basket really are small crabs++ about two inches across the shell.
They look neat, but add nothing to the dish aside from that.

Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Meat "South of the
Yangtse River Crispy Leg" sounds prosaic in English, but to a Chinese
the geographic description has many happy associations++ scenic
beauty, ancient traditions, a land where poets found peace. The
promise of crispy legs in the dish evokes the image of Cantonese
favorite - crispy chicken drumsticks yet the diner senses that there
is a surprise treat in the dish.

1.  Optional basket garnish:  Steam crabs and put aside. Form
potatoes into basket shapes.  This can be done by peeling them into
long strips, which are then interwoven', and sealed with cornstarch
paste. Deep-fry baskets over medium flame until golden. 2. Slice all
filling ingredients at an angle, and cut into dia- mond shapes (which
creates a better texture). Season with seasoning mixture. 3. Slice
bamboo shoots into 12 strips each 5 cms long and 0.5 cms wide. 4.
Divide pork caul lining into 12 triangular pieces (large enough to
wrap "legs"). Cut ham into 24 strips. On to each pork caul lining lay
one sprig of coriander, 2 strips of ham, and 1/12 of the diamond-cut
filling ingredients. Place one strip of bamboo shoot on top, with
half of it left outside wrapping. Fold and mould each filled pork
caul lining into leg shape. 5. Mix coating ingredients with 2 tbs
water, and coat each "leg" with the paste. 6. Mix Hoisin sauce with
water, and simmer till thickened.

To cook Carefully slide "legs" into medium-hot oil (sufficient to
deep-fry all twelve at same time), with folded "leg" ends facing
centre of wok. Deep-fry for 3 minutes, then increase heat a little
and continue deep- frying for a further 3 minutes.

To present 1. Lay "legs" on a paper doily in serving dish, arranging
the potato baskets and crabs as a central garnish. 2. Serve the
Hoisin sauce mixture on the side. From "Champion Recipes of the 1986
