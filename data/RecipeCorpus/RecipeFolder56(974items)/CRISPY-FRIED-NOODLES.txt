Heat the oil to very hot.  Drop a handful of uncooked noodles into
the hot oil.  They will immediately puff up to several times their
size. Turn them over & quickly fry the other side. The entire process
only takes a few seconds.  Do not let the noodles brown. Drain on
paper towels. Make the SYRUP by combining the water & tamarind water
with sugar in a small pot. Cook over medium heat until it thickens.
Prepare the SEASONINGS by heating 1 tb vegetable oil in a wok or
skillet. Add the onion & garlic & stir-fry until lightly browned. Add
the tomato paste & soy sauce & stir-fry a further 3 minutes. Clean
the bean sprouts & remove the roots if you want. Place the noodles in
a large bowl & pour the SYRUP & SEASONINGS mixture over them at once
& mix thoroughly with your hands. Add the bean sprouts, cilantro &
green onions & mix again, being careful not to break the noodles into
too small pieces. Sprinkle with the red pepper flakes if desired &
serve with the lemon wedges.
