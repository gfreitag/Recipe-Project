Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Beef steak

1 tb Light soy sauce
2 ts Rice wine
1 ts Sesame oil

3 tb Cornstarch
1 tb All-purpose flour

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
5    Dried chiles; halved
3 tb Garlic, finely sliced
1 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Water
1 ts Cornstarch; mixed with
1 ts Water
PLACE THE MEAT in the freezer for about 20 minutes, or until it is
firm to the touch. Cut it into slices against the grain, then finely
shred the slices. Combine the meat with the marinade and mix very
well. Soak the dried chiles in warm water. When they are soft and
pliable, cut them in half. Heat a wok or large skillet until it is
hot. Add the 2 cups of oil and when it is very hot and almost
smoking, deep-fry the beef in 2 batches. Remove with a slotted spoon
and drain the meat in a colander. Heat a small saucepan and when it
is hot, add the 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, garlic and chilies and
stir-fry for 20 seconds. Then add the rest of the sauce ingredients
and simmer for 2 minutes. Keep warm. Reheat the oil in the wok until
it is very hot. Deep-fry the beef again until it is very crisp, about
1 minute. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels
and place on a warm platter. Gently toss the beef with the sauce and
serve immediately. Serves 4 as part of a Chinese meal, or 2 as a
single dish.
