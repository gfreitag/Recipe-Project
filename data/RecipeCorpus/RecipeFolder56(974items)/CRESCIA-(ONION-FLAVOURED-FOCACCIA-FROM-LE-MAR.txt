2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Onions, finely chopped
1 1/2 tb Olive oil

Stir the yeast into a small bowl & let proof for 10 minutes. Stir in
the rest of the water & oil.  Whisk in 2 c of the flour & stir till
smooth. Add salt & the rest of the flour, 1 c at a time. Knead for 8
to 10 minutes until soft & velvety.  Place in a lightly oiled bowl,
cover & let rise till doubled. While the dough is rising, prepare the
topping. Warm the olive oil over low heat & saute the onions for
about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Cut the dough into 2
pieces, one twice as large as the other. Shape the smaller one to fit
an oiled 10" round pie plate & the larger one to fit an oiled 10 1/2"

appear in the dough but it has not quite doubled. Heat the oven to

& drizzle with olive oil & finish with the salt. Bake for 25 minutes
until the onions are golden. Cool on wire racks. VARIATION: Crescia
al Rosmarino.  Substitute 2 tb finely chopped rosemary for the onions.
