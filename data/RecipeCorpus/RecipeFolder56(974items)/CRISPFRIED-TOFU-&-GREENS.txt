Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-==========================
Ingredients:

2 cakes  of tofu, frozen overnight and thawed 1/2 cup water or
vegetable stock 1 tsp cornstarch 1/2 cup cornmeal or cornstarch

Marinade:

1/3 cup   soy sauce 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1 tblsp finely grated
gingerroot 2 cloves  garlic, minced or pressed dash cayenne

Sauce:

3 tblsp  soy sauce 1/4 cup dry sherry 2 tsp rice vinegar 2 tsp honey
or brown sugar

Vegetables:

3 tblsp   oil 3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed 1 cup thinly sliced
mix of coarsely chopped pak choi, chard, kale, nappa
onion 6 cup
cabbage or 9 cup chopped spinach Gently squeeze as much liquid out of
thawed tofu as possible.  Cut tofu crosswise into 1/2inch thick
slices, then diagonally, to make 4 triangles.* Combine marinade
ingredients and mix well. Arrange tofu triangles in one layer in a
dish and cover with marinade. Allow to sit for at least 10 minutes to
absorb the flavors. Prepare sauce mix by combining all ingredients in
a small bowl. In a separate bowl mix the water or stock and the 1
tsp.  cornstarch. Dredge marinated tofu pieces in cornmeal or
cornstarch and fry over medium heat in 1/8 to 1/4 inch of oil, for 34
minutes on each side.  Drain and keep warm in 200F oven.

Add leftover marinade to sauce mix.  Heat 3 tblsp  oil in a wok.
Stirfry garlic and onion until onion is tender. Add greens and
continue stirfrying until just wilted but not mushy. Add sauce mix
and cornstarch mix and stirfry just until sauce is thickened.  Add
reserved fried tofu. Serve with rice.
