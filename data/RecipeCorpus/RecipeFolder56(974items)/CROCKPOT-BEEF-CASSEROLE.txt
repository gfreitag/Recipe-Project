Categories: Casseroles, Crockpot

2 lb Stewing beef, cubed
Seasoned flour
1    Onion, thinly sliced
4 oz Mushrooms, sliced
1 cn 10 oz can, beef/oxtail
-/tomato soup or
1/2 pt Beef stock
Salt and pepper
Dried mixed herbs (opt)
Oil or lard for frying
Coat the meat with the flour.  Saute the onion in the oil and
transfer to the slow cooker.  Brown the meat and place on top of the
onions. Add the mushrooms and herbs, then pour over the soup or
stock, and cook on High for 4 - 5 hours or on Low for 8 - 10 hours.

that less liquid is needed than with conventional cooking, and the
vegetables must be placed in the bottom of the crockpot with the meat
on top.
