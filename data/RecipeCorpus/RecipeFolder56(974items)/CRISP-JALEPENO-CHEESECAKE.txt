32 oz Cream cheese

Combine all crust ingredients;  press into the bottom of a 10 inch
spring form pan;  bake for 10 minutes at 350f; cool Beat the cream
cheese and sour cream until smooth; add all other cheese cake
ingredients slowly, beating after each addition until smooth; pour
onto crust; bake 1 hour at 225f. Combine all topping ingredients;
whip to a froth; pour over cheesecake; bake 15 minutes at 300f. Cool
slowly; chill before serving Garnish with whipped topping or fruit as
desired. NOTE: It is supposed to be a little mushy when done rather
than solid like most cheesecakes, however if you prefer a "normal"
cheesecake raise the temp about 25 degrees and cook a little longer.
The original recipe called for serving warmed (nuked), I like it
chilled with "Union Grill Strawberry Sauce" on top
