Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Rolled oats
1 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Icing sugar
2 tb Dark rum or Scotch whiskey
"In Scotland Cream Crowdie was tradtionally served on Strove
Tuesday..."

Preheat oven to 400F. Spread oats evenly over bottom of oven a 9" or
10" pan layer cake cake pan and toast in middleo f oven, shaking pan
occasionally for about 15 minutes or until flakes are rich golden
brown colour. Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate
heat accordingly. Set aside to cool. In large chilled bowl, whip
cream with whisk or rotary beater until it begins to thicken. Add
icing sugar and beat until cream is firm enough to form unwavering
peaks on beater when lifted out of bowl. Lightly stir in rim (I think
whisket would be more traditional); a Tbspful at a time. Then with a
rubber spatula, gently but thoroughly fold in toasted oatmeal. Pile
cream into chilled individual serving bowls or into parfait glasses
and serve at once. SERVES:4
