Title: CREOLE RED-BEAN PATTIES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 12 Servings
4 c  Cooked red or pink beans,
Drained
4    Green onions, sliced thin
1/2    Red bell pepper, chopped
1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 ts Cayenne
Tabasco to taste
1/2 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1.  In a food processor or blender, combine beans, onions, red pepper,
parsley, cayenne, Tabasco, thyme, and garlic powder. Process until
smooth. 2. Flour your hands and shape the bean puree into 12
patties (about 3/4"
thick and 2 1/2" in diameter). 3. Spray a skillet with cooking
spray and heat.  Cook patties for 5
minutes on each side.

If you want additional texture, chop the beans instead. Treat
the patties like burgers; serve them with buns with onion rings,
lettuce, and tomato slices with ketchup or mustard. Nutritional
