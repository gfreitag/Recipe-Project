Title: CREAM-CORN PUDDING
Categories: Breakfast, Desserts, Vegetables
Yield: 5 Servings
1 cn Cream-style corn
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
2    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 tb Butter (optional)
In a large, oven-proof mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except
butter; beat well together.  Top with butter if desired. Bake at
350-f 35 min, or until set.

Note:  I would advise _NOT_ trying this in the microwave; I have
attempted an MW method, and the mixture did not set.

Variations: Before baking, stir in a heaping tablespoon of raisins,
currants, or berries. For the last ten minutes of baking, top with
fine graham wafer or cornflake crumbs. For a delicious and hearty
breakfast, place banana slices in the bottom of a soup bowl, and
spoon leftover pudding over top.  Microwave until heated through; add
a little milk if desired. The pudding will keep in the refrigerator
for at least a week.
