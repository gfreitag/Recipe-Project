Title: CROWN ROAST POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables, Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Baking potatoes (medium)
1/4 ts Celery salt
1/4 ts Onion salt
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1 ts The herb mix you are using
-on the roast
Now: Potatoes (around the roast)-- say, 4 servings. I know, you are
two people but *I* eat like two people all by myself! If you really
feel you both eat like birds-- halve everything for 2-3 servings.

Diresctions:  Wash and peel the potatoes (you can just scrub them if
you wish); cut potatoes lengthwise-- 8 wedges. Figure you add them 1
1/4 -2 hrs before the roast is done; overlap potaoes as little as
possible and dot with butter/margarine. sprinkle with the herbs and
the onion & celery salts. Add a little ground peppper if you like.
Check potatoes and remove when tender and be sure to turn and baste
them with those great pan drippings once or twice while cooking!
