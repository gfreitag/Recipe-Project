Title: CROWN ROAST OF FRANKFURTERS WITH BAKED BEANS
Categories: Meats, Holidays
Yield: 8 Servings
3    (16 oz.) cans baked beans
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1/3 c  Packed dark brown sugar
2 ts Dijon mustard
3 pk (12 oz. ea.) frankfurters
(about 21 total)
Preheat oven to 400F.  IN a medium saucepan, combine baked beans,
onion, brown sugar and mustard.  Stir until well mixed. Cook over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until beans are hot, 10 to 15
minutes.

Meanwhile, rinse frankfurters and blot dry with paper towels. Spear 3
hotdogs together by pushing a toothpick horizantally thorugh upper
third of franks. Repeat with remaining weiners.

Place a 6-inch-tall 1 1/2 to 2 quart baking dish about 4 1/2 inches in
diameter (such as a bean pot) on an ovenproof serving platter. Lean
frankfurters, skewered ends up, around outside edge of bean pot. Tie a
piece of kitchen string around center of franks to secure them in a
circle. Remove toothpicks.

Transfer hot beans from saucepan to pot in center of franks and place
platter and all in oven.  Bake until weiners are golden brown and
beans are bubbly, about 25 minutes. To serve, spoon beans directly
form pot and use tongs to remove frankfurters.

This is sure to be a kid pleaser at celebrations where adult food
would not be appreciated.  I can remember, when I was a kid, my
grandmother for New Year's Day celebrations would always serve
Lutefisk - (which I hated - it just stood there on the platter - a
gelatinous - fish smelling opaque mess that shook like a live
jellyfish and we kids were expected to eat it). I would far rather
have had hot dogs!
