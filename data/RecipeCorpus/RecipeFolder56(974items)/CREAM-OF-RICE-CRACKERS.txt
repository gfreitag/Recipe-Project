Title: CREAM OF RICE CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 95 Servings
1 1/2 c  Cream of rice, regular or
Quick cooking
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2/3 c  Milk
"If you have a food mill, make your own cream of rice by grinding
whole rice to a medium coarsness. The difference in taste between
this and the commercial cereals is as marked as that between ordinary
and freshly ground coffee.

20 to 25 minutes
325~ F

Preheat the oven to 325~ F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the cream of rice,
flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Slowly blend in enough of the milk to form a dough that
will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a sharp
knife, cut the dough into 2-inch shapes.

Place the crackers on an ungreased baking sheet and prick each one
all the way through in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake
for 20 to 25 minutes, or until light golden brown. Cool on a rack.
Yield: 85-95.

VARIATIONS: Substituting half-and-half or cream for the milk will
result in a richer cracker.

For a different taste, substitute cream of wheat or cream of rye
cereals for the cream of rice.
