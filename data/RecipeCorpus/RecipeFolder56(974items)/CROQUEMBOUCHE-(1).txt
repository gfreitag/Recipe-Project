Use cream whipped stiff with sugar and vanilla, to taste. Such a
gorgeous dessert - you say it "croak-em-boosh" - you'll need a pastry
bag with a 1/4" tip to fill the tiny puffs with whipped cream.
Preheat oven to 375. Boil water and butter together. Remove from
heat, ad flour all at once beating rapidly till dough forms a ball.
(If it doesn't, put it back over medium heat and keep beating.)  Cool
7 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating frantically after each
till dough is smooth. Butter and flour cookie sheets and drop by
small teaspoonfuls 2" apart and bake 16 minutes until brown and
puffed. Put a little slit in each one, put them back in oven for 10
minutes more. Cool completely. Fill them from bottom with whipped
cream. Refrigerate till ready to assemble. Make the caramel and pile
puffs into a pyramid using caramel as glue - dip bottoms. Make th
chocolate and dribble it over all. CARAMEL FILLING: Bring to a simmer
~ swirl pan till sugar dissolves.  Cover, bring to boil, when bubbles
are thick, uncover and swirl till light brown - remove from heat.
CHOCOLATE TOPPING: Stir constantly over low heat till melted. Sauce
will harden as it cools.
