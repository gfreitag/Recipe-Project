From the "Japanese Country Cookbook, " by Russ Rudsinski.

Combine egg, vinegar and 1/4 cup of the oil in a blender. Process
until creamy. Slowly add remaining oil at high speed until mixture
resembles mayonnaise. Transfer to a bowl and add sour cream, soy
sauce, main and broth.

Place sauce in small individual dishes for each diner.

Editor's note: According to studies, uncooked eggs may not be safe
since, in rare instances, they may carry salmonella. If you are
reluctant to eat raw egg, an egg substitute such as Egg Beaters may
be used.
