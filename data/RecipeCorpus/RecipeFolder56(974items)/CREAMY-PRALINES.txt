Title: CREAMY PRALINES
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  C&H Golden Brown Sugar
1 c  C&H Granulated Sugar
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Maple flavoring
1 1/2 c  Pecans
Combine sugars, milk, and salt in a 3-quart saucepan. Slowly bring to
a boil and cook to 236 degrees (soft-ball stage), stirring almost
constantly. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Add flavoring and
nuts, then stir until mixture begins to thicken.  Drop quickly by
tablespoonful onto waxed paper or buttered pan, making 2-1/2" to 3"
patties. To prevent hardening of candy in pan, set over hot water
while spooning out. Makes 15 to 20 pralines.
