Title: CROCKPOT RED BEANS
Categories: None, Crockpot
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Red kidney beans; soaked
-overnight in water
1 1/2 c  White rice
16 oz Tomato, stewed
1    Ham hock
1 ts Basil
1 ts Thyme
1    Onion; chopped
2    Garlic clove; OR
1/4 ts Garlic powder
White pepper; to taste
Salt; to taste
I put the everything in the crockpot at the same time, except for the
rice. Turn on high for 4 hours, then on low for 6 hours. During the
last 1 1/2 hour,put in the rice. The final ingredient is about 1/2
cup of white wine. You can add this whenever.  It is optional, of
course. My husband really likes it spicy so he adds 1/8 tsp red
pepper. Enjoy! Mary Mann from Dallas
