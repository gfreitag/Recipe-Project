Yield: 1 Batch
4 c  ;Water
8 oz New red-skinned potatoes

1 lg Cauliflower head; rinsed

1 lg Fresh garlic head
-- cloves separated & peeled
1 c  Fresh fava beans or

quarter them.

Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer over high
heat. Place the potatoes in the steamer basket, cover, and cook until
they begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add the cauliflower stems,
garlic cloves and fava beans; cover and steam until the stems begin
to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add cauliflower florets and steam until
they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Then add zucchini, and the
turnips if you are using them. Cover; steam until zucchini has
softened and begun to turn translucent, about 8 minutes.

While vegetables are steaming, coarsely chop the herbs, then whisk
them together with the olive oil in a large serving bowl. Transfer
the steamed vegetables to the bowl, toss gently and serve immediately.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
