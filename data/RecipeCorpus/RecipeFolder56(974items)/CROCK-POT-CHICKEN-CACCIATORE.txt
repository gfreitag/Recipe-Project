Title: CROCK-POT CHICKEN CACCIATORE
Categories: Poultry, Pot roast, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Onion, medium; sliced
1    Celery stalk w/leaves
- cut in 1-inch pieces
2 cn Tomato paste; 6 oz. each
- 1 can w/garlic
1/2 c  Chianti; or any wine
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Creole seasoning
1    Bay leaf
6    Mushrooms, large; sliced
3    Garlic cloves
1/2 ts Basil
2 ts Oregano
1    Chicken, whole, about 3 lbs.
Place sliced onion in bottom of crock-pot.  Add chicken -- you can
either use a whole chicken or chop it up in pieces. Stir together
tomato paste (as indicated, I used 1 can of "regular" tomato paste
and 1 can with garlic), creole seasoning (I used Konriko brand),
pepper, garlic, herbs, and 1/4 cup of wine.  I went against
"tradition" and used a red wine. I like the way reds blend with
tomato sauces.  In this case, I used a light Chianti. Pour over
chicken.  Pour remaining wine over chicken as well. Cover and cook on
LOW for 7 to 9 hours (HIGH 3 to 4 hours).  Serve chicken over hot
buttered spaghetti, vermicelli, fettucini, or other pasta.
