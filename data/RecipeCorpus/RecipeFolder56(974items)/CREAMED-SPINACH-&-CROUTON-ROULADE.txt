Sponge:  Separate the eggs, and bring the whites to room temperature.
In a saucepan melt the butter over low heat, stir in the flour, and
cook the roux, stirring, for 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat
and add the milk, heated, in a stream, whisking. Simmer the mixture,
whisking occasionally, for five minutes, add the nutmeg and salt and
pepper to taste, and transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Whisk in
the egg yolks, one at a time, whisking well after each addition, and
whisk in the Parmesan.  In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg
whites with a pinch of salt until they are frothy, add the cream of
tartar, and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir
one third of the whites into the mixture and fold in the remaining
whites gently but thoroughly.

Spread the sponge batter evenly in a buttered 15-1/2"x10-1/2" jelly
roll pan lined with buttered and floured wax paper and bake it in a
preheated 350 oven for 25 minutes, or until it is golden and firm to
the touch. Cover the egg sponge with a sheet of buttered wax paper,
buttered side down, and a dish towel, invert a baking sheet over the
towel, and invert the egg sponge onto the baking sheet.  Remove the
jelly roll pan and the wax paper carefully and trim 1/4" from the
short sides of the sponge. Fill the sponge with the filling while it
is still warm and flexible.

Croutons:  Spread the bread cubes in one layer in a jelly roll pan.
In a small saucepan melt the butter with the garlic, drizzle the
mixture over the bread, and stir and toss the bread to coat it well.
Bake the bread in one layer in a preheated 350 oven, turning
occasionaly, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until croutons are golden.
Transfer the croutons to paper towels to drain.

Filling: Cook the spinach according to package directions, drain,
refresh under cold running water, and squeeze it dry. In a food
processor, puree the spinach with the butter, cream, and Parmesan and
season the filling with salt and pepper.

Spread the filling over the warm egg sponge in a even layer and
sprinkle it with the croutons. Roll the roulade jelly-roll fashion,
beginning with a long side, and trim the ends on the diagonal. With
the aid of the towel and the wax paper, transfer the roulade, seam
side down, to an ovenproof platter, spread it gently with the butter,
and sprinkle it with the Parmesan. Bake the roulade in a preheated
350 oven for 10 minutes, or until it is heated through and the
Parmesan is melted.
