Title: CRISP BEEF
Categories: Indonesian, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Lean Beef Chuck or Round
1    Clove Garlic, chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Fresh Ground Black Pepper
1 tb Dark Brown Sugar
1/2 tb Molasses
2 tb Lime Juice
1/4 ts Ground Coriander
1 c  Water
2 tb Peanut Oil
Cut the meat in thin slices along the grain, not across it. Pound the
slices until they almost fall apart. Put the meat and all the other
ingredients except the Oil in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over
high heat, then reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring now
and then, until the liquid has evaporated. Remove the meat and tear
it into fine strips using two forks. Scrape the bottom of the pan to
gather the residue, add the oil and set it over Medium heat. When the
oil is hot add the meat shreds and fry, stirring, until they are
crisp and dark brown. Drain on paper towels before serving.
