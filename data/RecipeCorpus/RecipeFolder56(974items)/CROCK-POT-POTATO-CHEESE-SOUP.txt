Place potatoes, chives, celery, parsley, onion, paprika, celery seed,

until potatoes are done. Combine milk and flour in a tightly covered
jar and shake to blend evenly. In a small saucepan, melt butter over
medium heat. Add flour mixture slowly, and stir constantly 3-4
minutes. Add cheese; stir until melted. Turn crock-pot to high
setting. Add cheese mixture to soup and cook until slightly
thickened. Serve hot in bowls and garnish with chives, sour cream or
bacon bits. From: Sharon Stevens Date: 10 Sep 94
