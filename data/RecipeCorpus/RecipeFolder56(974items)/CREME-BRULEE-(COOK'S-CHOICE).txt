Preheat oven to 325 degrees and set rack in the middle level. Place a
shallow 1 1/2 quart baking dish in a larger pan, such as a roasting
pan. (Or use six individual molds.)

Combine cream, sugar and vanilla beans in a saucepan and bring to a
boil, stirring once or twice to dissolve sugar.

Whisk the yolks in a bowl. Strain the cream mixture to remove the
vanilla beans, then whisk the hot cream into the yolks. Skim the
surface of the custard mixture and pour it into the mold.

Bake the cream about 1 hour until set, but still very pale on the
surface. Remove the mold from the pan of water and cool on a rack.
Wrap and refrigerate several hours or overnight.

To caramelize the top of the Creme Brulee, unwrap and blot surface
with a paper towel. Sprinkle an even 1/16-inch layer of sugar on the
surface. Run mold under preheated broiler (leave door open) or use a
blow torch to caramelize sugar. Serve as soon as sugar hardens.
