SHORTCAKE

SIFT TOGETHER THE FLOUR, sugar and salt on a wooden pastry board.
Make a well in the center and add butter, eggs and lemon rind. Mix
and knead with the fingertips taking care not to handle too much.
When smooth, shape into a ball and chill for about 30 minutes. Roll
out lightly in a circle, cut edges and keep dough about 1 inch larger
than a 8- to 9-inch (diameter) fluted flan tin. Butter and flour the
pan and fit the pastry into it, again trim the edges, prick with fork
and flute edges. Place in preheated oven at moderate heat for 15 to
20 minutes.

CREMA PASTICCERA Beat together yolks and sugar until slightly
thickened and a light lemon color. Beat in flour and vanilla. Over
medium heat, bring milk just to the boil. Let it cool for a moment,
then add it to the egg mixture, whisking rapidly. Cook over low heat
until the pastry cream thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden
spoon. Cool. When crema pasticcera is cool, spread evenly on the
bottom of the pie. Fill with whatever fresh fruits are available and
glaze with an apricot jam. Melt apricot jam glaze with a little hot
water. This recipe will serve 6 people.
