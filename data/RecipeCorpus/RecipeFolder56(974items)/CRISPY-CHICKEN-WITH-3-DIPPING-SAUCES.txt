Cut each chicken-breast in half crosswise into 2 pieces.  One at a
time, dip chicken-breast pieces and drumsticks in beaten egg, then
into walnut mixture to coat; place in jelly-roll pans. Spray chicken
pieces with olive oil. Bake chicken, on 2 oven racks, 30 to 35

Serve chicken hot with dipping sauces.  Or, cool chicken slightly;
cover and refrigerate to serve cold later with sauces.
