CRUMPET--A small, patty-cake-shape, unsweetened, leavened bread made
of flour, milk, butter, salt, yeast, and egg. The word comes from the
Middle Eng- lish word for "wafer." Crumpet dough is stiff but can be
spoon-beaten and spoon- dropped for shaping. Crumpets are cooked
twice, first on a griddle until well risen and browned on both sides;
then they are split and toasted to complete the cooking. They are
served hot with butter and jam.

The British dote on them for tea and, when away from home, they wax
soulful at the thought of fresh, hot buttered crumpets eaten before
an open fire. Although they are similar to their English-muffin
cousins, crumpets are softer in texture with surface holes appearing
during the pan cooking; these holes enable them to absorb great
quantities of butter.
