New Orleans' most popular sausage, a type of country sausage made with
pork, or pork and beef. It's not really smoked, but has a fine smokey
flavor that makes it an ideal seasoning meat for our favorite bean
dishes, gumbos, and jambalayas.  We also like it pan grilled as a
breakfast or dinner sausage. [Also makes great po-boys--ECT] Allow
about 20 to 25 minutes for grilling. When used as a seasoning meat in
other dishes, it requires no precooking. About 6 pounds of 6-8 inch
sausage (To make HOT sausage, omit the liquid hickory smoke and add 1
tsp cayenne and 1 tsp black pepper.)  Hot sausage is a good
accompaniment to bean dishes or smothered vegetables or as a
breakfast sausage with grits and eggs. It is not recommended as a
seasoning meat in traditional bean dishes as it is likely to
overwhelm the flavor of the other ingredients. Prepare the sausage
casings and stuffing. Mix ingredients lightly; the stuffing should be
slightly coarse in texture.  Cut the casing into 12 inch lengths and
stuff.  Allow 2 smoked sausages per serving.
