# Recipe-Project

This is a personal project for training a machine learning model on food recipes, using named entity recognition(NER). I downloaded over 140,000 recipes, and have about 200 annotated to be used in training and testing. The goal is to get the model good enough to assign tags correctly most of the time, and ultimately to complete a tbd task using unannotated data.

Makes use of the [Flair framework](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)
